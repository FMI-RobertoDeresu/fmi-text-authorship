0,00001,candidate00001, Hi Thanks for the invitation - the day sounds great. and will be there with bells and whistles (I have a friend coming in for the weekend so I won't be able to make it but thrilled that and are in the same class again). Talk to you soon. ,candidate00001
1,00002,candidate00001, yes positively- this day has been horrible - I'll call you on Wed ,candidate00001
2,00003,candidate00001, Here is the form of PG&E letter that we used after consultation with LaBoeuf - it has a few more words. ,candidate00001
3,00004,candidate00001, Hi Sorry I can't play - Tuesday is my husband's league night. Thanks though - I really enjoyed hitting on Sat and meeting your team. Talk to you soon. ,candidate00001
4,00005,candidate00001," I agree that Netco will also need to use WSPP and we should anticipate responding accordingly. For general conversation, though I still think we should recommend EEI. As we open up for contracting, I think , and I will be able to quickly identify those Caps who will only use WASP. ",candidate00001
5,00006,candidate00001," Great - go ahead and overnight to my home (I'm assuming email is unavailable?). Check it for early delivery and tell carrier service to leave on porch if nobody is home. My home address is 822 Columbia Street, Tx., 77007. Thanks ",candidate00001
6,00007,candidate00001, Here is the slightly revised TVA Confirmation Call with any questions. ,candidate00001
7,00008,candidate00001," So much wasted time and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards and marketers seems only to be increasing. I like the proposal to merge the discussions but... You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups. After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer ('s name came up a lot), he said he did not think it would ever work. I'm all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members, drafting committee and all, would relish it as well. What do you think is the next best step? ps - the meeting in San on the 1st is still unclear for based employees. Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly. We are trying to get to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK. Lets talk about this also. Hoping not to stay the course, again. Talk to you soon. ",candidate00001

10,00011,candidate00001, Hi Received your email but I don't have any particular knowledge in this area. I would assume but without any knowledge that an English judgment would be enforceable in the US ( I would assume that we give English law guarantees all the time for ISDA and other trading contracts which would have to be enforced against in the US) Maybe in London or Abrams ( corp attorney who works on guarantees ) would be able to help. Good luck. ,candidate00001

17,00018,candidate00001," As we discussed, EWS's documentation group is having a difficult time securing signed confirms for deals between EPMI/ENA and EES.

This language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals.

52,00053,candidate00001," I agree - a fundamental assumption of the MNA is that square setoff works and that you can setoff financial and physical commodity contracts. To make it work, all parties must sign the MNA. From there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of ""the lack of mutuality"" taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party.

Upon 's return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the modern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility. (CY - I think we were starting to recap the absurdity when Skilling suddenly resigned). But in the meanwhile a preview. The EEI creep was evident when Small after himself, personally, taking credit for drafting 's market disruption language (he said it was very time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI members who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours challenging certain concepts that originally proposed (as a result we will be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised). After hearing the new issues threw up his arms and asked that we propose new language. Afterwards, I spoke with , sorry , and proposed to meet with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, using the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evidence of what we could achieve together. He said theoretically that might be able to happen but he never saw it happening. I asked why. He said too painful. What pain. He said Stack. I said one bad day in Newport. He stopped talking. He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell him line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is something we can't miss so .... Maybe, at this meeting, and others can begin the writing of a world of one, a world where can make yet another name for himself. ",candidate00001

131,00021,candidate00003," Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01. From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01. That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market. However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance. Questions that need to be answered, ** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier? ** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?

All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract. Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Dec 2001 or Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001 that ENA has not paid for. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. Other items; ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ",candidate00003

I told him we locked them because we didn't want to get billed a potentially higher rate. 1) This guy acted like he knew me and of course I was embarrassed so I acted like I knew him, AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER TALKING TO THIS GUY. He knew that I had gone to EES and that was back in 1997-1998. 2) Sempra told that we would get more value if we let someone change the points. I wonder, even though we might get billed max rate, would it be possible to allow the replacement shipper to change the points for ""the term of the release only AND the releasing shipper would be billed more that max rate"" and that way the capacity would go back to its original contract points in October.

It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up. I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals.

273,00163,candidate00003," One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway. It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey. He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw. With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off! Now, the Moral of the Story: Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up! Remember the five simple rules to be happy: 1. Free your heart from hatred. 2. Free your mind from worries. 3. Live simply. 4. Give more. 5. Expect less. P.S.: The donkey later came back and kicked THE SHIT out of the bastard that tried burying him. Moral: When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you. ",candidate00003

Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU. There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity. It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too. We can chat about that next week.

358,00248,candidate00003," Maragaret, I have 2 prepays in this email. We will not need to wire money to Tennessee if we can get TXU set up as a supplier by 8:40 AM tomorrow. Note to all The first prepay is to TXU. I'm requesting $22,500.00 to be prepaid to TXU - that's about 5 days of supply for the Tallahassee deal. The second prepay is for 1 day of interruptible transportation on Tennessee. If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant, we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal. This is what we did on the 2nd-6th. I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th. My goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers (with prepays) on the East Coast, TXU and Reliant. I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier (maybe Coral) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA. Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent. However, last Thursday, Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes. So far we have spent 3 business days trying to secure another supplier. We will also be able to use TXU and Reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up. ",candidate00003

I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA. Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing and additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002. 's notes: Sonat Park & Loans 2/19/02 History - Per Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract. Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002, SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system. Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to , ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August. Other items; ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January. Sonat's in house legal counsel is (205-325-7696). I left a message for to call me. 2/20/02 returned my call. said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply. said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back. ",candidate00003

For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed.

530,00420,candidate00003," Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat. This is what we have found out over the last 2 days. ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract. Today I spoke with Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it. I need to know; 1. What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424. 2. What period do I sell the gas for? All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline? Or base load in April? I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok? 3. How many bids do I need to get? I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat. 4. This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below). will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas. I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it. All of my previous notes are shown below in blue. Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 2/19/02 History - Per Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract. Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002, SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system. Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to , ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August. Other items; ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January. Sonat's in house legal counsel is (205-325-7696). I left a message for to call me. 2/20/02 returned my call. said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply. said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back. 2/25/02 Per Mann - Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract. 1:10 PM. Left a follow-up message for regarding our conversation on 2/20/02. 3/11/02 Per - Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal. Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's. 3/13/02 Per - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled. called (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID. also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream. 3:30 PM Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it. She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination. I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out. 3:40 PM is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department. ",candidate00003

I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel. Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara). Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in. Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3). As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price. I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara. Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal. That's around $1,340,000.

But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal. I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat. We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat. I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward. ",candidate00003

Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost. However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below. For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou. The total transport cost is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month).

699,00589,candidate00003," i took the test and this is what it said. colors green blue yello purple red black white orange You are a very sensitive person and you try hard (perhaps a little too hard) to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers. But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged. Stop trying so hard. You are very talented, imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it 'on your own'. In preference you would like to team up with someone, someone with similar attributes as your own, to explore - to seek out and go perhaps 'where no other man has trod before'. It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure. Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn. So it would appear that you are 'holding back', re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being. You are holding back. You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all. The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own. Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'. This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome. You feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority. You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done. In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'. You need to be respected as an exceptional individual. This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve. You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you abide by them. 't date or hook yourself up with a hussy. Just remember, no woman deserves you and they should all thank their lucky stars that you even ackknowledge them. ",candidate00003

Balancing Agreement K# 31905 (OBAD) This is a balancing agreement for Bethlehem on the 200 leg in Zone 5, probably meter #20816. This balancing agreement should have been cashed out every month. She wouldn't tell me the current balance. ENA had a term sale to EES (sitara #1003036). The volume was 1,200 dth per day in Tenn Zone 5 and the name of the point was Bethlehem Sales. The term of the sale matches the term of the capacity release from Boston Gas.

799,00689,candidate00003," Recommendation for ENA Pools 1st choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01, no cash flow and everything is pre-petition. 2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow 3rd choice Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved. I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck. Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone. When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel. I have not done that. I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01. Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following. 1. Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket. 2. ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition. 3. The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool. Items to consider If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers. Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated. I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances. The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process. Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer. Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance. On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance. Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity. I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01. 3/5/02 Per Coen at Dominion ENA Pool Balances as of 11/30/01 12/31/01 Gath North 1,323 2,187 Tran North 0 0 Gath South (26,482) 31,583 Tran South 5,412 8,143 Cumulative (19,747) 41,913 Dominion IF Prices Mar 2002 $2.59 Feb 2002 $2.20 Jan 2002 $2.79 Dec 2001 $2.42 Nov 2001 $3.37 Oct 2001 $2.02 Sep 2001 $2.42 ",candidate00003

Incidentally I was standing directly in front of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell broke loose. I took about three steps back and wandered towards the kitchen in search of a fire extinguisher. Didn't find one, and like (the intern) was a bit disappointed in my reactions...ah well. I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit. So I am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose. It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morning. I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs. So, I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill. Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something. The next thing you know, straight out of a FOX tv show or ""You've Gotta See This"" episode...this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago. The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to ten feet in height. The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, or anything. Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmore's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree. A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady. The old woman is yelling ,""Somebody get me outta here!""...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze. Who is this masked man, I have no clue. However, I do witness from middle marketing doing his best Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up. The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens. The alarm in our building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area. So, the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital. Who knows what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in flames someday. Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted about 20 minutes writing this drama. Take care, Enjoyable or what?

828,00027,candidate00004," Group, We have had some issues with EpmiCalPool deals recently and I wanted to provide information for newer members of the group and a quick reminder for crusty veterans as we head into the Thanksgiving Holiday. I have also decided to change our protocol for entering multiple EpmiCalPool deals. Please pay special attention to #5 below. So, some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals. 1. EpmiCalPool deals are BUY-RESALE deals--(a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method) 2. We only BUY from the EpmiCalPool-no exceptions-. 3. EpmiCalPool deals have a $0 price in the buy and sell portions. Please do not enter a price on an EpmiCalPool deal. 4. EpmiCalPool deals must have a delivery point of an CISO tie point or an CISO congestion zone. Good delivery points would be: Malin, COB N/S, COB S/N, NOB N/S, NOB S/N, Cascade, Captain , Summit, Four Corners 345, Mead 230, Paloverde, NP-15, ZP-26, SP-15. Bad delivery points would include: Mid-C, Hotsprings, Hidalgo, BC Border. 5. IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BUSINESS PRACTICE HERE EpmiCalPool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the California ISO. a.) If you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example Malin to Four Corners for congestion management--than an EpmiCalPool deal from Malin to Four Corners would be appropriate. For seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will NOT be putting in deals from Malin to NP-15, NP-15 to SP-15, and SP-15 to Four Corners. b.)However, from Congestion zone to congestion zone inside of California, or if you are moving tie point to a congestion zone--for example Malin to SP-15 we will need a Malin to NP-15 and NP-15 to SP-15. This will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in California, and will prepare us for the move to FSP. 6. We will initiate this change in business practice HE 1 on Tuesday November 20th. Epmicalpool deals continue to provide problems with reports. Please see me with any questions.

835,00034,candidate00004," , take a quick look at this would you? Group, Going forward we will be transacting with Canada Corp on an over-the-counter basis. We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for buying from or selling to them non-firm energy. Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possiblities for export and import. We should be familiar with the Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD. The lead or NW trader will provide Canada with their estimate or feel of the market. Canada will be trying nearly every hour to obtain non-firm transmission. If this is an unwise practive from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, WE need to tell them, as they are losing $6.40 per mw CDD on unused tranny with zero chance for return. Further, Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border. If we cannot use their energy they have asked to be able to contact WWP, IPC or TransAlta after giving us first look to attempt to recoup some of their loss. I do not see a need for this and think there is potential for embarrassment and damage to customer relations. If we are in contact with Canada before hand (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy. Be very clear in your dealings with the NW counterparty that the energy is non-firm. Determine a book-out price if necessary to solve problems with physical flow. We are basically buying a put or a call. Finally, I would like to see the communication with Canada improve. Personal experience and observation has us not communicating with them as closely as possible and typically only speaking with their real-time group at the bottom. I feel we can do better. I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both Canada and North America. This is counterproductive for both of us for obvious reasons. Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with Canada. This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that should only be beneficial. If you have questions or ideas regarding the relationship with Canada please let me know.

853,00052,candidate00004," Check this out...you should read Liar's Poker by , and Den of Thieves. Good stuff. He notes that management lacked an 'honor among thieves,' but predicts that alumni will flourish. I suspect he is working on the book right now.---sch Is the New Drexel? By , the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.'' Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. The boss, Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. Alumni Flourish True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and 's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Energy Corp. Well before Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. But the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. Different Motivations created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was. Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked. What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits. What hid was the sneaky way it made its losses. (This is something I still don't understand, and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain, as seems intent on explaining nothing. The off-the-books partnerships that brought down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines, Indian power plants and the like. Why did , which made its money as an intermediary, invest in this stuff in the first place?) The speed with which the markets have punished reflects the differences between it and Drexel. In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business. In 's case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense. In Drexel's case, the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story. In 's, the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top. Anything is possible. ",candidate00004

I hope you don't mind. Anyway I am still living in Portland but I am no longer practicing metallurgical engineering. I began trading power about a year and a half ago for . I now manage the west hourly power trading group. The job is great, very challenging and everchanging, though I don't believe my company is too popular down your way right now (you are in San , right?)... My job consumes my time, but I am still playing soccer and still riding that same loud red motorcycle around when I have a chance. I just bought my first home, its a condominium downtown next to the Portland Museum. The place is definitely small but has a lot of character. It was an old hotel, originally built in 1926, that has just been gutted and refurbished. It is about eight blocks from my office at the World Trade Center, so walking to work in the mornings is great. The city is still asleep and eerily quiet in the morning twilight when I walk to work. The walk helps wake me up and gets me prepared for the morning rush on the trading floor. So, if you have a chance drop me a line and let me know how you are. This email address of mine works (though everything on it is subject to subpoena by the good state of California), or you can give me a call at 503-887-3449.

919,00118,candidate00004," Group, Cuts are on the way. While most can be zeroed out in Enpower (for LD's) like normal, longterm contracts will require an annuity for the value of the cut on that particular day. In the interest of being uniform, the guidelines for cuts are below. We will be handling cuts in the following manner: 1. Documentation is priority #1. We need to fill out a cut sheet with the times, the name of the person who called, the tag number, the quantity and price. 2. After attempting to resupply the cut or find an alternate sink we need to carefully document changes in the new enpower workspace. 3. We need to zero out all cut deals in Enpower, we then need to calculate the value of the deals and make an annuity. The annuity must be made HE 1 on the following day of the schedule. The annuity needs to be for 1 mw for the value of the zeroed out contract. In the comment section of the annuity you must include the Enpower deal # of the cut deal and should include an indication of the number of mws each hour and the contract price--for example (4 hours @ 25 mws X $100 per mw = $10,000). 4. Please be as accurate as possible. We still need to be flat in Enpower at the end of each day. And we still need to calculate our daily position. 5.

933,00132,candidate00004," Keoni, Here are the details on our sale to CERS for HE 14 at Palo Verde devers. I spoke with Linus at CERS at approximately 11:50--At that time I sold him 90 mws at $29 delivered at PV for HE 14, I told him the energy was coming from the CAISO. I then called at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus. For HE 13 I had sold 75 mws. I told him the schedule would be going to a zero for HE 14. I called the CAISO to notify them my export EPMI_CISO_SALSA would be going to CERS at PV devers and not SRP. I began speaking with Bhavin at the Palo Verde desk at 12:20 regarding scheduling of the energy to CERS at PV devers. I told Bhavin the export -EPMI_CISO_SALSA- would be going to CERS and that it was effectively a net schedule(90 mws out at PV devers/90 mws in at PV devers).Bhavin asked that I call a counterparty with a control area interest at PV and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area. I acknowledged this request and called El Paso Electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them. I was not comfortable with this step as I viewed it as unnecessary and told EPE I would call them back. I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them. At approximately 12:40 I discussed the 90 mw net schedule with SRP transmission. SRP control said a net schedule would show as zero. I then spoke with EPE and told them to forget the schedule. I called Bhavin back and told him SRP was aware of the schedule. Bhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled. At 13:02 Bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with SRP at PV devers. I called SRP transmission and went over the schedule one more time. SRP transmission still showed the 75 mw schedule from HE 13. I told SRP transmission that the 75 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him. He told me he would call his marketer. While transacting for HE 15, I again spoke with at SRP marketing and told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 75 mw schedule. I believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on SRP's end. It should be noted that Bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him. I think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important. My feeling is that the CAISO schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the CAISO. Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice. If you have any questions for me please let me know. Thank you for your help. ",candidate00004

960,00159,candidate00004," Group- Brace yourselves... Once more we are experiencing seasonal changes. The time zone change has pushed the evening peak back to HE 18 through HE 19. These hours are now premium, the load curve no longer resembles a rolling hill but has an extreme morning ramp and an extreme evening ramp. Both EPE and the CAISO in NP-15 will have difficulty with this evening ramp. Do not count on the EPE load forecast to accurately identify the evening ramp. We should not suck off the grid. Pay the extra $3 for firm or unit contingent power in the SW. We need to attack the evening peak early and make sure we cover it. We should be using congestion wheels as hedges. A 200 mw import requires a 200 mw wheel going in the opposite direction at $0.10--or less--we should not do 50 mws at $50 as we would still have to pay $50 on the other 150 mws if we get awarded all 50 mws of relief. We will discuss this in our meeting next Tuesday November 6th at 4:30. Let's be sharp and not give away hard-earned revenue on congestion mis-management or poor scheduling. Any questions? Comments? Ideas? Bring them to the meeting on next Tuesday. Thanks, ",candidate00004

Certainly the ability to go long or short into R/T will be important and hopefully the CISO will follow through on its efforts to ""strive for simplicity and transparency."" Any idea what the penalties for being long or short in R/T might be? In the CISO's proposal the first two ""goals"" for the real time market appear to be at odds with each other.

995,00194,candidate00004," Group, We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter months. First: With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp. We will have to carefully manage the units to prevent ""swinging"" them and increasing the chance of a unit outage. As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the unit commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-line and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back. Recently we have sold energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual (Newman 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensively in the market. Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they have a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their marketing group. We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going forward, but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be matched either in-house or by other marketers. I look to each member of the group to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as efficiently as possible. Second: The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest. It will become very difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10. We should look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC. Also, as lights and heaters come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 through HE 20. Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours. Be sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in with ECC. Finally: We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(the first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews and the final two months of the year.

I have attached my responses to the self-evaluation form. My accomplishments and more long-winded descriptions of what I do are in the attachment, by comparison my near-term goals for the next 6 months are pretty concise. 1. Continue to maximize the abilities of the group, and try to leave nothing on the table. 2. Minimize our settlements and disputes over Enpower mistakes, or other avoidable actions. 3. Continue to provide those in the group opportunities to improve themselves and get where they want to go in . 4. Stay ahead of California with regards to political, legal and credit risk. 5. Work with middle-marketing and services groups to develop new opportunities. 6. Improve my education through SQL training and more advanced Derivatives training to better allow me to understand the fundamentals of the market and the movements of spreads relative to market fundamentals. I greatly enjoy my current position and look forward to the next 6 months. If you have any questions just let me know. Thanks, ",candidate00004

1019,00218,candidate00004," , you're doing well and continuing to enjoy Newport...My friend lives down there in Huntington Beach (watch out for him!), he moved down there about 3 months ago. I have been planning on visiting him for a while. I wouldn't mind getting your perspective on the city as well when I come down. Last time I was in LA, I spent a fair amount of time on the Strip and around Hollywood before heading home. Another guy I know down there works at the House of Blues and got me tickets to Taj Mahal-- Segal came out and played guitar with them at the end (the guy was NOT good)--which was nice. Also, one of my neighbors from college works on the Maury Povich show (I think). So, I definitely need to go down there for a visit. I will be in Sacramento towards the end of July (16th thru 18th) and then am planning to get down to LA right at the start of August for work and perhaps a bit of goofing off. So whatever, if I make it down there it should be a decent time. Sorry to hear about the possible cancelation of the trip to Portland, hope you can make it (though the deck seems stacked against you this time around). I will plan for you to be here (so you wouldn't be stuck in a hotel), but don't worry if you can't get here on the 3rd. Plenty of time for that, as the sun should be out for a while (til October anyway). I was knocking around going snowboarding up at Timberline on Saturday (get a few runs in before 10), but I am leaning towards a trip around Mt. St. Helens on my bike instead. It's supposed to be around 80 and sunny here on Saturday and you can't pass such weekends up. St. Helens should be gorgeous and since we are in the middle of a drought in the Northwest I want to check out the level of the resevoirs up in the mountains. We'll see though, either way I will be getting up early to catch the sunrise in the mountains. So work was solid today, got just about everything accomplished that I wanted to. No one brought me lunch after working the night shift...but what can you do? Anyway, hope the funeral goes well (you know...as it can), and keep me posted on when/if you might get up to Portland. Oh. And as for a picture, I'll see what I can do. 's got a couple, but I don't have any that I can pop on the web right now and send down to you. I admit, I have been called an Ogre before (I am a bit of a taller, bigger fellow on the soccer field--and some forwards have unresolved issues concerning it), but...well... should be able to fill you in.

1022,00221,candidate00004," , I wanted to check with you quickly regarding taking a month-long position in August. I would like to buy a piece of NP, sell a piece of SP, and sell PV. I believe that value exists in taking these positions into the real-time market throughout August. NP and SP are currently trading near flat. I think the potential for real-time congestion revenue(RT has seen approximately $250,000 so far this month) across constrained paths in California makes this a low risk way to generate value in a low liquidity market. I have discussed a month long short at PV with . While I recognize the rest of the desk has a position, I think RT can generate good value liquidating in the shoulder hours beyond what could be generated by just filling dailies because of the current price levels. This also represents a relatively low risk trade (under $10 downside). I also would like to use these positions as a basis in hourly EOL trading as well. If you have concerns or questions please let me know, otherwise I will put these positions on over the next week. Thanks, ",candidate00004

1058,00257,candidate00004," Due to the relatively weak real-time market during morning hours, we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec. bidding or buying-back generation that you've sold forward. We want to stress that this is a relatively short-term strategy. As the weather turns cold during the late- and Winter months, the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the real-time market. Lately, HE1-10 have been very weak real-time, ranging between $25 and $40. We have two strategies that we would like to suggest: Group, We have two important items regarding the services and asset management side of our business. First, The CAISO has been calling repeatedly regarding outages. We will continue to call the CAISO for every outage (including when Black Hills goes down 200 kWh). has worked closely with the CAISO regarding their new tariff and her information appears below. It is very important that we do not expose ourselves to charges by not notifying the CAISO of an outage. Second, We will be working with the generators to execute buy-backs or supplemental dec. bids when market conditions warrant. has written an email to the generators also detailed below. and will be contacting the generators over the next few days to review this email with them. Afterwards the Real-Time group will contact the generators and initiate one of the two strategies when profitable. Real-Time will retain 50% of the profits over the generator's day ahead profits. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback. Thanks, __________________________________________________________________________ I have reviewed documents from the ISO's website regarding forced outages as they relate to the June 19 FERC order and concluded the following: (1) During a System Emergency, a penalty based on twice the highest price paid for energy in the hour could be assessed if the Participating Generator does not notify the ISO of the outage within the operating hour of the outage, and (2) During a Non-System Emergency, a generator could be assessed a penalty if it fails to report the forced outage within the operating hour. If you have any questions at all, I can be reached at extension 7733. Thanks, __________________________________________________________________________ 1. Decremental Supplemental Bids We can submit dec. bids to the ISO at a price below your cost to generate. Basically, we would be letting the ISO know that we're willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mw's from the ISO to cover the prescheduled quantity. You are still paid the day-ahead price for the day-ahead quantity, but instead of generating it, you would be buying it from the ISO. For example, if your cost to generate is $40, and you sell day-ahead for $50, you make $10/MWh. If the ISO takes the decremental bid, and the price is $30, then you make $20/MWh. Advantages - A relatively large upside, the price the ISO charges could actually go negative, as large as negative $91.87. Also, you would actually be buying from the ISO, as opposed to selling to the ISO and being subject to credit risk. Disadvantages - Ten minute dispatch. When we submit decremental bids, the ISO has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every 10 minutes. In addition to the physical problems this might create, the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow. 2. Buying-Back Blocks in the Bi-Lateral Market: This strategy calls for our real-time traders to buy blocks of energy in the bi-lateral market for below your cost to generate. This would call for you to reduce your generation, and the energy we buy-back in the real-time market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity. Once again, you are still paid the day-ahead price for the day-ahead quantity, but instead of generating it, you would be buying it at the price paid to buy-back the energy. As in the previous example, if your cost to generate is $40, and you sell day-ahead for $50, you make $10/MWh. If we can buy-back the energy for a price of $30, then you make $20/MWh. Additionally, if we do buy-back the energy, we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the ISO to remain compliant with the FERC order. Then, if the ISO takes the incremental bid, you can generate the power and sell for additional profit. Advantages - No 10 minute dispatch (unless a supplemental bid is accepted). You would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced. Also, the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage. Disadvantage - Not as large of an up-side as decremental bidding. At this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy #2, buying-back blocks of energy in the bi-lateral market. Once you and our real-time traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy, then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the ISO. We propose a 50/50 profit split, above your day-ahead profit, earned from either of these two strategies. If you have any questions or comments please call myself or . Cocke ",candidate00004

1068,00267,candidate00004," , This is from a guy on our floor. He's a summer intern...and this is his Tuesday morning story. Incidentally I was standing directly in front of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell broke loose. I took about three steps back and wandered towards the kitchen in search of a fire extinguisher. Didn't find one, and like (the intern) was a bit disappointed in my reactions...ah well. I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit. So I am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose. It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morning. I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs. So, I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill. Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something. The next thing you know, straight out of a FOX tv show or ""You've Gotta See This"" episode...this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago. The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to ten feet in height. The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, or anything. Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmore's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree. A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady. The old woman is yelling ,""Somebody get me outta here!""...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze. Who is this masked man, I have no clue. However, I do witness from middle marketing doing his best Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up. The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens. The alarm in our building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area. So, the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital. Who knows what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in flames someday. Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted about 20 minutes writing this drama. Take care, you liked the show last night. Take it easy. B ",candidate00004

You're right, sometimes introductions sound more like the presentation of a resume than a letter...but I think you pulled it off. I was able to close on my condo last weekend. It was a tremendous pain with a bit of the last minute run-around, but I finally got moved in on Friday night. I don't know about my neighbors yet as I am the only one moved in on my floor so far. The seller is still finishing the renovation of the place...they are converting it from an old hotel. My condo is about 8 blocks from my office downtown, so it was great to roll out of bed this morning and be able to walk to work. Like you, I am not sure what might have told you about me...so here goes. I was born on the east coast (Connecticut), moved around for a while, and eventually was towed out to southwest Washington by my parents. I went to highschool in Kelso (this is where I met and then graduated with ). Then went to college at University of Washington in Seattle. College was good, if a bit long. I received a degree in Metallurgical engineering and worked as an engineer in Portland for a year doing failure and corrosion analysis (whoa!). A bit less than 2 years ago I started working with as a trader, trading hourly electricity in the West. I started out on shift, but now manage the group and get to work a more normal schedule (usually 10-12 hours a day) during the week. I enjoy the job a ton, the market changes nearly every day and it beats the hell out of staring at a scanning electron microscope for 4 hours at a pop. With regards to your visit. I've been in Portland for a few years now, so I should be able to provide a fairly good guide service around the town. Depending on when you get here and how things go, we'll have to see if we can get you outside the city to some of the Mountains and the Coast. Astoria is about 2 hours away and it's a pretty scenic drive out there (especially if you're from New Mexico). If the weather's nice we might be able to check out some of the resevoirs and rivers around Mt. St. Helens and the gorge...good swimming, hiking etc. It should be a blast. Have you gotten any closer to firming up when you will be in town? I am pretty open at the start of July, and although it always rains on the 4th (EVERY single year), that's still a good time to be coming up. Besides, if you ever thought about moving here, you have to understand why its so green... It was good to hear from you, and if you have any questions you can give me a call at 503-887-3449. Take care. ",candidate00004

1085,00284,candidate00004," Group, I received a call from McReynold at the BPA today. was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing. explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by Grays Harbor and Frontier EVERY hour. The group at BPA cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information. I am meeting with on Tuesday. is inclined to recommend to BPA that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance. Such a recommendation would severely limit 's ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers. I believe that we can provide 's group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading. Therefore: We must call Grays Harbor and Frontier at the top of EVERY hour. Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated, not an estimate. Finally, sign off the hour in the services book. has provided us with the needed information for each day. Reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in, than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the BPA marketers.

It should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled, and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered.

Gas Control Issues: Nominations: Their could be nominations every day for flow from El Paso and TW depending on the price and transportation agreements between and PPL. You will see a total nom for the TW side in your daily orders and the El Paso order will have to come from the TW logistics Team. Flows: We may have to batch the El Paso volumes depending on the nominations. We will watch the noms this week to get a feel of where and how much they may vary. As agents for Citizens under the EMAR umbrella, We will need to get with the El Paso controller and let them know that your going to open their side to be Primary and start taking flow from them to accumulate the order.(If this looks like it is going to be small volumes we may need to batch the gas and work with El Paso Controllers.) Currently at the Griffith Power Plant TW and El Paso screens the primary control set point is 1 (TW primary) When you need to flow from El Paso you will need to switch the service to 2 (El Paso primary), and flow the gas until accumed and switch back to 1 (TW primary). If anyone has a question on this please call me and we can walk through it. Again as EMAR we are to make the changes at the Site from Gas Control.

1532,00080,candidate00008," When doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid. We allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS. When allocating points or groups that have not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation. . Example : Allocations are as follows The only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue Timely: M/L Thoreau West System 1093.000 (capacity) I/B Link 700.000 (capacity) Laplata/ 500.000 (capacity) Socal Needles 775.000 (Window) Evening: Same sequence Non-Grid: Same sequence ID-1or ID-2: Same sequence shows up to be allocated. Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate. The only time we should have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously allocated. The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes. lets try this for a while and see how it is working. ",candidate00008

It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points. I had them pull moisture readings and they were well below TW's #7 of water. They said it was more like drip. This heavies are in the gas stream that is falling out and collecting in the pipe.

They had intended to take their 24hr rate with-in 12 to 14hrs. Asked to raise the TW mainline setpoint to approximately 120,000. After speaking with off line and asked him to open the spead sheet from on their takes asked him to figure the hourly take for the 24 hrs. He said that he made a mistake and didn't look at it.

I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this. She consistently does not take messages properly. Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding. When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time. She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled. The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty. She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them. If she does it is after they have been in there for days. We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs. In summary, 's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis. She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office. ",candidate00009

He always represented the pillar of strength while still being able to to be one of the most loving and compassionate people I have ever known. To me was everything a man was supposed to be. It always made me proud to talk to about my football games and later on the oil and gas business. It was neat that in a way I was following a similiar path in life to the one that had taken. And when my daughter was born I began to see how he must of felt about his three wonderful daughters, who I still consider to be like sisters to me. I was so excited when Little was born this year because I knew how proud and excited he must have been to finally have his boy. I hope someday I have the opportunity to tell him what a special man his Grandpa was. The thing I always will remember about was that when he walked into a room, he filled it up, not because of his size, but because of his enormous personality and lust for life. He could always put a smile on your face. The world has lost a very special man. I know this is hard for you and the girls. It is hard for me to write this without breaking up.

1646,00078,candidate00009," ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder basin of Wyoming. Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin. As you may or may not know, has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998. ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin. Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site. The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks. There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market. However, they seem to have some political backing. These developers recognize that they need 's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts: 1. Power Marketing and Project development 2. Gas Supplies and Pipeline access 3. Regulatory and Transmission expertise Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further. Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative ( would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks. Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions. I don't want to make this email a novel! Thanks a lot. 303-575-6473 ",candidate00009

Between job prospects, my cold and coming to grips with some of the past i've just been a little detached from myself. I was also in the midst of a taxing conversation with ted when we were IM'ing and it was bringing back stuff too. I'm just struggling with this pattern of attaching myself to men who are ultimately either literally not available or emotionally not available. and this whole mm not contacting me has got me very conflicted....b/c to be honest, i really hope he never contacts me again...but i also feel like him not contacting implies that he believes there is something wrong with even our casual interaction (and i'm not disagreeing), which ultimately makes me feel guilty and rotten. so anyway...i think i just want something to come along that feels good..whether that be a job,a guy,a location, a massage...whatever. i'm just very disappointed with mediocrity. i feel luke warm about too many things. and the partying comment didn't make me think of us reverting...it merely made me think of mm and a past conversation we had at a point i could have maybe kept things from going too far. give me a buzz tonight when you get home...i'll probably feel tons better after a little nourishment.

Anyway, sounds like you've got some really exciting activities to look forward to over the next 6 mos to a year. Can't wait to hear all about the baby when it arrives (the first in the family is always exciting) and I know you and are going to have the best time jaunting around Europe. I wish I was planning the same kind of trip right now. As for your future beyond that, have you been to Seattle before? I'm taking a long weekend there with a friend from work and would love to hear more about things to do if you have any advice.

Not to get too sappy, but I really treasure our friendships and I'm not sure you all realize how much i depend on you guys.

I was actually looking into that program the other day, so on a selfish note I'm really curious to see what she thinks of the school, etc. I think it'd be awesome to work in D.C.

She had a heart beat when she was born, but it was very weak. They tried to resuscitate her but after about 15 minutes and told the doctors to let her go. Her name was Kelly . My Mom and 's Mom flew out to TN on Tuesday and my Dad went out there Wednesday...they are managing, but it's been really tough. is fine health-wise which we are all very thankful for, but everyone is really just trying to come to grips with why this happened.

1784,00119,candidate00010," I am genuinely flattered that you are asking for my reading recommendations (not to mention being associated in any way, shape or form with - How is by the way?) Truth be told, however, of late much of my reading material has been natural gas related and although the industry is riveting, I'm not sure that is exactly the kind of entertainment you had in mind. However, I did read a book a few months ago that you might find rather interesting. The title is The Professor and the Madman : A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary. I know it may sound a little dry at first glance, but I actually found it extremely interesting. If you go to Amazon.com there are reviews on all of the books I've included here. There are also a couple of other books I'm in the process of reading right now: Galileo's Daughter : A Historical Memoir of Science, , and Love and of Aquitaine : A Life. The Galileo book is a little slow to start, but has tons of interesting historical references, as does of Aquitaine. If I remember correctly, you always had a bit of a fondness for history. I also read Memoirs of a Geisha last fall and couldn't put it down, although I have talked to others who didn't find it as enjoyable. Personally, I was completely intrigued by the time period and uniqueness of Eastern culture, and the author was meticulous when it came to research for the book. this helps you out a bit. As for the ""Peacers"" comment...Definitely think we are tested, but I think the tests are there to force us to recognize our own strength and endurance. Contrary to God not knowing anything about us, I'm convinced he knows everything about us and has the unique ability to know when we've lost sight of our talents, character and/or zest for life. It is at these moments life seems to hand us the upsets right? But, in dealing with the upsets we come to a better understanding of who we are and what we have to offer the world (or on a much smaller scale, what we have to offer the people around us for whom we care the most). Sorry, I know I'm getting excessively deep, but I've been doing a heck of a lot of thinking lately - and much of it at church. Disappointed you won't be able to join the gang in over the fourth, but we'll be sure to raise our glasses in a toast to you. And, I'll keep looking for you name on the Field scoreboard.

I think I'm really going to look for housing on this trip. Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday. Talk to you soon, ",candidate00010

I basically rotated from my bed to the couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed. Pitiful but much needed. Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me. Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday. You can either call or email if you have any questions for me. And, I'll decide where I'd like to go for the long weekend. I may pick two and just let you two decide the final destination. ",candidate00010

So...the reception is supposed to start at 7:00 and go until 9:00 and I figured we could either go to an early dinner, or cut out of the reception a little bit early and go to dinner afterward (say around 8:00 - 8:30). Of course, dinner doesn't have to factor in at all if we don't want it to...just a suggestion. I'll give you call later tonight to hammer out the details. See ya, ",candidate00010

Glad to hear everyone seems to be doing okay, with the exception of who appears to be suffering from a severe case of spring fever. , went to an Astros game a couple weeks ago and saw your name on the scoreboard...it made me feel special. The trader I work with, who was there with me, is a huge baseball fan and upon hearing I went to school with you has insisted upon checking your stats regularly...seems you're not doing to shabby. Congrats. Life for me is pretty good, although I'm in desperate need of a deep, drunken conversation regarding life and all it's complexities (I expect everyone to contribute to said discussion when we convene).

Anyway, got an email from this morning and she said another trip should be planned to go over in Sept/Oct when the airfares are dirt cheap. I'm guessing I'll probably be up for going again by that time if you don't mind waiting that long. My guess is we could get tickets for somewhere around $350 or $400. I think I found a flight for June (probably the 5th - 12th), but I'm going to end up spending somewhere around $600. Let me know what you think. ",candidate00010

Probably not, I know there are only a few flights out a day, but if I could get into closer to late afternoon on Sunday it would be a better for me.

One of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers. I hope you're still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago. It looks like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing for you. I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a research trip for me). If you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

It seems to me that it would be preferable to fly in Thursday evening, therefore freeing myself up to come in Friday at whatever time of day best suits yourself and the rest of the group. If no one minds, it might even be nice to see some of the activity on the desk during cash trading. Also, I anticipate staying through the weekend to see a bit more of the city and surrounding areas, but plan to cover those expenses myself.

Not only did I go to the Menil collection by myself (can you imagine?)...I also went to berryhill and ate dinner solo. When I got back to the apartment she said I should've called and she would've met me for eats. My immediate response, ""Actually, I needed some solo time."" Subject closed. As for the lease, brought up the subject and it went pretty much no where. Discovered we could sign a year lease and if she decides to up and go I can move into a one bedroom if I give the complex 30 days notice...which is what I'm figuring we'll end up doing. I also told her that I got my airplane ticket through council travel on British Airways leaving the 5th and returning the 12th (via email yesterday) and she didn't mention it last night. Who knows?

In regards to trading, I am absolutely loving it. I've been on EOL for a little over a month now (although my trades go into one of the other trader's books for the time being...I should get my own in a couple months) and am really enjoying the new life/perks this job allows. Case in point, took my Mom to see 's last game with the Rockets on one of the brokers (center court seats...she was thrilled) and am off to Vegas this weekend to ""meet"" with some of the power traders from Portland. So much for the 16-18 hour days I was dealing with for a year or so there...given present circumstances it was all worth it. No need to ""let me of the hook"" for my candor last night, I meant everything I said and I wanted you to hear those things. In a quest to be an oh so witty smart-ass, sometimes I forget to just tell people what I think/feel...always catches up to me in hind-sight and if the opportunity presents itself for me to rectify that then I don't believe in passing it up. Contrary to what you may think, I'm a big girl who thinks for herself and always acts on her own volition.

Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion: I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie. On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Springs piece). The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday. Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.

It reminded me of London quite a bit, although I think the weather is milder. I was actually checking out apartment sites the other day b/c I was that impressed with the place.

We went out to dinner in Nashville both Friday and Saturday night, and spent the day walking around downtown on Saturday. drove me around the Army base and showed me a bit of the area where they live. We also went to this Botanical Garden/Museum called Cheekwood...it's the estate of the Coffee fortune. Anyway, it was fun and very relaxing. They're house is really cute and their neighborhood requires at least a 1/3 an acre for each house...so there's lots of land. I haven't made a decision about the Seattle job yet, I actually have until the end of next week to give them my answer. In the meantime I've been talking to some headhunters and checking out any other options that may be out there. At this point there is really no telling where in the U.S. I'm ultimately going to end up...which I personally find kind of fun. We got a total of $350 out of the $400 deposit back (not too bad).

If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule, I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale. I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from for the short generation. Basically, you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20. The benefit in this swap would be: hedge against floating price lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule - $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point, however, I used this in the analysis. Please let me know what you think. will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers.

I will make sure that we receive balanced books from Day ahead trading/scheduling. Also, make an effort to know why we run reports, etc. so that you can make suggestions to streamline this operation. I will provide more documented general procedures and will spend time with each of you on how to handle cuts in Enpower and Lotus Notes. We have a good group and we will do well in the new market. However, this will take an extra effort from each of us. If you have questions about any of the expectations, ask. That is why we make the list. Thanks, ",candidate00011
2045,00045,candidate00011," , We have a question related to the acquisition of ancillary services; Ercot publishes their various A/S requirements on a daily basis. We have noticed that you dont procure up to the amount that you say that you require. For example, on 9/27, Ercot published that the System Requirements are 1,800 mw for Regup. Ercot procured only approx. 117 mw's each hour. The same thing occurs for REGDN and Responsive. Is Ercot satisfying their reserve requirement needs with OOM and Upbalancing, etc.? I will be out of the office next week, so can you reply to -Smith? His e-mail is doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com. Otherwise, he can be reached at 713-853-9310. Thanks for your help! ",candidate00011

He lives in a rural area and his cell phone doesnt always work. In these instances, we tried to contact the plant to instruct them to increase/decrease generation. They have refused in the past, as they were only to receive instruction from Jerry. The plant should now be aware that this communication problem can exist and will be receptive to making generation changes per our instructions. ",candidate00011

2048,00048,candidate00011," We are required to input down balancing bids for all generators that we represent. Every morning it is especially important that we have a DBES bid input for Frontera. We should have balancing bids in for all hours, but we are most likely to be deployed in the morning hours. We are required to monitor the Deployment instructions and communicate any instructions to Jerry Watson @ Teco/Frontera. Frontera is willing to pay a max of $10 to decrease their gen. This bid tells Ercot that we are willing to pay up to $10 for Ercot to fill our schedule during the time that we are being ""balanced down."" We should never see prices below $10 without being deployed down. If this situation happens, we have to explain to Frontera why we didnt get selected by the ISO. This is an important part of the Services side of our business, and is the only way that we get paid on these type transactions.

Also, I asked him about the oil light and he seemed to think that the oil sensor needed replacing. The Porsche certainly requires more attention than most cars, the clutch being a common and costly repair. The exterior of the car is in fair condition. Maybe a detail shop could tell me whether some of the scratches could be buffed out. I'm not sure if you have checked into painting while you had the car, but you cant get it done inexpensively. I am still interested in the car and I would like my wife to be able to take a look at it. However, I am leaving town tomorrow and wont be back until Sunday. Maybe we can meet then. If our discussions progress and you havent already sold or traded in the car, I would like to have it checked out mechanically (at my cost) and would like a detail shop to give me an assessment of what they could do with the finish.

2069,00069,candidate00011," Thanks for listening on last week's phone call. I have been asked to help -Smith get Ercot off of the ground as far as Services and Hourly trading is concerned. If you have not heard, the Entergy and TVA cash trading positions will now be manned by one trader who will also trade the term markets. This will give the traders the leverage needed to create value in these respective regions. My inexperience in the term is the reason given for my implied demotion, although these moves opened up cash trading opportunities for other players. This had been the first month that I've had access to the prompt month and I am up nearly $500k; there is no doubt in my mind that I was going to beat this region into a profitable proposition. I have notified Presto that I would be joining in Ercot, but would be considering other options in , or even Portland. I mentioned that I might call you and he has no problem with that. The job in may be a good opportunity, however, the environment here is not compatible with my personal and professional goals. I am looking for other opportunities, preferably within the company. If there are areas that you think might be a good match for my skill set, let me know - I would appreciate your consideration or suggestions.

Three units in total, however, the steamer cannot operate independently of the ct's. I say this because the Ercot protocols allow dispatching each of these units independently and Ercot exercises this right while punishing us financially for non compliance. There is no way under the Resource Plan from the protocols to express which combinations must be considered. These units are behind a common point, so the rules as they were written dont consider us. I know that this is more than you asked for, but for whatever it's worth........ Thanks and give me a call if you need more info, Ercot Region ",candidate00011

This is great, however, warned me that we were outside of the tariff because Ercot still maintains that OOMC means run. He relayed that in the event of line meltdown, etc. we would be liable. Adams also said this last night. We are officially on notice of potential QSE liability. In my opinion we need to: Call Saathoff and see if he can resolve their confusion today, otherwise we need to file whatever is necessary, under the protocols, to protest this ridiculous interpretation and to protect ourself from this ""liability.""

2112,00112,candidate00011," - How is business? Things not as fun here as PDX. I am still in the market for a car and I have a strong candidate: 1990 Carrera 2 cabriolet. It has 64k and the interior is flawless. The exterior has a couple of dings and some rock chips, etc in the front. The paint has some waterspots on the hood as well. The guy that owns it is a geek and never has waxed the car. It may be possible to get these out by a detail shop. Heres the kicker: the guy is asking $27,500 negotiable. I think I can get this for $24,500 or 25k. It needs tires and one of the headlight lenses has a rock chip. The car drives great. Do you know of anything that I need to look out for with this particular model? The engine is a 3.6 litre and it runs great. Can a detail shop get out smudges and waterspots? The blue book trade in on this vehicle in good condition is $24,000. The retail is supposedly $33k. What am I missing here? Thanks, ",candidate00011

I currently do several things: I am the Manager of the real time Power Trading desk. I also manage the Ercot Asset book. I trade around a combined cycle gas plant in south Texas. I am required to trade gas along with the power in order to properly hedge the plant. I would be interested in continuing in this area. Thanks for anything you can tell me about working at Anadarko. I could send my resume, but if we dont have paralell needs, then I wont bother. I have some other things that I am working on. Thanks again for asking. This company will be fine, but I have worked 12-14 hours/day for 8+ years. When the stock price is $90, I can somewhat justify the hours and lack of life. However, although I am sure that will bounce back, I am no longer willing to sacrifice to make it so. I have been consistenly profitable in my time here.

2120,00120,candidate00011," Yesterday the Frontera plant was idle due to economics. We had submitted a Resource Plan (this indicates to Ercot what we plan to generate) with zero mw's and zero premium because the unit was offline. In the Resource Plan, we can attach a premium for OOM up or down. In the plan for yesterday we indicated that our unit was ""unavailable and offline"". The plant personel are responsible for submitting an outage schedule with Ercot - this cannot be completed by the QSE. Ercot called yesterday and asked if we could start the unit if they needed us to. We called Jerry Watson (with Frontera) and he relayed that this was possible. Ercot immediately OOM'd us up 135 mw's, beginning hour ending 13, to control congestion. They later upped this to 185 mw's for the remainder of the day, through 2400. I called Patterson, who is our Ercot Rep., and I explained the situation. I wished to know how they could OOM us if we were offline. I also wanted to know how this would settle. His reply is as follows: Since we indicated verbally that we could run the plant, that changed our status from unavailable to available. Since we had an implied low premium (zero) on our plant, we were high in the OOM stack and were called upon. We would receive only the mcp for our power because we had no premium indicated. The mcp was low all day ( mid teens) yesterday. If we had been OOM'd up and could not recover our startup & gen costs, we could dispute the bill and provide sufficient documentation to recover, at most, our costs. We immediately revised our Resource Plan and indicated 185 mw's available with a $50 premium. This invoked the Protocol provisions requiring them to pay us the 18 heat rate times gas costs. The Protocol section dealing with OOM up payments is found under section 6.8.2.2. Please review this to understand why this applies. This was a very educational process. We think that in revising our Resource Plan ""on the fly"" we were able to turn a bad situation into a profitable day for Frontera. Until further notice, the following policy should be implemented: If Frontera is offline and Ercot calls to ask about the availability. Say the unit is NOT available. If Frontera is scheduled to run, need to input into the Resource Plan the following premiums: $50 premium for OOM up. $10 premium for OOM down. These premiums will be added to the mcp and will be used to determine our place in the merit order. If we are OOM'd up, the premium will require that the heat rate formula is invoked. If we are OOM'd down, then we should be paid the mcp + premium. Please call me if you have questions, J. Forney Director, Ercot Region 713-853-7160 ",candidate00011

Ercot has asked us to file a dispute for each time that we were issued an OOMC. I think that this goes back to Sept 14th. Also at issue is the payment for the actual power once it is called for. Ercot claims that OOMC means run, instead of standby. So, for the times that we were asked to run, Ercot will only pay us the balancing energy price, versus the OOME heat rate calculation. How far can we go back in a dispute? I thought we were somewhat limited. ",candidate00011
2127,00127,candidate00011," , I have elected to stay in until at least February. It is so late in the year, that I may not be immediately effective in the West and I would have ""lost"" the first part of this year, as I was training (myself). There is a huge need for me here and I am trying to do what's right for both E and myself. To that end, has offered me an opportunity to trade around 's assets in Texas, learning the term trading side of the business from -Smith. Both and know my circumstances and their proposal gets me the experience that I need, while they get my experience in Services, training & managing a team and making money in a pool type market, as exists in Texas. These opportunities were presented to me only after I stated emphatically that I was returning to Portland. I would still like to live in Portland as early as February. I realize that a seat wont be held open for anyone, and I will revisit this issue in Feb. This compromise seems reasonable. I have asked that this be committed to writing, so I am editing what has created concerning job responsibilities. Additionally, most junior people are dissatisfied here and the bottom line reason: they dont know how their job relates to the entire floor making money. This explanation to them and an acknowledement of their contribution will bring the ideas forth from the ""back corner."" The senior traders say aloud that they dont need anyone, and they will make their money with or without help. A particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him, then he has them sent home. I think that there are three Real Timers at home at full pay right now. One or two will be paid for two years, or so I'm told. This type behavior is allowed as the trader makes a great amount of money for the company. This is not an unusual occurence on trade floors, but I will not be any part of it. I am going to spend this time to try to make some difference in this culture. If we dont get buy in from the top, I will also be at risk of going home. Some of these guys just dont get it. There are, however, many positives to staying here: the guys I report to are like-minded concerning the above. They are very competent and have a lot to teach & they are willing to teach. I am excited about learning something new and also being able to lead a team. Well, thanks for listening to my sermon, sister . My wife and I miss Portland and will probably be back next year.

After a couple of months, a coworker took me in and gave me some pointers on hedging, which is especially important in my region. The month of May was very profitable, finally, and things were coming together until.......... (Please keep this confidential) Presto called me in to tell me that I was moving to Ercot as Manager of the Real Time group, his decision being final, no negotiations. (thanks for your understanding, bunghole). I had previously turned down several attempts to bring me back to Texas in this capacity and I expressed that I was less than happy with his decision. I think that Ercot will be busy and a worthwhile region to be involved with, given that we have retail load to service, etc. However, thats not the job that I agreed to move 3000 miles for. I suspect other changes would ensue, once I established this region. So. It looks like I will be returning to Portland. We bought a new house here and are very happy with everything, except my job (which is a huge thing). I may be working West Mid Mkt SW or doing something with the Service Desk. I dont mind doing anything as long as it's productive. Anyway, I was pissed in the beginning, but I had to take time to digest this, analyze the opportunity and make an informed unemotional decision. I am too deep in the (out of the money) options to cut and run, so it now boils down to where do I want to live. There is interest outside of the company in me, but I am under contract. I miss Portland and I think about it all the time. I must be a mountain man at heart. Well, let me know if you have any thoughts on the above. Once again, I dont wish to have this get out to anyone on the West desk, just yet. I heard that you did really well on your home sale. That's awesome. Maybe I can buy back my house and my boat. (just kidding). I am actually more concerned about buying another boat than I am a house. How is your housing in Taylor? I miss the beer in PDX, boating and the winter bowling. It is freaking hot here in Texas! Anyway, keep kicking butt and keep those Texans in line! ",candidate00011

I am talking with Wolfe and , but I would like to keep things low key. I know this all seems pretty weird, but my situation has changed so drastically that I have some major, immediate decisions to make. Basically, the East Desk wants me to build a team in Real e, similar to how we did it in Portland. Unfortunately, that was not the job I agreed to take (always get it in writing - I never could). Had I known that it was a similar position to what I had, I never would have left. Anyway, Melodick wants me to consider opportunities within and I have agreed to give her a week to see if a fit exists. She is easy to work with and is being very helpful. However, I have expressed to and that my first preference would be to return to Portland. I have given this some thought and believe that taking the Real Time position would not be a good move for me, given the atmosphere here.

I spoke with B again and he is agreeable to the idea of my return. He mentioned that West has needs in Services, Middle Mkt - SW and even Structuring. I think that I would be a good fit in Mid Mkt, as I could build upon my experience and also learn as much of the structuring side as possible. Wherever I go, I am ready to make an impact. The HR department here in wants me to entertain other opportunities within and they have brought some things before me today. I had also considered staying and building the Ercot business here, as there is a huge need for leadership in this area. However, Real Time roles are very hard to shed around here and I am apprehensive about being a Commercial Director managing Real Time. I have no doubt that I could make a huge difference here, but a lot of time would have to be wasted defending the group and myself. Anyway, I wish we could sit down, have a beer and discuss, but that's probably not practical. Belden says to talk with you about the needs of the floor and get some idea where the ideal fit might be.

2185,00185,candidate00011," , I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation: Frontera has been issued OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th. This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal. The OOMC, as I understand it, reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols. The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price, which currently is zero. This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent. An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week, per Patterson. The second component of this option is OOME. This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option. The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols. So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component. I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols. Here is the problem: the head of Ercot Market Operations, Adams, interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating. When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC, they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid. We explained to them, on numerous occasions, that we dont believe OOMC means run. If they wanted us to run, then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component. I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run, yes or no. When instructed to run by Ercot, we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders. I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep, Patterson regarding this issue. I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's intrepretation was correct. For all of the times that we ran, at their request, we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc, rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance). For example, in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate. also mentioned that when they said run, they expected us to sell to someone else, or just generate into the imbalance. told me ""dont worry, you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money."" Here is my view: OOMC does not mean run. It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls, much like replacement, responsive reserve and non-spinning. Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations, a group supposedly unconcerned with price. If OOMC means to run, then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OOME? They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance. OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME. This is basically the disagreement. This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera. Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in hopes of filing for a ""breakeven."" Ridiculous. I spoke with Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had ""no comment"" on whether OOMC means to generate. Patterson now also has ""no comment."" and said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment. I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs. the imbalance price we will receive. I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant (in response to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction. This has compelled Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need to have us online to control local congestion. Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect? Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or , Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols. The latter is in effect. Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME deployment, unless we are already runnnig. I think that this is a software issue, not a protocol issue. We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled. Once we have been OOMC'd, we will start to gen. Once we reach full load, we will request an OOME. If they dont comply, we will shut down the unit. Ercot said that "" it was entirely reasonable that we would request to be compensated in the form of an OOME."" The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes. Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis? Finally, I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via OOME or force Ercot into a corner. It just is not the right economic environment to generate for $27 and sell for $5. Further, operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for ""forcing them to OOME our plant."" Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run? If you agree with me, what is our next step? I need to move aggressively on this issue. Thanks, ",candidate00011

Here are some things that we proposed to Frontera: September 20th - I suggested selling October at $24.75. This was a 10.72 heat rate. I had to take off for an trip and took over for me in trying to get them to transact. Power moved down, but so did gas, The heat rate was the same, but they still didnt want to transact as power moved down to $24.75. Power reached low of 10 heat rate for October recently - it is currently 10.2. I suggested early this week in selling balance of the week at a 10.5 heat rate. The dailies have been now liquidating as low as 8.9 hr. August (late) - proposed selling 12.7 heat rate in September . They didnt want to because they wanted to liquidate in the daily market. This didnt work out. On a daily basis, Frontera has a problem making timely decisions. For example, I give them gas prices and daily prices. They say that they would like to stay offline for the next day. I tell them that I will bookout my option. They call back later and say that they would like to run. Bids are now $2 less for my option and the prices they receive for their ramp up and onpeak schedule are horrible. On Tuesday, I suggested selling a $24 call option for October for a $1.25 premium. This would have at least brought in $23,000. They werent interested in this idea. I communicate my feelings on the market very early.

Another very real option is that the trading floor could be parcelled and sold to an outside company. There are discussion underway that deal with this possibility. Currently, we are not trading. We need to continue to report to work and keep a log of Real Time prices. Continue to update the Hourly Prices sheet for a record of prices. We may need these prices as support for liquidated damages. More counterparties will be defaulting and cutting schedules. Please make note of such cuts and prepare to bill LD's.

Does Demarc Deferred get allocated during the same cycles as Demarc? Answer: Yes 2. Seems unlikely since Demarc Deferred is a storage point and storage is allocated at a different time? Answer: A transportation delivery directly to Demarc Deferred is a part of the Demarc allocation. When NNG looks at a storage allocation, we review all the injections (or withdrawals) at the storage point. The two referenced allocations are done seperately, but during the same cycle. 3. If we were nominating our Firm from to Demarc Deferred where would our customers pull from? Answer: Customers can pick up gas at Demarc Deferred 4. The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location? Demarc or Demarc Deferred? Answer: Demarc Deferred Hopefully this helped. Thanks. ",candidate00012

If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated, can Power switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing?

2513,00275,candidate00012," I would like to recap my understanding and the ""To Do's"" from the meeting yesterday. 1. After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS physical volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing said TBS. 2. Measurement would check to see if they had a deduct meter they were using in the end user process. (Since the meeting we have discovered that the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be done). 3. Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if necessary) for negative volumes to the TBS. (We have talked with IT and this would be a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system). 4. Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the TBS connected to NNG. 5. Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including End User point volumes would be ""housed' in PGAS. After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a negative number. If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen: 1. Measurement should either: a. Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end user point higher than their TBS. b. Or Measurement can call on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk and will call LDC with the same info. 2. If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, then measurement will use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point. and , you may want to have more discussions on this topic. I would be glad to regroup if you want. I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue. Also Raetta and are going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be greater than the TBS. Hopefully it is just a measurement error. We will let you know the outcome. If there is something I missed, please let me know. Thanks. ",candidate00012

2689,00451,candidate00012," Ranelle, and , thought I would send this statement to you and see if this helps simplify our answer to your question. The question is: How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac) For Nominating purposes: MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate. Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point. EXAMPLE: If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will (1) total the reciepts nominated on the contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ. Then the shipper will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ. Anything over will be overrun at IT rate. If anyone has any other questions, please let me know. Thanks. ",candidate00012

2693,00455,candidate00012," We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for November 1. Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW: 1. SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas day (during all cycles). (Good news for TW) 2. SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750. If they do, they will maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW) 4. SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction. Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins. Starting Nov. 1, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact to SoCal's customers) 5. SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone. But, they are still giving us a capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations exceed their capacity. 6. SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation. This would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule. At that time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn. Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks. ",candidate00012

Everything here is going okay. I hope has had the baby by the time I get there this weekend. I sure don't want her to have to spend in the hospital. As far as dinner is concerned, we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams, etc. Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have dressing. Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so I'll try to call you on the way home. See ya! ",candidate00015
2741,00002,candidate00015," I spoke with Robin last night for a minute. You didn't tell me how good church was on Sunday. She said really preached and encouraged me to buy the tape! It must have been awesome! Anyway, are you going to rehearsal tonight? How are things going with 's party and have you set a time yet? What does he want/need for his birthday? I know he loves Power Rangers, but is there anything else, maybe something you had been planning to buy, (pajamas, underwear, shirt, pants, socks, etc.) Talk to ya! ",candidate00015

I think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you. Also there is a piece at Nicor that goes along with it, but it is a monthly volume commitment, and does not include balancing. I don't plan to give you that portion, but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up. The volume is roughly 33,000 for the month. ",candidate00015

2749,00010,candidate00015," Hey Nella, When I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last Friday. He said that everything was okay financially for the future, and they only had an immediate need for the tax money. He sounded okay with me asking about it. He even said ""You are so sweet with words"". He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him. How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside. We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling. In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike. They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers. All the kids enjoyed it so much, and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work. Bowling alleys notoriously have good food. Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday. I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark. This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm running about 10 minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of 's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again. Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last week. So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids. I want to call up their and complain, but I think I'll talk with her first (maybe!) She needs to get her stuff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks. Talk with you later ",candidate00015
2750,00011,candidate00015," That's funny, that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the fall. If I'm not mistaken, the ""O"" magazine, the one that Oprah Winfrey publlishes had a coupon for August stores. I'm not sure iif it was this issue or last month, but call the store and see, and it may be worth buying a magazine for the coupon. I'm not surprised about , it was such a late night. See you later ",candidate00015
2751,00012,candidate00015," What's Happening? How's it going? I will not be at rehearsal tonight because I'm going to get my hair done. I figured that you all will be practicing (is that how you spell practice) your songs and I will be in Omaha for so I don't need to learn the songs, as we only sing them on anyway. Besides, just in case you didn't hear, we don't sing this Sunday (We switch with the kids), since you all will sing on for all 4 services. This daylight savings time is nice. It's so nice to be able to get home and still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it gets dark. Did you find any houses that you liked? How long were you out? Talk with you later! ",candidate00015

2777,00017,candidate00016," Gene, I have a methodology that gives me the answer with 3 uses of the balance 50% of the time but requires 4 uses of the balance the other 50% of the time. Are you sure this can be done???? For my first use of the scales, I place a total of 6 balls on the scales (3 on each side). If they balance, then none of the six balls on the scales is the odd ball. If they do not balance, then none of the six balls that were left off of the scales is the odd ball. Thus, I have reduced the possible suspects to 6 after one use of the scales. Is this the right starting point??? Second, I place three balls that have been eliminated as suspects on one side of the scales and three balls that are still possibles on the other. Two outcomes: 1. If the scales do not balance, I know that one of the three suspects on the scales is the odd ball and I know whether it is heavier or lighter than the others. I can determine which is the odd ball on the third use of the scales by placing only one remaining suspect on each side of the scales. If they balance, then the suspect left off is the odd ball. If they do not balance, I know which one is odd because I already know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter. 2. If the scales balance on my second use of the scales, then I have three remaining suspects (the balls left off the scales) but do not know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter. I cannot figure out how to determine both the heavier/lighter question plus identify the odd ball in just one more use of the scales. I need two more uses. Am I close at all???? I hope that you had a good trip back. Stay in touch. ",candidate00016

2780,00020,candidate00016," The attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG than you are entitled to receive. Assuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end: 1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1 outage is 60 days or less 2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert 1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end 3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days The above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco is not assumed to be in an outage.

2785,00025,candidate00016," If the last Hoegh Galleon cargo of this year is diverted to Puerto , the economics of sending non-Cabot LNG to Puerto are different than those mentioned in my prior note. Based on current prices, there is $0.7 MM of value that could be captured between LNG and Eco on the diversion. This represents the price difference between what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us out of the terminal fee or let it apply to a future delivery, that would add an additional $1 MM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that adds another $4.7 MM. A second Hoegh Galleon cargo should add $1.5 MM but would need to be sourced from Nigeria or Algeria(???). Cabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 2001. It can be November 23-December 15 (unless another date is mutually agreeable). The date of this last delivery determines the earliest date that Eco would be able to receive the Hoegh Galleon. The earliest that Eco could receive the Hoegh Galleon should therefore be between December 20 and January 11 - depends on Cabot. Eco would be able to receive a second Hoegh Galleon cargo as soon as 29 days after the first Hoegh Galleon cargo delivery or as late as 45 days after. Two Hoegh Galleon cargoes should give Eco enough fuel (barely) to get them to the dates where they are eligible to receive the Early Spring cargo (100 days after the Last Cargo of 2001). In addition to the $$$'s available to be captured, this program removes Eco's risk of not receiving a Winter Cargo from Cabot. Economics and Timing - The amount of value to be captured is most heavily influenced by December-January NYMEX prices. These impact our cost to buy back gas at the CMS tailgate and our cost to buy the second Hoegh Galleon cargo. Our gas cost is more subject to change than is the Cabot contract price we are trying to beat. If we had a crystal ball, we would lock-in the economics of the diversion and of the purchase of the second cargo when the NYMEX bottoms-out. The front of the price curve has lost ~$1.00/MMBtu in the last 2 weeks. Where will it go from here? In order to be prepared to execute when market conditions are right, we need to get Eco on board and initiate discussions with a producer about supply for the second cargo. Also, we should talk with Gene Massey to confirm that the contract says what we think it says and to get his thoughts on what we are trying to do. I would appreciate any insights that you may have regarding this opportunity. Regards, ",candidate00016

Until we accomplish this, we will not win over the Afghan people who would like to be rid of the Taliban. As of today, defection is very risky and maybe almost impossible. We need bases of operation in more than one area of the country. The logistics of feeding and sheltering and supplying these troops may be difficult but not impossible. The Afghan people need our support on the ground if they are going to rise up against the Taliban. We are currently losing the media war. If our ground troops were hailed as liberators by the Afghan people and that was broadcast all over the world, we would start winning the war of words. We must control ground very soon. There will be casualties on our side and the American people must prepare themselves mentally. We are fighting a ruthless, brutal enemy. Our resolve must increase, not diminish, when images of our casualties begin to come across our television screens.

3152,00012,candidate00021," Dad asked if I wanted to lend you some money but I am reluctant to do it at this point in time since: a) I am not completely at liberty to touch all the cash that I have received lately for concern that it may be taken bank under potential creditor action against . Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really can't afford to lend any. The cash that I received recently represents 80% of the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash with any degree of certainty. Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this money for at least 6 months. b) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28. The new company deal that is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not be done until the month. If this deal falls through, then I have to find a job with another company. In this case, it is most likely that I will have to move back to the US since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared the the new deal) are there. c) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to the bank mortgage. With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a mortgage at 4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material enough. d) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank through a mortgage.

Zufferli ",candidate00021
3160,00020,candidate00021," We have traditionally have had currency issues in Canada regarding P&L preservation versus cashflow preservation. We have been valued in P&L under the US$ but due to Revenue Canada reasons our functional currency has been C$ (i.e. the preponderence of cashflows were in C$ from the legacy gas deals, PetroCanada, Suncour, etc, and the PPA position). Since trader evaluation at year end has been in US$, traders would hedge C$ positions immediately as the trade occured. The hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book. From a P&L systems point of view, this would preserve the trader's P&L in US$. However, from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands; these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades, physical trades and inter-company trades. There was also some currency risk (albeit small) between billing dates from SAP and settlement dates of the respective trade type. It is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems. To a certain extent, I am indifferent if it is US$ or C$. The timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the SAP system. They are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by Jan 29. This is the date that they have been told to meet by . As a result, we would need a determinination of the functional currency by Mon Jan 28. ",candidate00021

3162,00022,candidate00021," I sent you an update of the Hedge Summary for July 3, 2001. In that I mentioned that I bought 125 MW of Cal02 at 10 HR flat. I am long over 500 MW at this heat rate. The biggest risk in this position is a large hydro year that tanks the Mid-C (i.e. uncorrelated event with gas). Mid-C off-peak is $47 USD, Nymex fixed price for Cal02 is $3.79 USD and Sumas basis is $0.16 for Cal02. This implies a heat rate of close to 11.9 for the off-peak Mid-C. I am thinking about buying back some AECO gas hedge for Cal02, then selling Mid-C off-peak to replace the gas hedge. Perhaps as winter blow-out protection, buy some Jan-Feb Sumas basis. The trade for a 25 MW long flat position would be: a) sell 25 MW of Mid-C off-peak b) buy 0.25 contracts /day of AECO fixed price Cal02 gas (i.e. to unwind the off-peak portion of the the gas hedge) c) buy 0.25 contracts/day of Sumas Jan-Feb basis See what you think??

Under Section 4.A., we need to add something like, ""IN the event that ENA owes Company, payment will be made to Company after ENA has received funds from third party sales of excess supply."" This situation has occurred when the plant was down for the majority of the month. ENA sold the supply and net owed Tenaska IV a large sum of money after the admin fee was netted out. Additionally, TXU pipeline has sent an amendment to the transport contract (adding receipt points). The contract still has Tenaska Gas Co as a counterparty, instead of North America.

With the sale of HPL, we were left with only one scheduler with Texas experience. took on the responsibility that two people were carrying prior to the sale of the pipeline (Waha scheduling). He trained our new hire, Smith, and assisted in developing scheduling processes at the Hub. Prior to the sale of HPL, all of our activity at the hub passed through the pipeline. used his knowledge of the Waha hub and helped develop a net out procedure that allowed us to effectively schedule our transactions. Since June, has handled the logistics activities of the majority of Texas pipes (Westar, HPL, PGE, Channel, Oasis, Guadalupe). most outstanding accomplishment is the over $30,000 he saved us in hub transport fees from July to November. In July, I began tracking the amount of hub fees that we should have to pay in the Waha area (on EOL we transacted on the basis that the seller pays the transport fees through the hub). used his knowledge of the pipes, his business relationships, and his negotiation skills to decrease the amount of gas that we scheduled under our contracts. In essence, I kept a sort of P&L for him. has taken the desks responsibilities upon himself, as if this were his business. With the limited number of people on our desk, I needed to split my time between Logistics and Trading. Truthfully, I spent the majority of my time with the trading. handled the daily logistics responsibilities. He acted as lead, supervising and training , our other team member. performed at a senior level since his first month with the desk. came to the desk with experience on the pipeline side of the business, accepting nominations and confirming the plants and interconnects. He came to the Texas desk and exceeded all of my expectations. He has advanced quicker than any of the schedulers I've seen. In fact, he has gone from very minimal marketing logistics knowledge to explaining transactions and processes to other people in the industry with more experience than him. In short, has been the heart of the Texas Logistics team. His abilities and hard work have reduced our transport fees, kept our headcount low (he has fulfilled the responsibilities of two people), and enabled the Texas Desk to close time sensitive deals and transact in increasingly complicated deals. is a superior employee. His knowledge, ability, and hard work are essential to the success of the Texas Desk. Please support him with a promotion. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any information.

3278,00062,candidate00022," , We need to talk about the ability of ENA to continue its the current role as agent of Tenaska IV. 1) Since the end on November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions. We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas. This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy. As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel. We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while). In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th. For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future. 2) For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold. However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out. ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline. Armstrong paid the counterparties directly. I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan. We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.

As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to take their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty. After having struggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations of how the ENE stock should be valued. Any method other than the number of shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforded a look back option. Some might say this is easy for me since I did not have ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fairly. Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable. The solution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation under the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of the ENE stock valuation.

3323,00039,candidate00023," I know you are frustrated with the adherence to the VAR limits or lack there of, so I do not want to frustrate you more, but I would like you to consider the following suggestions. 1) It does not seem logical that the VAR limit between the Central, East and Texas Desk be so far apart. Under the current limits the Central desk can have a position 2,000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1,000 Contracts larger. 2) When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses. VAR LIMITS DESK P/L EAST $10 MILLION ($66.1) MILLION CENTRAL $12 MILLION ($13.9) MILLION TEXAS $8 MILLION $55.8 MILLION 3) It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as & I. There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated. In fact in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit. I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR limit. The P/L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than $500,000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit. (For example if a desks VAR limit is 10,000,000 and the VAR is $12,000,000 the P/L for the desk would be decreased by $2,000,000. If the situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed.) This method I believe makes for an even playing field. Under the current procedures what I'm learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules. Please give me your thoughts when you have a chance. Thanks, ",candidate00023

3328,00044,candidate00023," : Assuming you can get comfortable with a percentage MMBtu enhancement from someone like (the only one I would trust) I would suggest a method that would reflect more than the spread. The way I look at this is that the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from storage is an unaccounted for gain. As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percentage was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume. We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would try to capture this value also. Because under normal Accounting procedures for storage, barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refilling, this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining inventory. Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu factor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected as a gain. We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increases your risk if the MMBtu enhancement percentage you use is too high! I would appreciate being kept informed of what MMBtu enhancement percentage is used and how it is put in the model. ",candidate00023

We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001. If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel? Have we been paid by Heartland Steel? Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom? Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel? While the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty. you please let me know how we should proceed. I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an representative.

We'll probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or so and come on through to Omaha. I'm sad to hear that Daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job. I had to hear that, because I too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better. I'm so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands. I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well. I spoke with Mom yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is. She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape. I asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing, he is not ready yet. but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and not wait. I just hope he understands. I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of pain. I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up. It's so hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it. The good part, if there is any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering. He's certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain. Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom.

3459,00020,candidate00026," Hey girl, What's going on? It is truly a slow day over here. So far, I really could have taken the day off and would not have missed anything. Last night I had a date with my mother-in-law. She's a member of a book club and they had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel. It was nice, but long. The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at 6:00. The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at 6:45. I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated. But, girl, Ms Thang felt so good last night. I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire. After I left church, I went to one of my favorite stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt. The top that I bought set it off so nicely. It was black, light brown and gold! I wore my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel sandals that show all my foot. Boy, I felt good about my appearance. When I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said ""Mommy.......you look pretty. Made my evening. Of course, Bozo the husband, didn't say one word. But I felt good, I even had Jordan take some pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile). We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really entails, but it must of been ugly. He was pissed!

The actual volumes that you are reporting and consider to be your monthly actuals are volumes that I believe are behind Vectren's city gate (which means that you more than likely have an imbalance on Vectren's system). This bears checking with Vectren, regarding an imbalance behind their gate. You should be receiving some type of statement or invoice from Vectren.

3539,00021,unknown," Group, A quick important reminder. Recently our disputes with EPE and other SW counterparties have been growing. While I recognize that we have some newer members in the group, it is the responsibility of the senior members of the group to train and help the newer members to avoid mistakes. The EPE system is not overly complex. If you have questions during a shift call ME first. Do not wake up , do not go inadvertant. Our notes on the deal sheet need to include whether the power is firm or econ (again--you should almost never buy econ--). The EPE lending fee was recently renegotiated down to $2. We have to be sharp in our marketing of their system to maintain our ability to lend and to lend at $2. Disputes with counterparties will quickly erase this opportunity. Marketing for EPE, making appropriate choices with regards to the units, checking out with dispatchers on time, and reconciling the CARP are basic expectations for this position and MUST be met. If you have questions, please see me. We will discuss EPE and EOL in our meeting at the start of September. Thanks, ",candidate00004

3549,00031,unknown," Hey ! Very glad to finally hear from you. Sounds like you are happy back in Austrailia! I would love to see it sometime. Unless things change between now and January, some of us are suppose to be on the Poly on January 6th. We have booked our trip and the pictures of the beaches on St. look fabulous. We are going in on the 3rd to stay a few days before we get on the boat. I hope you are there. Although I would understand if you stayed where you are! Keep me posted on your plans - whether you stay in Austrailia or go back to work on the Poly. As for the recent tragedies here, I am so very lucky that no one really close to me was killed. I actually flew in from on Monday night, just in time not to get stuck there. One of my very good friends was suppose to be in the WTC, worked on the 105th floor of tower one on monday and was called back to for a meeting tuesday. Flew out of Laguardia at 7:30 am tuesday morning. That meeting saved his life. I am so glad that he had that meeting. I would have been devasted if something had happened to him. However, all of the people in their offices there are missing. He is very sad but greatful to be alive. It does make you think about what you are doing with your life and what is important but I don't think it will make me stop traveling or doing the things that I love to do. It is sad that this thing has already affected our freedom, some more so than others. Most things won't be as easy as they once were - but I guess that ease and freedom were taken for granted. I also can't believe that someone could come in and do so much harm to innocent people. And I don't know what should be done to stop such things from happening in the future. Can I just run away to the beach and ignore it? It's a good thing that not everyone has that attitude! Anyway, I am glad to hear that you are well and having fun. I am doing the same - just here in ugly for now! I think that my trip to Aruba for October has changed so I better get something planned before the end of the year!

3591,00073,unknown," Terry, please review and let me know if this sounds OK. Thanks. We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for November 1. Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW: 1. SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas day (during all cycles). (Good news for TW) 2. SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750. If they do, they will maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW) 4. SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle for the gas day. Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins. Starting Nov. 1, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact to SoCal's customers) 5. SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone. But, they are still giving us a capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations exceed their capacity. 6. SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation. This would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule. At that time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn. Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks. ",candidate00012

3653,00135,unknown," Hey guys, Thought I'd drop you a line and catch up on life. If I'm not mistaken you're actually in Australia right now doing all kinds of fun and active things, so you probably won't get this for a few days. I can't tell you how glad I am that you've had a chance to take advantage of all the travel possibilities on that side of the world ( and not just a little jealous). I think all of these experiences are going to leave you with some incredible memories of your time in South Korea. As for myself, this weekend will mark only the second in the last month and a half or so that I will be spending in . I figured by now I'd be traveled out but I can't get enough. The Caymans were incredible...we ate at great restaurants (not Bed unfortunately, but I did see it), got to go scuba diving off the east end and swam with a slew of stingrays. Actually, I was holding onto/bonding with one of the stingrays, just floating with the current, for about 5 minutes until I had to gently shove it off and swim back into safe proximity of the boat. It was a completely surreal experience. Plus, the trip solidified my appreciation and fondness for the new job, and more specifically the new co-workers, which is never a bad thing. Speaking of the new job, things are going well. I still have a ton to learn but I have a feeling that will be the case for a long time to come. There is just an overwhelming amount of information, not to mention strategies and nuances to learn about gas trading as a whole and in particular the western region of the US. I've been actively trading for well over a month now and am getting to know all the players in my market as well as gaining confidence with each additional trade. So far so good though...I'm definitely glad I made the choice to stay in and take on this role. I had a pledge sister's wedding in San a few weeks ago, which was fun, and another ""sister's"" wedding this weekend here in . I tell you, it's out-of-control with all of my friend's weddings & engagements. Two weekends ago I got hit with 3, yes you heard correctly 3, new engagements of close friends. I am very rapidly becoming out-numbered on this front. Still, the only thing that crosses my mind each time I hear of a new one, aside from being thrilled for the happy couple of course, is that I am a ways off from such an endeavor myself. I just have the feeling I've got a lot of changing to do in the next year or two (or more) and am not sure that what I'd want now is what I'll want then. Okay, change of subject...getting to deep. Two weekends ago I went with a few of the traders from the desk to Las Vegas. We went to meet some of our power traders from Portland to discuss west energy issues and to try and squeeze in a little fun. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, I think we managed to squeeze in more than a little fun. I think my earliest arrival back at the hotel room that weekend was around 6:30 am. I don't know if it's the oxygen they constantly pump into the clubs and casinos or the steady flow of free drinks, but you really do lose all track of time there. I feel certain any duration longer that a weekend would either kill me or force me to take another vacation just to recover. I managed to walk away only $40 bucks in the hole so all in all I was feeling pretty good. What the future holds? - I'm planning a trip to London in early June to visit and then she comes back to for about a month, so I'm really looking forward to that. And, I'm still trying to figure out when I'm going to come visit you guys...I was thinking August, given your trip to Hawaii in July and my trip to London in June, so let me know your thoughts. September is also an option if that works better for you. I think I'll try to take 6 or 7 work days off so that we could travel while I'm over there if we wanted to and so we'd have two weekends. Anyway, it's obviously still in the incubation phase. the trip was a rousing success and I'll talk to you soon, ",candidate00010

3662,00144,unknown," once, a long time ago, i think you copied some words of wisdom for me from the Importance of Living...if it wasn't you it's not important, because the point is that i recently found them again and reread them today. i think you should read them too, if not for the first time, then again and with fresh eyes.... ""the ancient people who desired to have a clear moral harmony in the world would first order their national life; those who desired to order their national life would first regulate their home life; those who desired to regulate their home life would first cultivate their personal lives; those who desired to cultivate their personal lives would first set their hearts right; those who desired to set their hearts right, would first make their wills sincere; those who desired to make their wills sincere would first arrive at understanding; understanding comes from the exploration of knowledge of things. when the knowledge of things in gained, then understanding is reached; when understanding is reached, then the will is sincere; when the will is sincere, then the heart is set right; when the heart is set right, then the personal life is cultivated; when the personal life is cultivated, then the home life is regulated; when the home life is regulated the national life is orderly; and when the national life is orderly, then the world is at peace. from the emperor down to the common man, the cultivation of the personal life is the foundation for all. it is impossible that when the foundation is disorderly, the superstructure can be orderly. there has never been a tree whose trunk is slender and whose top branches are heavy and strong. there is a cause and a sequence in things, and a beginning and end in human affairs. to know the order of precedence is to have the beginning of wisdom."" right now i think both of us are at the beginning, i.e. ""exploration of knowledge of things""...and i think the ""things"" in this instance refer to those ""things"" in the past year which have dumb-founded us each individually. i know you want to get to those heavy and strong top branches (and i think to a large extent children and caring for your partner in old age represent those branches for you), but they will not come without the trunk...you can't jump the sequence of things. now is the time for exploration, and i believe you are well on your way in that regard, but above all you must remember that time is the key...and that you can't rush yourself in this process. hope the skiing is great and i will talk to you soon.

3667,00149,unknown," Group, EOL is off to a great start and is already becoming an integral part of the real-time market! Each person who has put in substantial extra time entering and reconciling deals deserves congratulations. I do recognize and appreciate the hard work. As always, there is more work to be done. We have had significant difficulty integrating the increased volume of EOL trades into our current business practice. Some members of the group have experienced limited success, others have experienced little to no success. A standardization in our process will benefit the entire group and will allow us to make consistent improvements as time goes on. So going forward. 1. All deals will be done under ST-Whourly. If there is lending, parking or a cut that corresponds to another book, we will make that deal for the entire strip (for example, W-BOM sells to EPE for HE 7-22--all one deal). We will then sell or buy the appropriate amount of energy from Whourly to that book (this interdesk deal will not be routed). We will do the interdesk transaction as one deal and will enter deal strips with pricing for each hour or hours where appropriate and will include transmission charges when necessary. In Enpower, use strips wherever possible...try to avoid extending deals in scheduling. 2. All imports and exports will be under the appropriate desk (for example ST-SW exporting from SP-15 to FC MUST be under ST-SW in CAPS). This will allow us to put everything under Whourly and have export/import fees paid for by the appropriate desk. Otherwise the Whourly book will be charged for wheeling and/or potentially congestion for other desks. When filling a Service customer (such as Wheelabrator or EES) we should pay for the import and export fees. 3. A ""skeleton"" of an inc sheet should be developed as soon as possible each day. Sales/purchases to or from EES should be made for the day and immediately input into the service sheet. Likewise...Service deals/Lending/Parking should be put into the sheet for the day where possible. I would like to implement all of these practices immediately. Effective HE 1 08/29/01, THIS is our new business practice. Spread the word. I am looking for more suggestions for improvements on our process. We will have a meeting on September 4 to discuss group direction and ideas for improvement. This will be an important meeting at 4 PM on Tuesday September 4th. Please plan to attend.

3686,00168,unknown," Hi everybody. It's . It's Friday afternoon, March 1. I hope everybody has had a great week. I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop. The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion. I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues. Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable. I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues. In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund. We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees. I wanted you to be aware of that. I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset. Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program. As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification. The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee. We provided to them more data. McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28. We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program. I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is 's and my highest priority. It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed. I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court. I'll keep you posted on progress. I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs. Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail. The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions. Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week. Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases. And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process. So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases. We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract. It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate. I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund. I'd like your input on that. I thought it was a great idea and very generous. We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month. Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there. I've tried to get around to say hello here and there. And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz. Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries. Other than that I don't have a lot to report. We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program. Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area. I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward. One other thing... We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon. We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here. We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting. I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in 's future. I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting. Anyway, as I was saying... Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication. I hope you have a great weekend. I'll chat with next week. ",candidate00003

3694,00176,unknown," For tomorrow, see the attached schedule. This is what is communicated to Frontera. The mw value at the top of the page indicates what their total generation should be by hour. The Resource Plan shuold be identical to this row. Row 5 mirrors the purchase from Frontera in Enpower. The Mirant call and 's call (Ercot Asset Book - 100 mw's) are listed as well as any daily trades executed on behalf of Frontera. Please familiarize yourself with this report The top line will indicate how much power is available for bal-day sales, etc. Additionally, the Resource Plan needs to accurately reflect to Ercot what the plant is capable of. For example, if we are generating at the maximum of 450 mw's, we need to reflect that the combined maximums on units 1-3 do not exceed this amount. Otherwise, Ercot thinks they can OOM you up. Specifically for tomorrow, please note that we are going from 135 mw hour ending 6 to 250 mw's hour ending 7. The plant doesnt like to do this. A 200 mw schedule would be much more preferrable for this ramp. So either : 1. purchase 50 mw's from RT market for he 7. Change Resource Plan to 200 mw's for hour ending 7 only. Put purchase from in Teco Services book. Make another corresponding sale to Frontera counterparty in the Teco Services book. If you dont make the second entry in Enpower the Teco Services book will be long for hour ending 7. 2. have plant drag and buy imbalance - they will call to make this decision. No entries will be needed. Call if you have questions. JMF ",candidate00011

3764,00246,unknown," Hey Pooky, The rest of the weekend was fine. I forgot to tell you on Saturday night about our choir's performance at this community function we had. In fact, I was on my way home when you and I were talking. Sometimes our choir members are so sad, they don't always show up at functions and events like they should, unless its an opportunity to showboat. So.....I had to sing on the front row on Saturday evening. We sounded like crap....I was so embarassed, I actually got so hot and started sweating, because of my embarassment. It was awful. I just thought about that when your e-mail arrived. Kendall was very whinny and cried alot yesterday, I actually thought he might be getting sick, because that was so out of character for him, but he's back to his old self now, just talking alot and being hard-headed. I just called the lawyer again and got the secretary....she said that she had been out sick with pneumonia and the attorney had some major oral surgery, so she could not talk....so I'll give this firm the benefit of the doubt. The secretary said she would have her call me back shortly or at least the secretary would call me and let me know. So ""F"" is starting to feel the effects of his years of dishing out dirt. I hate that it hurts, but most men do end up regretting their previous behavior. I know what you mean about your Dad. In my case, my dad would be saying, hold on.... Anyway, I love you too and can't wait to see where we both go from here..... ",candidate00026

The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops. Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think? (The lady at the spa recommended the second one) Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment. Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow. Time: 90 minutes Pacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute message that completes the treatment. Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin. Time: 90 minutes Ta Ta, ",candidate00010

We need to buy a transmission wheel from BPA (Account#736780) from PGE System to the Montana System Border. If need be we can also do a Buy-Resale with WWP to move the energy from PGE Sys/Mid-C/LOLO to the Montana System Border. The method for documentation and cleaning up enpower are below. 1.) In enpower, build an index forward buy from PGE under LTNW book for the total amount of mws cut due to colstrip going down. Use the DOW JONES MIDC index (remember to specify in the index if it is on or off-peak). Enter an offset of .10 . 2.) Enter a transmission deal from BPA. (MIDC to MPC SYS) The transmission fee is $2.52 3.) Go into deal scheduling and query under the counterparty PGE. Select all 4.) Bring up all deals of the counterparties involved at Colstrip---- specifically, Ashgrove,Conocpil, Energywesr, Louisiana Pacific, and Smurfit , etc. (these enpower deal numbers can be located under the counterparties name in lotus notes.) 5.)Zero out the buy from PGE @MPC SYS 6.)

ALL DEALS UNDER ST-WHOURLY--except a lending/parking deal or cut. For example if we are lending with ST-SW and we buy for them in NP-15. The buy in NP-15 is under ST-WHOURLY, the EPMICALPOOL Buy/Resale from NP-15 to FC345 is under ST-WHOURLY, the INTER-DESK sale is made under ST-WHOURLY (at the end of the day--see #3), and the sale to EPE is under ST-SW. The export in CAPS is also under ST-SW. 2. ONE DEAL FOR AN ON-PEAK or OFF-PEAK PURCHASE or SALE.--For example one deal for a sale to the imbalance, one deal for a sale to EPE 3. ONE DEAL FOR AN INTER-DESK SALE or PURCHASE--done by the NIGHT SHIFT at the weighted average price for the entire strip, transmission costs should be included. We are just averaging the purchase price or sale price for specific deals. (see ST-WBOM SP-15 section of AUG TRADING sheet on 08/29/01 for an example) 4. INC SHEETS MUST BE MAINTAINED, DEALS ENTERED AND ROUTED EACH HOUR--only way to stay ahead 5. WE ARE GENERATING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REVENUE AND PROFIT TRADING WITH EOL (over $130,000 in the last 5 days alone--does not include congestion revenue!)--530+ trades, 13,100 extra mws traded with EOL in 8 days. 6.

3957,00439,unknown," I spoke with Dale Sanders at today. They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work. I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003. I did not think that they would be able to get Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity. However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity. Obviously that is the key to being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d. I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d. Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely. If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest. Especially on the heels of the Kern expansion. In addition, the market will definitely strengthen in the back years. Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments. ",candidate00009

Basically, the pool is agnostic, it pays power producers for the pyhsical energy delivered to the grid and it charges power consumers for energy taken from the grid. Any financial arrangements between the buyers and sellers are not known to the pool. The only mechanism the pool uses for physical power transactions is the direct sale mechanism. The terms and volume of these direct sales are entered in the pool's trading system. The pool then subracts the volume of the direct sale from the consumers and producers meter and pays/charges the producer/consumer on the net volume (i.e actual production-direct sales or actual consumption-direct sales) ",candidate00021

Currently in Scada we have Griffith Power Plant El Paso and Griffith Power Plant TW. Please get familiar with the points and how set points will need to be sent. To change El Paso, the set point will be at 1. TW will be at 2. When you send flow set points of 140,000 that will automatically convert to pressure control. Set points less than 140,000 will stay on flow control. We will have to experiment with set points when we have orders on TW and El Paso. Currently we have orders just off of TW. 1. Currently El Paso is set on 140,000 flow which will control on pressure and TW flow set point is at 120,000. this is on flow control. 2. When we have a flow order from El Paso we may want to set them on flow control and TW on pressure. We will just have to experiment with the best operation. 3. Remember the above mentioned is at the plant and not at the TW Mainline I/C. We are working with Citizens to be able to see El Paso Mainline I/C.(El Paso will be responsible for the Mainline I/C and setpoints.)

This left a profit of $17996 to be divided between ST-Whourly and L-Pac-30/70. Consequently, ST-Whourly made an annuity to L-Pac for their part of the profit share, Deal #531549--$12597.73. All this left RT with a profit of $5399. If you place all the deals under LT-NW...it will be a large impact on ST-NW, and will result in LT-NW getting paid a couple of times. These profit share numbers are accurate. After expenses--LT-NW gets $5472 for the original deal, then ST-WH gets $5399 and L-Pac gets $12597.73. All these annuities cannot just be killed as they liquidated on the 26th--of February. It is probably a better idea to put everything back under the ST-NW book...ideas? Questions? Just come see me and let me know. ",candidate00004

4011,00493,unknown, Citizens Griffith Az. I/C (Mainline Takeoff)(GRIF) The lo pressure alarm on the analog page for the downstream pressure going to the Griffith plant from TW's mainline has been reset at 800#. The lo lo pressure alarm is set at 750#. Reason: This should give you time to react to possible low pressure concerns in the 3 to 4 miles of pipe from mainline to Griffith plant and hopefully prevent any plant upsets. This is for our protection. You may need to raise the setpoint. For call outs for alarms TW operations is responsible. If anyone does not agree with this please let me know and we can discuss. Griffith Power Plt. El Paso and TW (CITZ) We monitor these two sites as EMAR for Citizens. Remember anytime you receive alarms on these points you refer to the call out list for Citizens. If you have questions please refer to the handout you received or call me. The plant is currently down and planning on coming on line and commercial Tuesday September 11. There are still some questions on which is the better way to set the site for flows. Let me know what you think of setting TW on pressure control and El Paso on flow control. Reason: TW pressure is higher and with El Paso on flow control this will allow TW to take the swing when Griffith has orders from both pipelines. Let me know of your experience with this and let's discuss and write up some guidelines for us to follow. Thanks DS ,candidate00008
4012,00494,unknown," Hey , Ok, first the bad news...I can't come up President's weekend for the Whistler trip. Now the good news, I'm going to be in Seattle next weekend. I'm coming to have a 2nd round interview with Cascade Natural Gas (whose headquarters is actually right around downtown - looks like maybe Belltown). Anyway, I fly in Thursday and don't leave until Monday. The interview will be Friday, much like my set-up last time. So, if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together. I think I'm really going to look for housing on this trip. Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday. Talk to you soon, ",candidate00010
