0,00001,candidate00001,"""Arson Task Force Blazes A Trail"", the headline read. The Herald story went on to describe how the team had slashed the number of arsons by twenty-five per cent in its first year. ""Well done, Sam,"" Les said, slapping me on the back. ""Some people said you couldn’t do it, but I knew you were the man for the job - that’s why I picked you."" Les is my father-in-law as well as brigade chief. I knew he’d only made me Task Force leader to please Mary. The team was his pride and joy. He set it up after a fact-finding visit to America and it was the first of its kind in the UK. When the job as leader came up, I told Mary it would probably go to one of the whizz kids the brigade was fast tracking. ""It’s not fair,"" she said, her face turning an angry red. ""You’ve been overlooked year after year while they promote kids hardly out of training. Just because they’ve got university degrees. What do they know about firefighting? I suppose you’re not going to do anything about it, as usual. It’s just as well you can count on me then, isn’t it? I’ll have a word with Dad."" I flinched. It was a knee-jerk reaction whenever she mentioned Les’ name. ""Leave it,"" I said, through tight lips. ""Why can’t you understand that I’m happy being a station officer? I’m not ambitious."" ""That’s your department,"" I thought. ""You’ve got enough for the two of us."" I wanted to say it but I didn’t. After almost 25 years of marriage I’d learned life was a lot simpler if I kept my mouth shut. ""Why aren’t you a go-getter like dad?"" she’d demanded for the umpteenth time. ""He made chief when he was only 40. He’s the youngest chief the brigade has ever had."" I looked at her coldly, wondering how many years it was since her once-pretty face had become so hard. Had it happened overnight? Or so gradually, I hadn’t noticed. I sat frowning in silence. Oh, I could have told her about the backs Les had stabbed in his ruthless climb to the top, and how he might be the youngest, but he was the most despised chief the brigade had ever had. But I didn’t. Without saying another word I reached for Bruno’s lead. As usual Mary got her way. She spoke to Les and I got the job. I could have turned it down. But it wouldn’t have been worth all the grief I’d have got from Mary. It would probably have cost our marriage. We weren’t exactly living in wedded bliss. Not by a long chalk. Our marriage had been on shaky ground for years, but I’m just too lazy to do anything about it. Like a lot of fellas I know, I’m what you could call happily, unhappily married. I should have left Mary – and Les – long ago. Now it was too late; I couldn’t face the hassle. Years ago I almost did. I wasn’t so stuck in my ways in those days. I had started an affair. Who hadn’t? All the lads were at it. Sheila was divorced and worked in the control room. Six months we’d been seeing each other and I was seriously thinking about leaving Mary and moving in with Sheila. If Mary suspected, she never let on. Les knew… naturally. Les knows everything. But he never said a word. Then one day, out of the blue, Sheila left the brigade. She said her new job paid more, had better prospects. I wondered if Les had something to do with it. Sheila denied it. Anyway after that we didn’t see each other as much and the relationship kind of fizzled out. After that I had the odd one night stand, but never anything serious. When I took the leader’s job, I made myself a vow that I’d do whatever it took to make a success of it and once and for all crawl from under Les’ shadow. For a brief time it looked like all my efforts had paid off. The Herald report was only half the story; it failed to reveal how the team was a victim of its own success. ""We’ve won praise from the Home Office for reducing fires to the lowest level for a decade - for all the good it’ll do us,"" Les said, his voice bitter. ""This could mean job cuts or the team… "" He pulled his right hand across his throat in a slashing movement. It was catch 22; the more fires, the more money the government forked out. I knew there would have to be some belt tightening, but I’d never dreamed the team might be axed. The taste of success turned sour in my mouth. A picture of Mary thumbing through brochures looking for a holiday to celebrate our silver wedding flashed into my head. ""I want to go somewhere really exotic,"" she announced. ""Somewhere that’ll make the neighbours green with envy."" Then there was Susan’s wedding in the autumn. ""I want a real flash do,"" Mary insisted. ""Give the neighbours something to really talk about."" I looked away. I knew it still rankled that I’d nearly been demoted for being drunk on duty. Not a day went by without Mary reminding me it was Les who’d saved my job. That was nine years ago. I’ve never touched another drop since. And as wave after wave of cuts hit the brigade I had to cling on by my fingernails, knowing all the time it was my father-in-law’s influence that continued to save me. I was in the King’s Arms the night after the press conference announcing the Task Force’s first year report. ""Saw you on the telly,"" my mate Bob said. ""At this rate you’ll be out of a job."" My face must have shown my concern because he added, ‘Hey, don’t look so worried. I was only joking."" I told Bob about the funding situation. ""My squad might be disbanded."" I gulped down a mouthful of orange juice. ""I feel like starting fires myself to push the number up."" I was worried sick. In her drive to impress the neighbours Mary spent money like we had our own personal printing machine. I thought about our overdraft all the time. The Task Force had to survive. Although I hadn’t wanted the job at first, I had got used to the increased salary. I needed the extra dosh to keep up with Mary’s constant spending. Also I had worked my balls off to make it a success and I wanted to prove I didn’t need Les behind me all the time. Now it looked as though it was all a waste of time. It didn’t take the government number crunchers long to break the bad news. The ink was hardly dry on the first year report when the letter arrived announcing that funding was being reduced. Rumours about job losses were rife, but nobody knew how many would go. A budget meeting was called for the following month and a delegation was going to Whitehall to lobby ministers. Until a decision was made, work went on as usual. The school summer holidays had started so my daily school visits to educate youngsters on the dangers of starting fires was over until September. But there was still plenty to do, talking to residents, community groups and youths clubs; hammering home the fire prevention message. The first in a spate of arson attacks began days into the school holidays. A supermarket was the first to go up. Two days later a comprehensive school’s science block was left a blackened shell. Next a mountain of tyres was set on fire. Bored school kids were blamed. The fires were in different parts of the brigade’s area and there was nothing to link them… not then. I was called in to investigate. ""At this rate we’ll not have to worry about losing funding,"" Les snapped irritably, when he came over for tea on Thursday. He’d been coming every Thursday since Mary’s mother died three years ago. ""What’s the latest on the funding?"" I asked, between mouthfuls of cottage pie. Les looked up from helping himself to seconds. ""Don’t ask me, I’m only the Chief,"" he said, shortly. ""You sly bastard,"" I thought. Nothing escaped Les. He knew how every penny was spent - even down to the last paper clip. He knew every firefighter under his command and every dodge they were up to because he’d invented most of them. Mary scowled. ""Oh, don’t talk shop you two, you do it every week. I get it every day from Sam, without getting a double helping on Thursday."" She was wearing another new dress. ""She thinks we’re made of bloody money?"" I thought about the overdraft and my stomach turned to acid. ""Dad, wait till I show you where I’ve chosen for our silver wedding,"" she added. Before the month was out, my team had six more arsons to probe. They included two factory units, a cash and carry warehouse, a redundant church, school gym and an office block. They all made front-page news in the Herald. ""Looks like you won’t have to start any fires because someone’s beaten you to it,"" Bob said, when we next met up in the King’s Arms. I’d forgotten the remark I’d made weeks before. ""What the Hell are you on about?"" I demanded. ""OK. Don’t lose your hair."" Bob chuckled but looked at me strangely. Les constantly demanded progress on the investigations and he was annoyed when the police forensic experts came up with the breakthrough first. They found traces of the same accelerant at all the fires. Les wanted a lid kept on the information because he didn’t want the public to be panicked about a serial arsonist on the loose. He was furious when a reporter ferreted out the information and it made headline news. Soon there was speculation where the arsonist would strike next. People didn’t have to wait long to find out. Days later another school was hit. This time the fire tore through the whole building. Sixty firefighters battled all night in vain to save it. Never slow to leap onto something that could boost sales, the Herald put a £1,000 reward on the arsonist’s head. ""I want this bugger found fast,"" Les growled the following Thursday teatime. ""I don’t want some little sod spoiling my record for me when I retire in a couple of months."" ""If anyone can turn this to their advantage, you can,"" I thought. He’d make sure he went out in a blaze of glory. Over Mary’s toad-in-the hole, we watched the news and a grim-faced Les saying: ""We’re closely monitoring the incidents of arson in the area, and our message to arsonists is clear - your actions will not be tolerated."" News of the fire epidemic and the hunt for the fire starter screamed from newspapers, television and radio. Everywhere I heard people talking about it and there was no shortage of speculation about who was responsible. Suspects questioned over previous incidents were pulled in by police and news leaked out about two others quizzed by detectives. I knew them both. Tony Adamson lived in my street. He had been sacked from the supermarket a week before it burned down. He felt he’d been unfairly treated and one night when drunk he’d been overheard threatening to get even, if it was the last thing he did. Another suspect was a local teenager called Danny Bleacher, who’d served time in a youth offender’s institution for a string of arson attacks on schools. I had given evidence at his trial where a psychiatrist described him as having a morbid fascination for fires. He said they gave him a bigger kick than any drug. He’d started with hoax calls and cut his teeth on rubbish fires. He was eventually caught because he liked to watch the schools burn. A few days before I’d read an interview Danny had given to the Herald. ""People are saying I did it,"" he said. ""I didn’t. I started fires when I was young and stupid. I’m not proud of that but I’ve served my time and learned my lesson. My mum’s ill, she needs me. It would kill her if I went back inside."" The police had no evidence to hold Tony or Danny and they were released without any charges being brought. Soon after, a fresh rumour began circulating. Whoever started the fires had specialist knowledge, it said. So now the public finger was pointed at a firefighter. After two weeks of fire frenzy, there was a lull for a week. The jungle drum said the arsonist had been caught on close circuit television and the police were closing in. There were the usual stories in the local rag about there not being enough bobbies on the beat. This pleased Les because it took some of the flak away from the brigade. I’d been away for a few days on a course, and came home to find Mary had been on another spending spree. With the trip to Bali coming up, it was the last straw. ""For God’s sake, Mary, we’re not made of money,’ I said crossly. ""I might not have a job after tomorrow’s budget meeting."" ""You’ve got nothing to worry about."" ""Have you been talking to Les?"" I demanded. ""He’s my dad and your boss, if I want him to help us, you can’t blame me."" ""Besides,"" she shrugged her shoulders, brown from a series of tanning sessions, ""with all these arsons, they’ll need an arson task force, you said so yourself."" I shook my head. ""We’ll just have to wait and see."" I wasn’t sure which way the meeting would swing. The brigade was facing a crisis. But one more big fire might convince the politicians to keep the task force. After tea Mary flounced out saying she was going to the bingo, hopefully to win the jackpot, then she could buy some new clothes for Bali with a clean conscience. I looked at her wondering when the rot had started to set in. When had I let Mary and Les take over my life? I didn’t hate her. I just didn’t love her any more. It wasn’t the kind of stuff I could talk to my mates about. And Susan was out of the question. She’d inherited Mary and Les’ ruthless streak for getting her own way no matter at whose expense. It was sad, but already her girlish prettiness was fading. She had Mary’s hard-as-nails look. I wondered if her boyfriend Steve knew what he was in for. Poor sod. There was only one person I could speak to. Bruno. He was the only one who understood. On our walks twice a day, I’d tell him all my marital problems. He’d listen quietly like a marriage counsellor, giving a sympathetic wag of the tail every now and again. After going for my nightly marriage guidance session with Bruno, I was driving my car to meet Bob for a drink when my bleeper went off. I could see the blaze from half a dozen streets away, and hear the scream of fire appliances coming from all directions. I turned and drove towards Belford Street. Flames were shooting from the ceiling and windows of the DIY and garden centre and clouds of thick black smoke belched hundreds of yards into the sky. I counted at least seven fire appliances and more were arriving every few minutes. As I got out of the car I heard the roof tiles cracking. Sweaty-faced firefighters trained jets on the ground floor while another crew on a turntable ladder battled to douse the upper floor. Amid the shouted orders and roar of the fire, I heard windows smashing. High winds fanned the flames towards a compound containing cylinders and barrels. A crew blasted water on them to keep them cool. I was here as an observer so I kept out of the way. A crowd had gathered and was being kept well back behind a cordon by police officers. I panned the faces of the onlookers and settled on the features of Danny Bleacher. Suddenly there was a loud explosion. There was a collective gasp from the crowd and several people screamed. I tore my eyes away from Danny and back to the blaze in time to see a fireball shoot 100ft into the air like a rocket. Shouting broke out and firefighters ran for cover. I watched the fireball hurtle back towards the ground. It was one of the cylinders. It smashed onto the bonnet of a car, which exploded like a bomb had hit it. There were several smaller explosions as barrels overheated and ruptured, spewing out oil. Within seconds a river of burning oil ran down the street, exploding the petrol tanks of parked cars and melting their tyres as it went. Crews battled to hold back the flow as police evacuated residents from nearby houses. The air reeked with the acrid smell of burning rubber, kerosene, smoke and sweat. I watched the crews working to bring the blaze under control and felt proud to be one of them. I moaned about the pay and the long hours, but deep down I love the job. Politicians talk about cutting edge equipment and pioneering schemes, but at the end of the day it comes down to guts. ""I want everyone well back,"" I heard Divisional Officer Mike Leyland shout. ""The rest of those cylinders are going to go."" A weary fireman, who recognised me, shook his head and said: ""I hope there’s no bugger inside because they won’t stand a chance."" I looked at the blazing building. There wasn’t supposed to be anyone inside at this time of night. I prayed no one was. A fleet of ambulances stood by just in case. The media had turned up and several people with cameras ran around, trying to get the best shot. Then I saw someone being stretchered towards the nearest ambulance. My insides grew cold and tight as I recognized Mary. I bolted for the ambulance. ""That’s my wife,"" I screamed at the paramedics. A paramedic giving Mary oxygen looked at me, surprised. Mary put her hand up to stop the mask going over her face. ""Dad. Dad,"" her voice was a hoarse whisper. ""It's me Mary, Sam."" I was annoyed her first thought was of Les. The paramedic tried to put the mask back over her face but again her hand stopped him. ""Must tell Sam… "" ""We’ve got to get her to hospital,"" the paramedic insisted. ""Let me see her, please,"" I begged and sank to my knees beside the stretcher. I grasped one of her hands. Tears poured down her smoke-blackened face. She started to speak but her voice was growing weaker and I had to put my ear to her mouth. ""He said it was like a drug… "" she croaked. ""Followed him… "" She clutched weakly at my shirt with her free hand. My eyes flickered to the crowd and tried to pick out Danny Bleacher. But the police had pushed the cordon further back and the faces were just a blur. He'd said starting fires was like a drug. He'd also said he'd mended his ways. I had believed him but I guess a leopard doesn't change its spots. ""Tried to stop him… "" Mary whispered. Then her hand slid from my shirt and she was still. The paramedic took her pulse. ""Sorry, she’s gone,"" he said. ""NO!"" I grabbed the mask from the paramedic’s hand and put it over Mary’s face. ""Mary, Mary."" I looked at the paramedic praying he’d tell me she was going to be all right. His mouth was grim. He shook his head. I shut my eyes and our 25 years together flashed through my head like a movie on fast forward. Our first date, Mary so happy on our wedding day, the birth of Susan, all pink wrinkled skin and mop of black hair, Mary smiling and kissing me on just the right spot on the ear that was guaranteed to made me weak at the knees. She hadn’t done that for a long time. An unbearable ache surrounded my chest and I found it difficult to breath. Tears stung my eyes. I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked up into the paramedic’s face. ""Do you want to ride with her to the hospital?"" he asked. I stood up and shook my head. I don’t know how long I stood there. Time seemed to stand still. I never heard the ambulance take Mary’s body away or the clamour of the firefighting operation around me. I was suddenly seized with panic. I realised that despite our differences I still loved Mary. ""What am I going to do without you?"" I sobbed. My legs trembled and I felt like I was going to collapse. I felt light-headed and dizzy. I don’t know how long I stood like that. Suddenly I was jerked from my trance by a hand clawing at my shoulder. I turned and looked into Les’ blurred face. ""Sam, listen carefully,’ he said, his voice urgent. My brain refused to function. ""Sam are you listening? This is what happened. Mary was passing, she saw Danny Bleacher running from the factory and heard a scream from inside__"" I started to speak, but he waved an impatient hand. ""I won’t have Mary’s name dragged through the mud. I can’t afford any scandals so close to my retirement."" The fog in my head was lifting. I stared at him in disbelief. The man actually thought his own daughter was the arsonist. ""He’s scum,"" he said. ""Prison’s the best place for the likes of him."" He put a hand on my shoulder again. ""Now listen to me, Sam, this is what I want you to say. She heard a scream, she thought someone was trapped and she went in to rescue them."" His grip on my shoulder tightened. ""You owe me, Sam. If it weren’t for Mary and me you’d have been all washed up 10 years ago. Remember where your loyalties lie."" He was right. I did owe them. After splitting up from Sheila I had started to drink heavily. One day I was drunk on duty. An instant sacking offence. But Les had pulled strings and saved my job. He and Mary had held me to emotional blackmail ever since. It always amazed me how I had the guts to go into a blazing building but never had the balls to say no to Mary and Les. Take Sheila, for instance. I had loved Sheila, loved being with her. She made me feel like my old self. I should have fought for her. But it was easier to let her go. Less hassle. Les was growing impatient. ""Or are you going to be spineless, as usual?"" he hissed. I flinched like I’d been punched in the face. What hurt more was that it was true. He hadn’t tried to disguise the scorn in his voice. He despised me for not being like him, a ruthless, self-obsessed, arrogant bastard. He’d tolerated me all these years for Mary’ sake. Well, the feeling was mutual. ""If you don’t back me up, I’ll make sure you’re out of a job,"" he said, his steel grey eyes, flickering with anger. ""I’ve only a few months to go, but if it’s the last thing I do I’ll make sure you’re all washed up."" Tom Waugh, Delta’s station officer came up and coughed. ""Chief, the press know about your… eh… daughter. I don’t know how, sir, but they’ve heard. They want you to give an interview. Insensitive bastards. I’ve told them you’re too upset__"" ""It’s all right,"" Les said, interrupting him. ""Give me a minute to compose myself and I’ll be over."" Tom Waugh walked away. Les looked at me. ""Remember what I said."" I watched him walk towards the waiting group of reporters. My eyes swung towards the crowd of onlookers in time to see Danny being pushed into a car by two men I recognised as detectives. I looked back at Les. The reporters were all shouting questions at him at the same time. He put his hand up to quieten them. ""I’ve got a short statement to make,"" he told them. ""We’ve been able to piece together what happened from what my daughter told her husband, before… "" He paused and coughed. He was in full uniform and his brass buttons gleamed under the television camera lights. ""My daughter was a hero."" Our eyes locked over the reporters’ heads. His were cold, confident, knowing I would do exactly what he wanted, as usual. And he was right. I was spineless. I didn’t have the bottle to take him on. ""We’re proud of her,"" he said, giving the press his full attention once again. ""She was passing when she saw someone running from the burning factory. She was about to call the brigade when she heard a scream from inside and dashed in to try and mount a rescue. Tragically, she became trapped herself.’’ I felt sick. I shook my head and turned away. I was desperate for a drink. ""Firefighting has been my life,"" I heard Les continue, ""it’s been like a drug. Now I’m ready to retire."" I stopped dead. Mary’s words came back to me. ""He said it was like a drug."" I spun around to look at Les. ""Now, if you’ll excuse me I’ve matters of a personal nature to attend to,"" Les said. He gave a curt nod and walked away. A barrage of questions was fired after him. ""That’s all for now,"" Station Officer Waugh said, stepping forward. ""There’ll be a press conference in the morning."" I watched Les walk away. What sort of man was he, who’d send an innocent lad to prison to protect his bloody image? I knew he wanted to go out in a blaze of glory but I never dreamed he could be so ruthless. His words came back. ""You owe me, Sam. If it weren’t for Mary and me you’d have been all washed up 10 years ago. Remember where your loyalties lie."" I took a deep breath. I owed him nothing. For 25 bloody years I’d danced to his tune. No more. I couldn't prove it but I knew that Les had started the fires. And I'd find the evidence if it took me the rest of my life. My accusations would force the brigade to suspend him and carry out an investigation. Even if they cleared him, the mud would stick. The press pack was about to move off. I squared my shoulders and hurried over. I hadn’t felt so in-control in years. ""Before you go,"" I said, ""I’ve a statement of my own to make."" ",candidate00001
1,00002,candidate00001,"There he was again; motionless, like he was chiselled out of the stone that towered over the centre of the maze. He looked around 70 and despite the heatwave, wore the same raincoat buttoned tightly up to his chin. He stood in exactly the same spot, just as he had done every Sunday for the past month. Each week the feeling that I knew him from somewhere had grown, but I couldn’t remember where. He’d never spoken to me. In fact, he didn’t even seem to notice me. It was like he was locked in his own little world and I was invisible. Today I was in no rush to get back home, so I approached him. I coughed. ""Excuse me, but do I know you?"" Blank eyes looked at me. ""Leave me alone,"" he said in a dull voice. My face burned with embarrassment and anger. I turned to weave my way back along the winding green-walled path, but some instinct stopped me. Or was it because his voice sounded inexplicably familiar? ""Is there anything I can do?"" I asked for want of anything more imaginative to say. He was hunched in the shadow of the stone mound. ""Why do you want to know?"" He sounded disinterested as if he didn’t care if I answered or not. I didn’t know what to say. I groped for words. ""I sense… I sense you need help."" He looked at me for the first time. His eyes sharpened beneath erratic eyebrows. ""You’re right, I do need to tell someone,"" he said softly. ""But I warn you, you’ll probably think I’m mad."" His attempt at a smile failed. ""I’ve lost my soul,"" he said simply. I looked at him bewildered. ""That’s why I come here, hoping to find it again."" I don’t know what I expected… not this… it was too weird. I shook my head and turned away. ""Don’t go,"" he cried, clutching my wrist with icy fingers. ""I didn’t mean to frighten you. I told you, didn’t I? I said you’d think I was mad."" ""I don’t think you’re mad,"" I lied, avoiding his gaze. My eyes fixed on his scuffed black brogues with the laces undone. ""But I don’t know how I can help you."" He released my wrist. ""Just listen,"" he pleaded, ""that’s all I ask."" I nodded without replying. I wanted to run but he sounded so wretched, a voice in my head told me to hear him out. ""It happened so long ago. More than 50 years. You wouldn’t think to look at this place now,"" he gestured with a bony hand to the neglected hedges, overgrown and sagging, and the graffiti that daubed the maze’s granite boulder centrepiece, ""but it used to be lovely. For years it’s been abandoned. I used to come here every Sunday afternoon with my wife Mary. She used to make us a picnic and we would lay a cloth on the grass outside."" His sad face brightened at the memory. ""It’s a mess now, but it used to have beautiful flower beds."" I looked around trying to visualise this forsaken place echoing with the laughter of picnicking families. ""My world stopped one particular Sunday."" The lines that streaked his face ran deep, like the fissures etched in the stone. ""We’d finished our picnic and went for a walk through the maze. We knew it so well, we could have found our way in and out blindfolded. Mary wanted to climb the boulder and see what the view was like from up there. I told her it was too high, too dangerous. I was tidying away the picnic things when I heard a scream. When I looked up Mary was hanging from the rock by her fingertips. She’d climbed up while I wasn’t looking."" His lip trembled. ""I scrambled up as fast as I could."" I’m frightened of heights and as I looked at the bleak stone, I felt the hairs rise on the back of my neck. His grey haunted eyes remained locked on the stone as he continued. ""I can still see the relief in her eyes when she saw me. I leaned over as far as I could. My arm was stretching out of its socket. My hand only inches away. I reached even further. I shouted to her to grab my hand. She tried. Oh God… "" He sobbed and dashed a bloodless hand through his lank grey hair. ""She made no sound but I could see tears running down her lovely face."" His voice sank to a whisper and I strained to catch his words. ""Then her face twisted with terror as her hands slipped and fell. I lost my balance and toppled over the side after her."" My breath caught in my throat. ""Have you heard of people who’ve had near death experiences?"" He was calmer now. ""Yes, I’ve read about it,"" I replied, giving him an uneasy look. ""Mary died in the fall. I lay beside her. I knew I was seriously injured, but I didn’t care. I was angry with Mary for climbing the mound, angry with myself because I couldn’t save her and angry with God for allowing it to happen."" He paused and took a long deep breath, then said: ""That’s when I died."" I stared at him aghast. ""I’m not mad,"" he said quickly. ""It’s true. Please let me finish,"" he implored. I wanted to tear myself away but couldn’t. And reluctantly nodded. ""All my pain disappeared."" His eyes, huge in his chalky face, burned into mine. ""There was a bright light in the distance. It drew nearer and nearer, until it bathed me in a luminescent glow."" Icy fingers of sweat crept over my body as I listened. ""I had a wonderful feeling of peace,"" he went on, his eyes shining with an intense light. ""I could see my broken body below as I floated in a bubble of shimmering light."" His voice got higher and he spoke faster. I was frightened but unable to pull my eyes from his hypnotic gaze. ""I was being pulled along a tunnel to the source of the light,"" he said, breathlessly. ""It was glorious. Two Beings of Light were waiting to greet me, and Mary was standing between them. I’d almost reached the source, when a voice said I must go back. It wasn’t my time."" He reached out and grabbed my sleeve. ""I didn’t want to. I had no choice. I was sent."" My heart ached for this stranger. ""When I woke in hospital, I was angry, angrier than I’ve ever been."" His face was grim. ""I didn’t want to be here. I felt I didn’t belong. I wanted to be with Mary."" I took a deep breath. ""I’ve read that when people are given a second chance, life becomes precious,"" I said, trying to reassure him and give him a crumb of comfort. ""Mary wouldn’t want you to be unhappy. She’d want___"" His eyes blazed. ""Life’s empty without Mary. I don’t belong."" I didn’t know what to say to ease his pain. ""I don’t understand,"" I said, feebly. ""That Sunday, I didn’t die but my soul never returned. It somehow became trapped in this maze."" His bone-white hands, criss-crossed with blue veins, trembled. ""I don’t know how. All I know is I’m alive, but this body… "" he pointed down at himself, ""is just a shell. Every Sunday afternoon I come here, hoping… "" his voice cracked. ""I’m in limbo,"" he said, ""detached… floundering between two worlds… belonging to neither."" ""I want to help you, but I don’t know how?"" ""When I recognised you, I knew you would."" ""What… "" my voice trembled, ""what do you mean?"" ""Remember the Beings of Light at the end of the tunnel."" I nodded. ""You were with them."" ""I… I don’t understand."" ""You’re Mary."" I put my hand to my mouth and looked at him in horrified disbelief. Then turned and ran. ""Please, come back."" His cry echoed after me as I fled the maze. All week at work I couldn’t forget him. I read every thing I could on near death experiences and reincarnation, but couldn’t find the answers to the questions that twirled in my head like washing in a dryer. Could I have been Mary? Is that why he was so familiar to me? Is that why I’m frightened of heights, because I fell from one in another life? I told myself I was being ridiculous. I’d found the maze by accident. It was neglected and not very interesting. I had far better things to do with my Sundays but for some reason I couldn’t fathom, I kept going back week after week. Now I was wondering if it hadn’t been an accident after all. What if destiny had drawn me there. But I was determined not to go back again. Then when Sunday afternoon came around, I couldn’t settle. All I could think of was the old man in the maze, longing to be with his Mary. The following week was the same. I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep. I was a mess, a wreck. My behaviour was the last straw for Joe. For months he’d been asking me to marry him. I was happy just living together. I was so fixated on the old man that I hardly noticed he’d left. My obsession took over everything. I thought about the old man every second. I knew I had to help him. I found out all I could about the maze and made a startling discovery. The stone came from a quarry where there’d been a murder, almost a century ago. The following Sunday I returned to the maze. The old man was there as I knew he would be. He looked different, not so neglected. His clothes were still much the worse for wear but his untidy hair had been cut and was neatly combed. His laces were still undone but his shoes had been buffed to a high shine. I told him what I’d found. ""What if your soul is trapped by the tormented spirit of the man who was murdered?"" ""I don’t know what you mean?"" he whispered in confusion. ""I’m not an expert. But just say, when the stone was brought here from the quarry, the victim’s ghost… spirit… whatever you want to call it, came with it."" He still looked puzzled. I pressed on. ""It might be lonely and so trapped your soul for company."" His raincoat was too big for his shrunken frame and hung on him like a canvas tent. There was a crust of blood on his chin where he’d nicked himself shaving. The razor-raw pain was still in his eyes, eating my insides. Night after night over the past two weeks I’d reconstructed the events of that tragic Sunday. I’d seen Mary’s tears and terror-twisted face. I prayed my wild plan would work. ""I’ve an idea,"" I told him. ""If we take some of the stone back to the quarry, the ghost may go back with it."" ""What good would that do? I still won’t have my Mary,"" he persisted. His cheerless face was so pinched, red-hot tears stung my eyes. ""I know, "" I said sadly ""But it may let you be reunited with your soul. It has to be better than living like this… in limbo."" There was such torment in his eyes. I put my arms around his fleshless shoulders and hugged him. The smell of Brylcream tickled my nostrils. ""I don’t understand any of this,"" I said in a low voice, ""but I know I was meant to help you. Let’s try."" My eyes implored him. ""Please."" Reluctantly he agreed. We came back that night with the pickaxe, I’d borrowed. He was too weak, so I had to do it. It was tough but determination gave me strength. We took a large chunk of stone to the quarry. I’m not religious, but as we stood in that desolate place I said a little prayer. I hoped it would help both these suffering spirits. ""What now?"" he asked when we got back in the maze. ""Lie down exactly where you were after you fell."" He didn’t move. ""It can’t do any harm. Please,"" I urged. His eyes softened as he looked at me. ""First I want you to have this for trying to help me."" He handed me a gold locket. ""I gave it to Mary on our wedding day. She’d want you to have it. We’d planned to have children and I know she would have loved a daughter like you."" He patted my face and I caught his fragile hand in mine, squeezing it gently. ""Whatever happens my dear it’s been a pleasure meeting you,"" he added. I couldn’t answer for the tears choking me. I watched him lie down. He closed his eyes and lay still. Nothing happened, then as I watched, his face became illuminated and transformed, wiping away all traces of pain and despair. He looked 50 years younger. He raised his arms as if in welcome, gave a gasp and was still. I hurried over and felt for a pulse. There wasn’t one. There was a look of utter peace on his face. He was reunited with his soul and his beloved Mary. Tears of sorrow and joy rolled down my face. I felt I’d lost part of myself but I was grateful for the short time I’d had with him. It had changed my life. I now knew why I was frightened to commit to Joe. I loved him too much. I had some unexplainable fear that I’d lose him. Now I was ready to say ""yes"", if he’d have me. I brushed the old man’s thin face with my lips, fastened his shoelaces, then opened the heart-shaped locket. Inside were two black and white pictures. One was the old man as the young handsome newlywed I’d imagined him to be. The other was a picture of the woman who had haunted my dreams - my grandmother’s twin sister. I'd never known her. She had died tragically young and I never knew the circumstances. But for some unknown reason from being very little I had always felt drawn to her. Maybe because I was named after her and older members of the family said I reminded them of her. Slowly I walked home and reported finding the body to the police. ",candidate00001
2,00001,candidate00002,"The sudden silence halted his struggle against the weight pinning him. With his left arm trapped by its weight, he couldn’t gain the leverage to move the cabinet. The growing numbness in his legs, also pinned, offered scant hope that they’d be joining the effort. As the last sound of battle choked away in the next room, his gaze swept around as much of his surroundings as his limited vantage allowed. Night had barely begun to fall, yet the place was shrouded in shadows, along with the layers of dust or dirt, the heavy curtains set to keep the place dark through the daylight hours. His own weapon had skidded out of reach, and those of the fallen he could make out in the dull light were all too far away. He had a stake still in his belt, but on the wrong side, out of reach. Even as his gaze swept over the bodies surrounding him, he knew he’d spot no signs of life, or movement, from them. Both his team and their prey lay strewn about, their strategy having gone bad quicker than he’d have thought possible. While they’d tried to adapt when they realised they were expected, it had already been too late. He briefly considered changing himself, the greater strength of his wolf form increasing his chances of his freeing himself, but being so new to all this, he knew he’d lack the necessary control when he changed, and worried that the wolf would just lash out blindly, damaging itself as much as the cabinet. But if the survivor of the fight next door proved not to be one of his, he may have little choice. His eyes fixed on the doorway now occupied by the survivor, a shape which didn’t bring any relief. The outlines of a long coat drifted behind as it stepped into the less murky darkness, identifying the form as definitely not being a member of his team. It moved towards him with a casual step, taking a roundabout path, but he knew he was the target of the stranger’s attention, so playing dead would do no good. He tensed, hurriedly running through his dwindling options, giving the cabinet a final, fruitless, shove. “Is da poor widdle doggy twapped?” The voice held an aloof amusement at his struggle, which immediately set his nerves further on edge. Abandoning his attempt to shift the cabinet, he focussed his attention on the figure’s movements. “Don’t bother trying to rise, Jason.” The man glided closer, his elegant movements a match for his tone. “I assure you there’s no need for formality.” Jason didn’t bother hiding his suspicion. “Yes,” said the looming figure. “I know who you are. I’m an old friend of your father.” A dubious glare greeted this proclamation. The stranger inclined his head slightly. “Well, maybe not friend, but we did try to kill each other on a fairly regular basis.” Smiling, he sat near Jason’s prone position, offering the first real view of his face. The features confirmed the suspicions his words had raised. “Adam Vaage.” Adam inclined his head in greeting. “A pleasure to finally make your acquaintance.” Jason stayed silent, his gaze flickering to the blade twirling between Adam’s fingers. What he could make out of the carvings on its ebon hilt matched those he’d seen in pictures of it, and the faintly curved blade glinted a threatening shade of silver. “I suppose you’re wondering…” Adam glanced about as he began speaking, and Jason took advantage of the apparent distraction to dart his hand for the knife, just within reach. Adam didn’t even glance back as his grip on the weapon instantly shifted, its blade snapping around to greet Jason’s hand. His hand flinched back, and Jason held back his pain as best he could, the sting of the slash cascaded into a jolt of agony as the silver boiled his blood where it cut. It took a moment to suppress the waves of agony as the burning slowly died away. Looking up, he saw Adam finish his survey and glance down at him with a wearied smile. “If you’ve quite gotten that out of your system? Good. Now please don’t worry, I have no intention of doing anything to you. Not at this time, leastways. I’d hardly have invited you here if I did, now would I?” “You invited us!?” Jason made no attempt to hide his doubt. “Who do you think gave your people the tip about this nest of unaffiliated vampires?” Jason glanced about at the dead, or rather inanimate, vampires. Their clothes and generally shabby appearance were a marked contrast to Adam. “This wasn’t your nest. You didn’t have anything to do with them, did you?” “Oh, please don’t mistake me for one of these suckers? Living… here?” He glanced about again, with obvious distaste. “I didn’t mistake you for something living anywhere.” A more genuine smile greeted him this time. “No, I had nothing to do with them, other than selecting them as a suitable target for your people, and warning them of your attack a couple of minutes beforehand.” “Why?” “Why set them up, or why tip them off?” “Either.” “To allow us to meet, of course.” His bewilderment openly displayed, Jason took a moment before replying. “And now that we’ve met? What are you going to do to me?” “Do to you?” False shock overwhelmed him. “Why, whatever kind of monster must you take me for?” “A blood-sucking abomination of nature.” An indifferent shrug conceded the point. “Who has no intention of doing anything other than leaving you for your back-up units to rescue.” “So why go to all this trouble?” Adam met his gaze before looking about again. “You know, I do miss your father. Did he ever tell you about our fights?” “No.” Adam glanced back at Jason. “Never?” Jason kept his tone steady, but couldn’t quite hide his unease at the path of the conversation. “No.” Adam shrugged. “I enjoyed those. It is so rare to find a decent enemy these days. Someone you can actually respect. Then he met your mother, left the life, became a…” he glanced up, searching for the word. “Pedestrian, I suppose. And he died a pedestrian death.” He dropped his gaze to meet Jason’s. “Of that I am truly sorry.” Keeping his features firmly fixed, Jason offered no response. “So then I hear that you’ve joined the Hunt, and I just knew I had to meet you, to see whether you could possibly live up to your father.” He ran a disappointedly appraising glance over Jason. “But I suppose you are still new to the game, so I’ll give you some time to grow into it.” Rising, Adam looked down at Jason. “So, what? Because you and my father were enemies, now we are, too?” “Oh, we’re not enemies, Jason. Not yet, anyway. We’ve only just met, and I’ve yet to find something admirable about you.” “Admirable?” “Of course. One must always admire something about one’s enemies. Otherwise they’re not really enemies. They’re just obstacles.” With a smile he turned to leave. “That’s it?” Jason glanced around. “Everyone here killed, or rekilled, just so we could meet?” “And for the fun of it.” Adam flashed a grin as he turned and strode away. “You be a good little doggy now.” Jason bit back a retort as Adam faded into the darkened doorway, the sound of his departure quickly overwhelmed by that of the back-up team moving through the building. The wolf fought for release. He felt it struggling against his hold as his mind embraced the change. A torrent of rage broke against him, and he strained to keep it in check, to maintain his focus. Running through the meditation techniques he’d been taught, he found the waves of sheer aggression almost too overwhelming, always clawing for his attention. Uncertain of his ability to hold it back any longer, he released his grip on the change and pushed the wolf back down inside. He forced his mental processes to calm, recalling happier memories to help his mind relax. Inevitably, he went back to the time before he’d been forced into this world, when he was still in college, with Sophia. His thoughts calmer, he pushed the memory away, intending to find a new memory with which to relax himself next time. This one just reminded him too much of what he’d had to leave behind. Opening his eyes, Jason realized he’d been shaking with the strain, and noticed the sweat trickling over him. Taking a deep breath to calm himself, he suppressed his irritation. Coming so late to this, he lacked the control those more experienced with the techniques could manage, so he couldn’t safely assume the full wolf form without the rage taking over, let alone manage the more useful hybrid stage. His lack of control made him a liability on intensive combat missions, so he’d found himself generally limited to investigative jobs. Which held a certain interest, but he still felt as though he should be doing more. Stretching his back and neck, he turned as he heard movement at the doorway, the sounds of the pubic part of the building drifting through. Ostensibly a gym, serving the nearby financial district, the Clans owned the place, and at least a third of the floor space was restricted for their use, either single exercise rooms like this, or larger ones for group combat training. Having recognized his uncle’s barely discernible tread before he turned to regard him, Jason eased himself to his feet, coming to attention. “Jason.” Robert Miller came to a stop just before the practice mats. He exchanged a cursory nod with the trainer seated off to Jason’s side, the taser at hand as he supervised the exercise. Jason no longer found himself as put off by the presence as he initially had. Everyone had to have a supervisor when learning the control exercises, and he found the presence now eased his concerns that he’d lose control of the change. The anxiety itself seemed to make concentrating on his control harder, so after the first few sessions the supervisor had become a reassuring safety net, rather than an imposing observer. Robert focussed his attention on Jason, a quick glance seeming to take in how the session had gone. “I have a job for you. I’m afraid it’s urgent, so I’ll need you to cut short the session.” Jason nodded. “Should I grab a quick shower first or do you want to brief me here?” “Get cleaned up and presentable, but don’t take too long. I’ve got a car with me and I’ll brief you on the way. I’ll wait outside.” Robert said nothing as Jason entered the car, waiting until he’d pulled them into the flow of traffic before turning to his nephew. “Have you heard about Councillor Reilly?” Jason gave a slight nod. “I heard he was found dead this morning. There’s a rumour going around he was murdered. Someone said it could have been a vamp, but that kind of claim isn’t exactly unusual.” Robert grimaced. “He was found dead early this morning. It looks like murder. But there’s nothing I’m aware of to indicate vampires, so please don’t go repeating the rumour. In fact, since you’ll be investigating, you should keep any information about the murder between us.” Jason nodded. “Will it just be me looking into it?” “You’ll be lead. How much do you know about Reilly?” “He was a Council member. And a businessman. He ran some of the Clan’s companies. That’s about it, I think. I don’t know that I’ve ever met him.” “Probably not.” Robert glanced at Jason. “He was also heavily involved in the peace talks.” A definite hint of something seemed to flick across Jason’s eyes at this. “Peace talks in which the Council are heavily invested, and which they wish to see continue, so this murder is highly politically charged, and needs to be resolved quickly, hopefully without too many rumours spreading about vampire involvement.” “And if there turns out to be vampire involvement?” Robert exhaled slowly. “Then we’ll deal with that when it occurs, but I need you to approach the case with an open mind. I don’t want you going into this looking for a vampire killer.” He pulled a folder from beside his seat and handed it over. Taking it, Jason nodded, opening it and scanning the contents. Robert had hoped his relative newness to this world would give Jason less inbred animosity toward vampires than others he could have assigned, but there were increasingly larger elements of the clans who had more certain views towards their ancestral enemy, and he wasn’t too sure how much of an influence they may have over Jason. There were probably a few members of the Hunt who shared those views, anyway. Nevertheless, he didn’t expect the following news to be greeted too warmly. “Due to the nature of the current political situation, you’ll have to work alongside an agent from the other side of the talks.” Jason’s eyes barely flickered as he met Robert’s, but there’d definitely been something there. “You mean a vampire!?” “Yes.” “Why? If this doesn’t have anything to do with…” “Because the Councils have decided that this investigation deserves close scrutiny, due to the potentially explosive effect rumours could have if allowed free rein. We don’t need premature retaliatory strikes setting off another war, so the situation is to be closely supervised.” Jason turned to stare out the window. “Who am I working with, then? Someone from the Order?” “Not sure, but I don’t think so. They’ll just be there to observe, and I suspect the Order will have someone else conducting their own investigation out of sight, so if the killer does turn out to be one of them, they’ll hope to get to them first.” “That’s assuming their Council isn’t behind it and haven’t already cleared away any incriminating evidence.” “Assuming that, yes. Still, working with them means we get access to the vampire Council’s assets in the police, so we’ll get their findings quickly, and they’ll be prompted to treat this as a priority case. We’ll also get access to the murder scene.” Jason looked back to the file in his hands. “Do we know if he had any business enemies from outside the communities?” “None that I know of, but I’ll be debriefing some of the senior staff, and I’ll let you know if that raises anything relevant. Although he did apparently have a loud disagreement with one of his associates, just yesterday morning. Leonard Markham, the Director of Acquisitions and Mergers at the company. I’ve got him available for questioning by you, along with Reilly’s secretary, Michelle Grant. They’re both of the Clans.” “Do we have anything else on Markham?” “Nothing of note. What we do have is towards the back,” he gestured offhandedly to the file, “but I’ve skimmed it and nothing there seems particularly relevant. I can have people look at his accounts and background, if you think it worth doing after speaking to him.” Jason nodded, without looking up. “Just those two I’m talking to?” “Given that the company has certain interests in common with those of our fanged friends, the Council are reluctant to have many members of staff questioned in the presence of a potential commercial spy. We’ll have others questioned in-house.” With a snort, Jason turned his attention back to the notes. “So am I just investigating for PR purposes?” “No, you’re the lead. Consider this freeing up your time for the main avenues of investigation. I can also assign manpower to any other areas you want looked at.” “Why me? For something this high profile wouldn’t you be better assigning someone more experienced?” “You’re a good investigator. Apart from which you’re diplomatic…” “Diplomatic?!” “Poker-faced may be a better description. You can keep your cool and keep your feelings hidden, and you’re more even-tempered than some. Since this investigation could lead anywhere in our communities, I need someone who can work it without treading on too many toes than is necessary. Plus, someone more experienced could well have previously made enemies with people you’ll need to talk to. Discrete investigations aren’t exactly what we’re used to.” Jason nodded his acceptance of the reasoning. “What about Reilly’s personal life. Anything not covered by this?” He nudged the file. “Single, I don’t believe he had any long-term relationships, but he enjoyed socializing, and being seen out and about at the big events and popular clubs.” After a quick glance out the window, Jason looked at Robert. “Where are we going? I thought he was murdered at home?” “He was. But the police are all over it at the moment, and since that’s where any forensic evidence would be, it was decided to let their people get what they can from it first.” “Decided by the vampire Council, I assume?” Robert gave a reluctant nod. “So by the time we get there, any scent the killer may have left could be totally obscured.” Robert shrugged. “The police labs will treat the evidence as a priority, and they should be cleared out in time for you to go in soon. Hopefully soon enough to preserve any scents. For the moment, though, we’ll meet Chryles and your new partner at Reilly’s office. We get first look at that.” Jason nodded, closing the folder and putting it aside. “Anything else I should know?” “Just one thing. You’ll be coming over for dinner on Sunday, investigation allowing.” He offered a sheepish shrug of apology. “Mariah insists. You missed Ariadne’s piano recital due to a mission, and she insists on doing a repeat performance for her favourite cousin.” Jason smiled as he turned his attention back to the file. The elevator deposited them onto a mainly deserted floor of offices, a security guard solemnly letting them pass once he’d checked their IDs. A combination of windows and clouded glass, the place felt as though it was intended to be artistic, but Jason just found it irritating. The unnatural quiet blanketing the place didn’t help, as though its corridors were used to far more traffic during the daylight hours. But the floor had been ordered shut off until the police could get to it. A nod from the guard towards the main office at the far end of a long corridor indicated where they’d find company, and the hint of distaste on his face gave a good indication as to the nature of the parties present. Jason walked silently alongside Robert, both composing themselves for the approaching interaction, as they caught faint glimpses of figures through the partly open doorway up ahead. The scents seemed obscured, as though their guests had taken steps to mask themselves out of respect for heightened senses of smell. But there remained a hint of the too-familiar aroma of undeath, which could never quite be hidden. The smell of long-dried death could be tolerated with practice, but it always seemed to put any of the Clan on edge, as though some genetic memory from their ancestors recognized the threat it presaged. He thought he picked up something else mixed with it, something vaguely familiar, but he couldn’t place it. Something about it just felt out of place. He’d only caught a brief whiff, though, barely enough to hold in his mind, so he returned his attention to his mental preparations. The whisper of muted conversation drifted out to meet them, and Jason’s superior hearing soon identified the irritatingly superior tones of Chryles as he lectured his associate. The talking died down as Chryles stepped into view of the open gap between the doors, favouring them with an indifferent nod of greeting. Under the aloof gaze, Jason surreptitiously ran through some breathing techniques, determined to hold his temper, and disgust, in check, and to maintain his composure while in their presence. He hoped the investigation wouldn’t take too long, whatever it uncovered, as he didn’t want to cause any political problems by killing his ‘partner’. He shortened his stride to allow Robert to enter the room first, following behind and coming to a stop alongside him. Chryles' associate turned as they entered, but her scent hit Jason with a torrent of memories before he even saw her face. “Misters Miller,” said Chryles, his tone a slow drawl as he enunciated each word, with no attempt at injecting his voice with any hint of warmth. “May I introduce…” “Sophia!?” Jason couldn’t keep the shock from his voice as his practised calm abandoned him, his face betraying a surprise almost equalled by hers.

3,00002,candidate00002,"Fire really shouldn't take so long to get going, should it? It had been dry a few hours now, yet his opponent had been tending the valuable pile he'd brought with him for five minutes, and Danath was growing anxious to get on with the duel. Or anxious to see whether his opponent could do as the rumours claimed. Focussing on calming his nerves, Danath glanced around the small, roughly circular, plateau. Barely fifty paces wide, with most sides almost sheer. The side they'd ascended had been an awkward climb from sea level, almost forty feet below. Roughly flat, with only a few patches of rock jutting up, its floor of solid stone lay on a slight incline, and the only signs of vegetation covered the sides near the water, becoming sporadic further up. A cool breeze wafted in, and he turned to squint at the sun, letting it wash over his dark skin. Just short of six foot, his lean, muscled form hid behind the loose-fitting trousers and long sleeved grey vest he preferred for duelling. Rain may have offered him an advantage, but potentially less of a challenge, so he was happy it had dried out. Never losing track of his opponent's movements, he scanned the horizon, which offered a small number of similar peaks jutting out of the sea to varying heights. And, of course, Melmyrn, his home city, floating nearby. Its path had been diverted here for this duel, so that Thortus could watch from afar. When the fire finally reached a decent size, his opponent stood, looking defiant. The man had arrived only a day ago, from the distant flaming islands of Tloth, and immediately challenged Danath. Apparently he'd killed the man's friend in an earlier Stoneweaving duel. Not that he'd recognized the name, or even remembered it now. Come to think of it, he couldn't recall this one's name. Tezal? Terzar? He felt sure it had a 't' and a 'z' in there somewhere. Never mind. His interest lay in what the man would allegedly use. Not that he'd have turned down a duel, anyway. As champion he had to accept all challenges, and probably would have done regardless, simply for the thrill. But tradition meant that the loser would forfeit the stone used to the winner, and the base word if they didn't know it, so here he could actually gain something, other than just a valuable stone. The inhabitants of the Tloth region had supposedly learned which gemstone and word allowed them to control fire, though they remained understandably secretive with the knowledge. But now an opportunity to learn it had fallen into his lap, and he didn't intend to lose it. The man, Danath decided to think of him as Tezal, pulled a gemstone from inside his shirt. It shone a translucent reddish orange, and looked a bit like a tade, a gemstone he'd only seem pictures of. He couldn't quite recall its history, but suspected they'd now only be found in the Tloth region. Tossing the gemstone into the fire, Tezal said something Danath couldn't hear, and the fire shifted. Slowly at first, awkwardly, as though controlling it took effort, which he could understand. It appeared far more erratic than the stone and metal Danath usually used. It stood, coalescing into a vaguely human shape, flickering and flinching with disconcerting irregularity as it grew, rapidly consuming the fuel used to start it. Tezal stood up behind it, waiting with a glare. So he wouldn't be wearing it. Unsurprising, really, but Danath had held out hope it could be controlled enough to direct its heat away from the wielder. Turning away, he withdrew the dark red gemstone, a dett, and placed it on a nearby outcropping of stone. ""Luxthor"", he said, and felt an awareness of the stone flood his mind. It contained a few flecks of metal, but not enough to matter, and responded easily to his thoughts. Normally he used his favoured block of iron for duels, but against fire, stone seemed a wiser choice. Also, animating your weapon before a duel was considered poor manners, so he'd have had to lug it up here, which sounded too much like real work. The stone animated into a human shape, and he turned as it approached, stepping into the hollow area within, which sealed with a thought. Only a couple of slits remained open for him to see, and to let in air. He flexed, aligning the thoughts sent to his muscles with those going to his armour. Satisfied, he nodded to Tezal, whose fiery avatar advanced with erratic grace. Moving forwards, Danath remained uncertain how to deal with it. The gemstone powering it appeared to offer the only solid matter he could see within, so it apparently didn't need any other fuel. Did it still require air? Trying to smother it may be an option, probably his initial one. The tade seemed relatively unprotected within the flames, but he didn't want to risk destroying it if he could avoid doing so, and removing it, even if he knew the word and could touch it with his flesh, would be illegal in a duel. As they closed, the thing leapt forward, engulfing his armour in flames, and he barely closed the eyeholes in time, feeling a wave of heat crashing into his eyes. He felt the thing grappling his carapace with its gossamer grasp, holding on firmly. Its heat pulsed through his link to the stone, but distantly, more as a concept than a sensation, and he sensed slight cracks beginning to greet it along his shell. Not enough to cause a problem yet. Certainly not before the lack of air would be an issue. Grabbing the evasive form, he fell forward, unable to avoid a jolt from falling onto stone, no matter how well he controlled it. His opponent's avatar tried slipping out from under him, but he rolled around, fighting to keep it pinned, trying to grind it into the ground. It slipped free, though, shooting to his left. Rolling to the right, Danath scrambled to his feet, risking a quick opening of his eye slits, as much for air as to spot his enemy. It charged him again. Taking a deep breath, he sealed the slits before it hit, the force of the impact a strong gust of wind rather than a solid collision. Rolling with the blow, he dragged it to the ground again, but again it slipped through his grasp, clambering on top of him this time. He rolled over, but it always managed to stay on top, and he realized he didn't know how near the edge they'd gotten. They'd first clashed near the middle of the peak, and the last glimpse showed more than half its width in front of him, but they'd turned away from there. He'd better not risk moving much further until he got his bearings. The fall probably wouldn't kill him, but he couldn't know how far under water he'd have to go to extinguish the thing, and whether his air would last. Twisting to his feet, the stone shell matching his fluid grace, he flung the flaming avatar aside, expelling the surface layer of his stone avatar after it to push it away, and opening the slits as he did. The fiery creature stumbled around ten strides away, both of them around ten strides from the edge of the peak. A quick glance found Tezal over to the left, around twenty strides away. Charging his true opponent, Danath caught a moment of panic in Tezal's eyes before his concentration deepened, and knew the fiery avatar would be racing to intercept, as Tezal scrambled around to use it as cover. Glancing back at the avatar while maintaining his charge, Danath found it closing faster than he'd have liked. No matter how well he managed to merge with it, running in stone remained an exertion, both physical and mental, which had begun to take its toll. No doubt Elgren would put it down to too little practice. Nevertheless, the flaming avatar would catch him before he could reach Tezal. Time to see how well Tezal handled multiple fights, then. Opening the front of the avatar as he ran, Danath sprang from it as he directed it to change course directly at Tezal's avatar. He slowed to a walk as his mind adjusted to the two of them no longer moving in synch, and he had to keep the avatars in sight to direct the fight. Still backing away, Tezal looked flustered as he glanced between Danath and the clashing avatars. The flaming avatar tried slipping around, but found its path always blocked, its stony opponent flowing as it tried to grapple and smother the flames, no longer limited to a human shape. Danath charged Tezal, keeping the pressure on. Both had short blades drawn, Danath's iron, and Tezal's looking vaguely coppery. Tezal's attention focussed entirely on Danath's approach now, as he tensed to meet him. His eyes adopted a puzzled look as Danath slowed merely steps away, and he only just managed to dive away from the pair of avatars, as Danath's charged through where Tezal had been standing with the fiery one in its grasp, continuing over the edge. While he didn't like to risk losing the tade, Danath had no idea how skilled Tezal would be with a sword, so the distraction seemed the smartest way to end this. Spinning back to his feet, Tezal danced away from where his enemy had been, but not fast enough, as Danath caught his sword hand in a firm grip, holding it in place as his own blade found Tezal's throat. They remained poised as Danath's attention split back to their avatars. They'd reached the water by that point, and he could feel the faint pressure all around his stone surrogate, merging with flailing streams of heat from the other's dying struggles. He had his avatar stretch its arms into a scoop beneath the fading thing, and relief washed over him as something drifted onto it. The gemstone secured, he began the avatar's ascent from the water. Tezal's face showed his defeat, and he didn't struggle as Danath took his weapon, and directed him towards the edge of the plateau, from where he could see and direct the ascent of his avatar as it cleared the water. His attention split, Danath faced Tezal. ""What's the base word?"" With obvious reluctance, Tezal replied. ""Thir."" ""Thir,"" said Danath, as he held Tezal's eyes. He could see the certainty of a doomed man in them. Which changed to confusion as Danath slid his blade into its scabbard, turning from his defeated opponent, to meet his avatar as it returned. Obviously he hadn't expected to survive losing a fight. But Danath had no reason to kill him now. Why did people always expect that of him? He killed when paid to. Or when a duel went that far. But with his opponent's avatar beaten he'd won, so had no need to kill. If he went killing anyone at any time, people may get the idea they didn't have to bother paying him all that much, and then he may actually have to get a proper job. No way did he intend to let that happen. ",candidate00002
4,00001,candidate00003,"“What's so important that I have to miss my daily dose of Kiwi drama?!” came the voice as he strode into the underground bunker-like room. Weekdays at 7pm – straight after the news was time for Shortland Street, NZ's longest running TV 'soap'. John Key didn't actually watch it, but he thought it was a suitable joking jibe for these guys who were taking up his evening time. As Prime Minister of New Zealand, he didn't get much free time, so reminding people who called 'special' meetings at odd hours was fair game he thought. “Sorry Sir” answered the older of the two men waiting for him in the small room, “You'll soon see the circumstances warrant this degree of disruption and security.” Jerry Mateparae was a veteran of politics and a man at the top of his game. Prior to his very recent appointment as head of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), NZ's communications monitoring operation a few months ago, he had come through a long chain of ever increasingly senior and more 'political' appointments in the NZ Army. A long way from his roots as an enlisted private in the Army's Regular Forces, Jerry had subsequently passed through Officer training, and the elite Special Air Services, before climbing through the various 'chain of command' roles to become Chief of the Army, and then Chief of Defense Force. And then the Prime Minister had announced his appointment to the GCSB Director role, a post he had taken up at the start of February, only to have himself announced as the Governor General elect one month later! Jerry was a solder's soldier – and in the couple of month at GCSB he had had quite an effect on the way things were done. He also had an ingrained sense of duty and hierarchy, and as his current boss came fully into the room, he stood and indicated the chair in front of him, then motioned to the other occupant of the room to get the door. The younger man sealed the door and came back to the table, seating himself beside his boss and facing the PM. Apart from the three men, their chairs and the table, the room was empty, bar the slim red-jacketed manila folder on the table between them. John looked at the third man and Jerry made the introductions. “Sir, this is one of my Special Projects Managers. He reports directly to me. You can call him Fin. His surname is need to know.” “Even for me?!” the PM asked incredulously. “Yes Sir, even for you.” Jerry agreed quietly, trying to avoid any tone of defiance in his voice. It wasn't strictly necessary, but Jerry had learned a long time back in his Army life that loyalty will follow more easily when reflected by the boss. But also, he felt that in these more 'political' roles, he should have some 'rules of engagement' for when his Department was dealing externally, and this was one of his rules – more to prove a point than for any need for secrecy to keep his people safe. Although in the case of the Special Projects Operatives, the need was greater than for most people. Special Projects blurred the line between traditional GCSB roles and other departments' roles. Fin reached out his hand to shake with John Key and said “It's a pleasure to meet you Sir.” John returned the handshake and got straight down to business. “What have you got for me then?” he asked as he slid the folder towards himself but not yet opening it until the unwritten protocol of this type of briefing allowed. This type of briefing was very unusual. The underground SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) meeting room was only ever used for those meetings that never happened. The kind of meeting that doesn't show up on your meeting schedule program and that you only know is going to happen when you see that yellow chalk “X” on the right-side rear tyre of your car. The unnatural looking “X” that has crossbars on the ends of the cross members on only the 2 bars of the rearward facing chevron. In a car park that is secure-access only underneath the government buildings of New Zealand’s capital city. This was actually the first time Jerry had used this mechanism, and the PM himself had only had one previous occasion with the previous GCSB Director in his two and a half years in office, and they both knew that it was only resorted to for serious matters that were not for public consumption until some careful deliberation had taken place. John obviously respected the technical and political skills his GCSB boss demonstrated, and knew he would not have called the meeting lightly. Jerry drew a deep breath and started. “Well Sir, you will recall the intel our office has provided you in regards to the various 2012 Doomsday Cults? Despite the death of Osama the other day, we now have very solid leads on a number of these that confirm our earlier belief that several of the more serious cults are organising themselves together, and aligning themselves with certain terrorist organisations to deliver a global Doomsday campaign. And if that isn't enough, I have to report that now we are certain there is a NZ-based group of individuals who are also making a global extermination plot.” “What!” Mr Key exploded incredulously “New Zealand terrorists?!” “Well Sir,” Jerry responded carefully, “I wouldn't go so far as to label them 'terrorists', as their goal is not terror. Their goal is simply the extermination of everyone on the planet outside of New Zealand.” “And how is that not terrorism?” Key asked tapping the table with his thumb, an aggrieved look on his face. “Of course, technically it is terrorism, but these people are rank amateurs and they don't have the same kind of 'cause' that terrorists usually have.” “So if they're amateurs, we don't have to worry about them. Pick them up, lock them up quietly, problem solved?” John retorted. “Actually Sir,” Jerry almost squirmed in his seat, “We could do that, but we think that this could be our solution to the bigger problem of the real terrorists. Fin, why don't you tell the Prime Minister your plan.” Fin noticed the “your plan” emphasis momentarily analysing that this was both an out for his boss if it went wrong or wasn't liked, and praise if it was good. However, in their line of work, he was used to such double-edged swords of words almost as much as he was used to more substantive, sharp, shiny and less metaphysical swords and was happy to let it pass uncommented. “Sir, actually these un-terrorists are old school friends of mine. It seems they are putting in place a plan to develop stocks of a virulently lethal biological agent, and deploy this agent globally in a manner that is likely to kill all humans across the world, leaving only our country unaffected. They are doing this because they have come to believe the same information that we now know to be true – that there are cults and terrorists intent on destroying the world, and they plan on launching a pre-emptive strike to beat them at their own game and be the last ones standing.” The PM, for a complete change, was lost for words. It was a tall order to believe that some ordinary Kiwi citizens were planning such an audacious event. Finally, he got himself back under control. “How on earth do they expect to pull that off by themselves?” he demanded “Is that even possible?” “Unfortunately it is.” Fin confirmed. He reached over and opened the manila folder spreading out the papers inside for the PM's attention. On one was a fact sheet with a Bio-Haz warning logo on the top right hand corner. It was headed up “The Anthrola Virus” and featured an 'Executive Summary' style description of the lethal effects of the virus before going on to more detail describing the origins, the mechanism by which it worked, the symptoms and a list of the facilities that were known to have samples of the virus. A second sheet featured a report detailing what they knew about the plot – called Operation Scythe, and a third sheet with photo's and descriptions of the plotters – Josh, Tom, Liz and Linda. It was an extremely condensed version of the information they had back at GCSB HQ, but it contained all that the PM needed to know. John had already read the executive summary of the Anthrola virus and picked up and started to read the report on Scythe. Fin and Douglas let him read, waiting patiently in silence. The report was thorough and concise, carefully crafted to be the best way to deliver the news. It detailed how the group was sourcing funding, the activities of Josh in his Bio-Haz Services business, and the fact that Tom and Linda had recently made an order for two million air-freshener cans and spray units broken into smaller, staged, delivery lots. This last recent item cemented the belief that they were committing to taking the project off the drawing board and into reality and was the reason Fin had now stopped delaying in bringing their activities to his superiors attention. The PM put down the report, his mind reeling. He picked it up again, but he looked at it with eyes that weren't receiving. “Two million cans!!” he was thinking. “My god!” he finally breathed into the silence. “Yes Sir.” replied Fin quietly and tastefully. “Perhaps you can see why we think they might be able to succeed?” John quietly nodded. His mind still struggling with the enormity and sheer audaciousness of the plan. Fin continued, “and therefore, if they can succeed, then they neutralise the threat from the real terrorists for us.” John suddenly focused his eyes on Fin, slamming his palm down on the table to emphasise his point “By wiping out the entire world’s population!” he reminded them. “Yes Sir.” agreed Jerry taking over from Fin. “But Sir, consider this … ” he started ticking off the points with his fingers “One) the threat from the cults linking with the terrorists is very real. Two) stopping them any conventional way is beyond our capability. Three) enlisting other countries agencies is also not going to get them all without violating every law there ever was, and Four) if we go after one group, it is likely to cause the others to trigger their plans early with catastrophic results. As unpalatable a thought as it might be, the tactical solution that this Project Scythe provides is one of the best options.” “At the expense of billions of innocent lives.” Key repeated. “Yes Sir.” repeated Jerry. “However thousands of innocent lives are lost every day, and if you take a long hard look at the world at the moment, what have you got – you've got a mess really. You've got religious wars where brother is fighting brother, you've got turf wars where the people fighting now have really no idea of the original reason – it's just entrenched in their upbringing from thousands of years ago, and you've got global warming and one man-made disaster after another. Almost everywhere outside of New Zealand you have an unsustainable ecological pressure of a multitude of people on limited resources which are fast being ripped out of the ground and largely squandered. The world is currently fighting over land and oil. Pretty soon they will be fighting over fresh water, and soon after that they'll be fighting over clean air. We've always said how lucky we are to live here in our own little un-spoilt paradise – don't you think it's time we made the hard decision to secure paradise before we get dragged into the mire the rest of the world is getting itself into now?” John Key was a good honest Kiwi bloke at heart. But he was also a pragmatist and a good leader. He could make hard decisions, and he recognised the logic in what they were suggesting - but the humanist in him was not going to give up without a fight. And even if this was the most clear cut logic in the world, there was a whole lot more to consider than what had been spoken so far. “This needs more thought.” he finally pronounced. “I hear what you're saying Jerry, but I need a team set up to debate this. Naturally it needs to be a very tiny team of select individuals with security clearances that are off the chart. This stays with us until then. Clearance will be name only.” They nodded agreement. “In the meantime we let Scythe run free Sir?” Jerry asked for official confirmation. “Yes” answered Key. “But you better make sure you know exactly what they're doing at all times, without showing your hand.” “Of course Sir.” they both answered together. “My God!” he muttered again half to himself as picked up the folder and walked out of the SCIF room. Fin and Jerry sat for a few seconds and then Fin looked at his boss “Well,” he said “he bought it.” Jerry nodded “So far.” he said wryly “You'd better be damn sure about them though Fin. The words 'there's a lot riding on this one' do not even come close to describing this mess.” He stood up to leave. “I know my friends” Fin replied steadfast in his belief as he too rose from his chair. “They won't let us down. Especially if we give them a wee quiet nudge from the shadows along the way as and if required.” And with nothing more to say, they left the SCIF shutting the door behind them and sliding the plaque on the front from “Busy” to “Free”. Environs of Maiko National Park, DR Congo, 04 May 2011 (Wednesday) 1500 Zulu Deep in the heart of the African continent, above the steamy rainforest that swarmed in the vicinity of the waters that fed the second largest river on Earth, a green/grey gnat-machine batted through the turgid air as it headed towards home base. A solid, barrel-chested man sat clipped in to the canvas seat looking pensively out the pinned-back door of the Huey as it's twin blades smacked their endlessly rotating path through the heat of the African afternoon. He never tired of the view from the chopper and even though others would see a boring endless canopy of green, he read the lay of the land, the loops and rapids of the river systems, saw the interplay between land & water, tree and sky and constantly probed for and analysed the human presences and potential targets for human presence. He especially looked for signs of hidden humans and for potential places where he could have hiding places. LeBlanc was a man in need of plenty of hiding places. His business was not of the sort that endeared itself to law enforcement. He was, in fact, a terrorist. Or more correctly, he was “a fixer”, or an enabler of terrorists. He recruited where necessary, but usually it was a case of linking one group with another for a common purpose and finding them equipment, funding and training. Usually the cause showed itself to them, sometimes he would 'nudge' them in a direction that suited his purposes – mostly other customers purposes. A modern business person would probably describe him as a freelance consultant or business mentor while other, more simple persons might call him a gun-runner. Right at the moment he was coming back from a visit to Somalia where he had been assessing and assisting another batch of Somali pirates as potential 'grist for the mill' of one of his customers' cause. The pirates had recently completed a successful oil tanker hijack and had money to burn on new equipment. LeBlanc was quietly grooming them to step away from the pirate cause and up into the more elite circles of the militia and terrorism. There were several groups he worked with who would pay a worthwhile 'recruiting fee' for his trouble. It might seem odd for a terrorist enabler to have such a mighty machine as the indomitable Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter at his disposal, but this was a serious business, and he was well funded. He even had a Bell AH-1 Cobra attack gunship helicopter, but that was a bit more conspicuous! The Iroquois was also more useful for cargo carrying and troop deployment as well, hence it's more frequent use. The home base he was headed for was more of a training camp than a home. Hidden deep in the jungle that surrounded the headwater tributaries of the mighty Congo river, it was remote, and he hoped, impossible to find unassisted. From the town of Waine-Rukula, if you followed the twists and turns of the Maiko River deep into the Parc National de la Maiko closer to the Uganda and Rwanda borders, and then if you picked the correct un-named side river that fed into the Maiko and followed that upstream, you might find a place where for a section of about 100 metres, the tree canopies reached together from either bank hiding the river from any aerial observation, but leaving enough room for a carefully controlled helicopter to fly underneath and hover at the edge of a short jetty that sprouted suddenly, as if from nowhere, out of the left-hand bank. The jetty came out just far enough to keep the Huey rotor blades safely clear of the tree branches, but it took an accomplished pilot to perform the feat. If you did find this spot however, and you were an unscheduled visitor, you would not live to tell anyone of the jetty in the middle of nowhere, for the trees on the bank featured several carefully concealed observation hides that were always manned with tough individuals who were competent with the long barreled rifles they carried. When it came to weaponry in Africa, most people used the ubiquitous AK-47. Its simple design and ruggedness, coupled with its commonness, made it the perfect weapon for the large continent. However, the AK-47 was limited in longer range accurate shooting stakes so these guards had the equally rugged L1A1 SLR with its longer barrel and 11mm longer cartridge than the AK's, contributing to a superior range and stopping power. With their wooden 'furniture', and solid metal construction, they were big, heavy and ugly in a functional way that only a soldier could love. These men had depended on them for their lives. As LeBlanc's chopper approached the spot, the guards heard it before they could see it. There was no need for the radio identification that was available since the chopper was distinctive and expected. They tried to limit radio use just in case there were any eavesdroppers out there trying to find them – LeBlanc hadn't survived as long as he had in this business without being careful, and radio silence was a standard, common-sense precaution. It didn't mean they couldn't use the much shorter range personal communication radios that the guards used to ensure the security of the camp. They had a common frequency radio network which all the guards were plugged into at all times via earplug and voice activated throat mike. However any 'RF snooper' would have to be right in the immediate vicinity of the camp to detect the signal. Careful choice of frequency and power, and achieving the required coverage by a network of carefully sited repeaters, meant they broadcast all they liked and the foliage would block the signals from being intercepted above, while still keeping them all in touch within the different parts of the camp. As the chopper carefully beat its way up the side river, low over the water, the designated 'downstream' guard radioed in its arrival. It hardly hovered for more than a couple of seconds over the jetty edge before LeBlanc had hopped down onto its decking. He strode away without looking back as it ponderously continued its course upstream, around the bend and continued for a few more bends before breaking out of the river bed and making a beeline for its home. The helicopters 'lived' in a different place to the rest of the camp. A small natural clearing about two kilometres away featured a carefully camouflaged hangar for the two birds well back under the trees. When the choppers were coming and going, a movable screen of artificial shrubs was used to shield the under-tree entrance from any prying eyes as the choppers were pushed, on their clip-on wheel units, into concealment as soon as they had landed. The hangar was connected to the base by a path that wound under the densest parts of the jungle cover, wide enough for a small truck, but seldom used by any vehicle to further minimise the chances of detection. The comm-link network extended out here too, with directional repeaters (rather than omni-directional repeaters) spaced strategically along the path. LeBlanc did not consider himself paranoid about security - just highly conscious and not given to taking unnecessary risks. While he had worked very hard to remain anonymous and on the sidelines of the terrorist world stage, he knew his little enterprise would be high on the 'wanted' list for any law enforcement or military operations, for without their sponsor or source of military supplies, the terror elements would not exist for long. Also, he knew it was just as likely that he might be found 'accidentally' while such an organisation was searching for some other party. As LeBlanc strode along the jetty he glanced up into the trees to check the guards were doing their jobs. Despite the fact that he was a distinctive man and their boss, he was satisfied to see that the designated 'jetty' guard had his rifle trained on him all the way from when he was in the chopper, and that the 'downstream' and 'upstream' guards paid him only scant attention at the edge of their interlocking visual sweeps through their patrol areas. It had only been necessary to make an example of one guard soon after they had set up here, to teach them all how seriously he took security. Ever since that careless, lax, man had been steadily skinned alive over the span of several days, the other guards had learnt the lesson very well. His marked, but un-named grave was the first thing you saw when you exited the compound main gate as a constant reminder of the unflagging rules. At the edge of the jetty he approached the camouflaged 'bank' guard post and gave the codeword. The guard nodded and handed him one of the comm-link units. Only when LeBlanc started putting on the comm-link did the 'jetty' guard relax his cover and return to his scan of the jetty and far river bank. LeBlanc strode purposely along the path to the main compound. He was pleased with the set-up and the discipline the men were showing. It had only been possible for him to see them because he knew where to look, otherwise, the river bank had seemed deserted and the jetty totally out of place. As he completed his short walk towards the compound, he radioed in as he reached the checkpoint that faced the gate “Alpha One at Skin Point”. Again, he was satisfied to see the inner perimeter guards had their rifles on him up until he made the call. Making the grave marker the checkpoint was he thought a decidedly constant reminder! He waited a few seconds until he heard “Doormat clear” in his earpiece, and then he strode forward the last 5 metres to the door in the compound wall, stepping through as it opened for him. He watched the process as one of the inner guards was covering him with his SLR while the door opener secured the door, reactivated the mines outside and made the call over his radio “Doormat live”. Once the door was shut and the mines reactivated, the inner guard relaxed his weapon and gave a nod of recognition to LeBlanc. Continuous repetition of the security process had been drummed into them all. Trust no-one until you know for sure who they are and that the area is secure. The marked grave regularly taunted them to this need. Once inside, LeBlanc could see more easily the nature of the compound he had designed and built himself. As he always did when returning from anything more than a same-day trip, he scrutenised and surveyed it as if for the first time, probing the features and looking for weaknesses that he might have missed. Starting at the perimeter, the outer fence was a circle, unbroken except at the three entrance/exits which were positioned in the nature of a “Y” so that there two other exits if one was targetted, and there wasn't a straight line of sight from either of the entrances to any of the others. He'd chosen the circle shape rather than a square, rectangle or other shape since it offered no edges or side-by-side bulges by which someone could gain leverage against to climb up the wall. To further prevent climbing, the perimeter fence itself was made from vertical strips of stainless steel mounted with their thin edges facing in/out to maximise the visibility through the structure so they could see and fire through it much more readily. The upright strips were set at their base into concrete that was buried under half a metre of earth, and held together near the top by welding to another strip of steel. There were no bolts or rough surfaces to gain a climbing purchase on. To prevent anyone trying to grapple hook this horizontal joiner, the uprights continued for about another foot above this, and then featured a 'crown' of sturdy but thin and razor sharp metal that would cut through any rope passed over it, plus the electrical signal passing through it, would be distorted signaling a disturbance to the control room. Outside the fence for a distance of 5 metres, a densely populated mine field of “Bouncing Betty” S-mines ran all around the fence. At the 3 entrances, the S-mines were replaced with Claymores angled on each side of the clear path. The Claymores were triggered by an infrared virtual tripwire which was armed and disarmed from the controls at each gate. 5 metres inside the fence, a replica steel upright fence was positioned, and again, the space in between was filled with mines. At the gates, the guard post was an air-lock style box which extended 4 metres each side of the path and was delineated by thick bullet-proof Lexan panels – including the roof to shield from rain and grenades or other projectiles alike. The side panels featured thin horizontal slots for the rifle barrels but otherwise provided a safe, dry haven for the guards with unlimited visibility. The outer door was a replica of the vertical bars fence, while the inner door was bullet-proof Lexan in a solid metal frame. Inside the inner fence, the jungle was totally cleared out except for some of the larger trees that towered up high above the compound. These trees provided a natural, spreading canopy to hide the base from the air. By careful selection using the helicopter as a spotter, LeBlanc had achieved almost a complete canopy cover up top, while having an almost totally clear circular space below. There were a couple of small natural openings in the foliage but the spots were known and nothing incriminating took place in those spots other than the occasional person walking through it. Closer in towards the centre of the circle were the bases buildings. The majority of them were underground with the entranceway built up against the tree that provided its camouflage. There were a handful of small buildings however, built around a tree with the roof of each carefully constructed to present an irregular shape from above and careful tree-like camouflage was employed as well to hide each structure. The insides of the walls and roof were also well insulated to minimise the chances of heat signatures being detected. The underground entranceways were like concrete outhouses, festooned with shrub-like appendages to make them blend in with the tree's surrounds. They were open-fronted since they led steeply down-stairs immediately, and dealing with a door from the downstairs side was too difficult. Instead, as the steps reached the bottom, a pair of airlock style doors were encountered, before opening into the underground chamber. The underground chambers were down quite deep – so as not to disturb unduly the roots of the trees, and also to provide a shield for bunker-style safety. The underground building had been dug as one huge area but had been finished as three separated spaces over two levels. One space was the Base HQ and staff quarters, the second was the mess hall, recreational area and guest quarters, and the third area one level down featured the training rooms, over-flow accommodation, and a 25 yard rifle & handgun range. The three sections were sealed off completely from each other with thick reinforced concrete walls. There were separate entrances to each area, and the only interconnect between them was one case where the overflow accommodation near the training rooms could be accessed from the guest quarters, however each entranceway featured a heavy security door that was opened via a programmable electronic prox (proximity) device and LeBlanc could control who had access and who didn't. The electronic locks were linked to the Control Room computers and each activation was logged with the user code recorded. Each permanent staff member had a small personal issue prox device (usually on a strap around their neck), while guests would be issued a larger, more fragile, card style device – either personally or via the squad or troop leader depending on status and trustworthiness. Each underground area featured one main entranceway with the electronic air-lock doors, and two emergency egress points. The latter consisted of a solid concrete tube with a vertical ladder bolted to the inside with a hatch at the bottom and another at the top that opened only from within – again the electronic swipe card would unlock the hatch. These hatches were disguised from above as large shrubs or tree stumps. Clustered around the perimeter not too far away from the entranceway to the underground rifle range, were the few above-ground buildings. While in reasonable proximity to each other, they were all separated by a distance of at least ten metres, and in addition to the camouflage elements, they featured thick blast-proof Lexan wall paneling’s. These were storage rooms for the explosives and ammunition. Predominantly on the opposite side of the compound from the collection of ammo huts, but scattered around the compound in aerially concealed locations, an obstacle course could be seen, featuring a climbing platform with a skinny wall up the side of one of the trees, a scramble net, a barbwire covered mud crawl, a low obstacle wall (solid), a high obstacle wall with spaced slats, and a section of tire-run leading to a choice of rope or tree climb and high rope. The various training elements could be incorporated into the morning or afternoon PT runs with or without kit in endless combinations. After a few days of in-compound training of this sort, they would normally head them outside the compound and tackle the natural jungle environment on extended forced marches or jungle runs. LeBlanc's practiced eye swept the area mentally checking off each item correctly in its place with no change to the tree canopy cover. Satisfied, he headed to the main HQ entranceway. Just before he ducked in and down the stairs, he checked in on his comm-link. “Alpha One at HQ” he said, then flicked the switch that deactivated the throat mic, pulled out his prox pendant from under his shirt, swiped and opened the first door. As he made his way through the empty 'air-lock' to the second door, he noticed that one of the control room staff was watching him through the Lexan panels, with one hand on a pistol on the desktop beside him. LeBlanc nodded to him as he proxed the door open and stepped inside the building proper. As the guard verified his identity matched the prox card details and photo that came up on his screen, he took his hand off the pistol and returned to scanning his instruments. The control room did not open directly to the interior space accessed through the 'airlock' entrance, however the side wall observed this area through several layers of the clear blast-proof Lexan The compound had not been cheap to build, but the security it offered him was second to none and the cost had already been repaid from the training business he brought into it. When they brought trainees in, they were more often than not brought a long way up the river well past the side stream. The boat would then ground on one end of a random 'island' and transfer them to the chopper which would land on the other end. Once in the chopper they would be blindfolded before taking off in an unrelated direction, then going through a series of random and bewildering turns and motions to confuse their sense of direction, before carrying on in the proper direction to intercept the side stream and the jetty. Once hovering over the jetty, their blindfolds would be removed and they would be escorted through the guards (who made themselves very visible on these occasions), to the guest quarters mess hall where they would be processed for identification and advised in no uncertain terms of the rules. Unless they were favoured guests (which they almost never were), their weapons would be taken from them before getting on the chopper and stored in the out-buildings until needed for training. The guests were very conscious that they had no weapons while the compound staff had plenty. Each staff member usually wore at least one knife and a pistol strapped to their waist or body webbing. Additionally when they exited the underground buildings, they would usually also collect either an AK-47 or an SLR depending on their task. LeBlanc went past the control room and briefly ducked into the kitchenette to grab a beer from the fridge. While the main mess hall was in the next-door guest quarters section, they had a separate means of having drinks and snacks in this area so they could be self sufficient if necessary and not have to go the long way round to grab a coffee. They were just coming out of the dry season and the heat was oppressively muggy. He pressed the cold bottle against his forehead and rolled it all over as he headed further along the corridor to his private office adjacent to the map room. Proxing the lock, he opened the door, stepped in and settled in to his chair, then he took a refreshing swig of the cool liquid, savouring it in his mouth for a few seconds before swallowing and poking his computer into life. He was expecting an e-mail. Berbera, Somalia, 21 June 2011 (Tuesday) 1500 Zulu Hunkered down on the flat roof, Fin was feeling the heat. Even though he was both hiding from his quarry and sheltering from the sun, he was exposed to the reflections off the roof of the afternoon sun. He slowly and carefully lifted the floppy-brimmed hat and wiped the sweat from his brow while still keeping his eyes on the building across the road and the approach to it. Placing his eye back to the high power, stubby, telescope on its tripod, he again scanned the buildings inner courtyard, focusing once more on the group lounging around inside in the shade of a patched and faded, stripy awning. Fin was pirate watching. Not, the 'shivver-me-timbers-parrot-on-the-shoulder' type of pirate, but perhaps an even deadlier type – the modern Somali oil tanker hi-jacking type. Armed with AK-47's, RPG's, sat-phones and jet-ski's, these guys had no compunction in killing and blowing up an oil tanker causing a massive ecological disaster if they didn't get their way – which was to receive large sums of millions of dollars. While these guys were a security concern in their own right, from Fin's intelligence intercepts, they had reason to believe this particular batch of pirates was trying to step up into the big league and work with some of the really nasty players – even the AQIM if they could build up the “cred” to be worthy. They had not been able to pinpoint the real big 'bad-boys' so far and were hoping to access them through these 'little fish'. AQIM (al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) is a North Africa region-wide jihadist alliance. It is primarily made up of Algeria's jihadist groups but the intelligence Fin's team had been gathering over the last year, and which had been accelerating over the last few months, indicated that AQIM was extending their co-ordination further afield and linking up with other Al-Qaeda-linked terrorist cells elsewhere in the region - including many Somali groups. Some of these groups had received training in terrorist hideouts in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Somalia was a perfect spot for this, as it was strategically located along one side and at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden through which a lot of the worlds key cargo ships flowed. Directly across the Gulf, was Yemen at the bottom of the Middle East, and specifically across from Berbera, where Fin was today, was the port of Aden, where a terrorist bomb killed 17 aboard the USS Cole a decade earlier. From their base across the road, the pirates could zoom out in their jet-ski's right into the busy sea-lanes for their pick of the ships, or sneak across into Yemen, (itself a hot-bed of unrest), then either over-land through Saudi Arabia to Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan & Pakistan, or along the coast to access these Al-Qaeda “home bases”. Fin's current role in Special Projects for the GCSB didn't normally involve field work of this sort, but due to the extreme sensitivity of this project, they couldn't use a lot of their normal resources and had to do a lot of it themselves. On this mission, even though they had intercepted reasonably specific intel about the group being about to receive Al-Qaeda sponsored training, it was still only a slim lead among many options, and so Fin had only himself, and one local 'affiliated agent' to call on for assistance. The French DGSE trained local was acting the part of a fisherman working on the hull of his friends upturned boat in the place next to the pirates'. Ade (pronounced Ah-deh), was a deep cover local and lived in the parts so he was able to be so open and close without raising any suspicion, however Fin had to be much more circumspect and had to avoid any overt contact with him lest he blow his cover. Fin was able to relay progress reports and meeting details via text messages to his cell phone which would vibrate rather than ring at his call. Thus at a little after 3 o'clock, when Fin saw a battered land rover approaching, he was pre-warned and hard at work with his sander – but ready with the magnetic tracker button for any opportunity to slip it in or onto the vehicle should it prove to be the awaited contact. As the land rover approached down the street, it started slowing as if the driver was searching for something, and then stopped outside the building. A young African man in his mid to late 20's got out from the driver’s seat and knocked on the door to the courtyard gate of the pirates building. As he did so, Ade hoisted a crate of nets up on his shoulder, and started walking down the road on a course that would take him alongside the land rover. As the driver was ushered in through the door of the pirate compound, Ade seemed to accidentally drop a float out of the crate beside the outside rear wheel of the jeep, and as he bent and put down his crate to pick it up, he deftly attached the magnetic tracker up underneath the side of the land rover before scooping up the float, and continuing on his way. Meanwhile up on the roof, Fin was busy with the long lens digital SLR camera. He'd already taken some shots of the land rover as it parked outside the pirate lair, and of the young man getting out and meeting the pirates who'd opened the door and led him inside. He'd made sure to zoom in close on the number plate, and for chain-of-evidence reasons, had also several shots of Ade placing the GPS tracking device. Now he waited for the young man to come back out to get some front-on shots while watching, and photographing, the activity in the compound. Ade meanwhile had gone on and disappeared – back to pick up his own 4WD and drive it around to the back of the building to pick up Fin if needed. In the “olden days”, with only the two of them, he would have had to hang around to try and follow the land rover which would have an increased risk of being spotted. Even the older tracking devices had an element of risk as they relied on sending a radio signal which meant you still had to follow with a radio receiver to track where they went. The new tracker technology, however, made things a lot easier and safer, by recording the precise GPS co-ordinates at time-stamped intervals and squirted the info up to a satellite network for downloading anywhere in the world. The device was 'smart' though and adjusted the frequency of the updates depending on the rate of motion – if it detected rapid motion it would update more frequently, if stationary, less frequently. Fin's team back in NZ would be accessing the info at the same time as Fin himself in Somalia. By overlaying the tracker positions on an accurate map, they could follow the vehicle and see where it stopped and check them out later without appearing to be connected to following the vehicle. It seemed as if this was indeed the contact they'd been expecting. The young man had been ushered over to the group of pirates under the awning. He'd handed over a slightly grubby A4-sized envelope and then had been led back to the door. As he and the land rover was leaving, the pirates started breaking up into ones and twos, heading off to different parts of the building and courtyard. The ones around the courtyard started getting boxes of gear out of storage sheds and loading them on the tray of a beat-up looking utility vehicle. They were obviously preparing to go somewhere. Fin briefly considered his options. He needed to know where they were going that was for sure. If it was to the training camp, it would no doubt lead to being able to track other groups that also came through the camp in the future, and with a lot of luck they could lead directly to the Al Qaeda network. Tracking the messenger might not lead anywhere, especially if he was just a simple messenger. He couldn't risk trailing them when they were either collected or went to their meet point, as the chance of being spotted and blowing their cover was too high. He sent a text to Ade “Not moving. Need tracker on cargo - wood crate - green rpg.” Ade knew it would be difficult. He would need to prepare the device and then wait for an opportunity to place it without arousing suspicions. This would be next to impossible inside the compound so they'd have to wait until they came out. He returned to his boat repairs and in between his various comings and goings between boat and house, prepped his bug. The particular bug had the same functionality as the magnetic one he'd popped on the land rover, but was in the form of something between a nail and a drawing pin. The sharpened shaft was both housing for the electronics, antenna, and secure mounting aid. He had fitted it into a pen-sized pneumatic nail-gun-like launching device that would mean he could drive it into the wooden box by simply touching it to the side and clicking the button. The compressed air would be released propelling the 'nail' biting into the wood. In this manner it was similar to a nail-gun but a lot quieter than those cartridge powered construction tools. Now, with the loaded launcher in his pocket, he just had to wait for his opportunity to access the cargo. Meanwhile, Fin was alternating his watch between the compound, the road, and the laptop with the tracker overlaid on the grid-map of the area he had loaded up. Everything looked normal and the land rover appeared to be heading out the other side of town without making any other stops. In the pirates compound, they appeared to be finished with their preparations. There was a small stack of wooden crates on the Ute as well as a collection of kitbags and backpacks. Fin thought that the crates looked like they could hold weapons – two of them were the RPG crates he'd advised Ade about, three seemed to be holding long rifles and assault rifles, and he'd seen the larger box filled as a catch-all container with a selection of military paraphernalia such as radios, maps, compass', GPS devices and the like. One of the crates would be a good location for the bug, and Fin had already indicated to Ade that the RPG box might be the best. He knew that Ade, with plenty of warning, could paint the tracker heads green as camouflage to hide it from view on the chosen crate, all he needed was a couple of seconds of access to the back of the Ute they were loaded in. Checking the laptop again, he noticed the land rover had finally come to a stop. It was out at the airport but parked away from the main terminal area in an area of no obvious function. Curious, Fin flicked up a file, entering his password to de-crypt it as he did so, and checked the satellite staging times listed inside. It would be another three quarters of an hour before the nearest satellite would swing past in it's never-ending arc. He checked the compound again - the pirates seemed to have finished their burst of activity and were back to the waiting game that all military men get so well used to. The Ute was loaded and abandoned, and the men were starting to bring out the makings of a meal. It looked like he had time. Securing the file and closing the laptop, he sent another text to Ade - “meet FOX in 5”, then he carefully reversed himself back from the edge of the roof and packed up his laptop, camera, tripod and scope into his back-pack, before checking and erasing any signs of his presence on the roof. He then moved towards the back of the building and down into the street on the far side. The back of the OP (Observation Post) was their designated point “Foxtrot” and only a minute after he was down, Ade came around the corner, carrying a small stack of planks on his shoulder – still continuing the boat fixing pretense. Quickly Fin brought him up to speed with what he had seen, the position of the messenger at the airport, and then handed him the camera to page through the shots he'd taken. Ade nodded and grunted as he saw the photos of the crates on the open decked Ute, satisfied that the tracker he'd selected would be suitable for the boxes. After studying the photo's carefully he agreed with Fin's assessment that bugging the vehicle would not be as effective as bugging the people or their cargo, as they would be likely to switch vehicles at some point, but their gear they would need to take with them. Bugging the pirates themselves was too risky and the crates offered the best opportunity. They decided the device would best be placed into the edge of the lid of one of the crates near one of the hinges as the least likely place to be spotted. They sketched out a plan whereby Fin, driving the land rover, would momentarily block the path of the pirates giving Ade the couple of seconds he needed to plant the tracker. It was a simple plan, but in their world, the simpler the plan, the more likely it was to work – complex plans had too many opportunities for things to go wrong. With the plan decided, Ade went back to his boat repairs and Fin went back up to the roof of their OP. Taking a small tube out of a pocket of the backpack, he carefully edged forward and secured the device into the structure of the air-conditioning unit such that it pointed down towards the pirate courtyard but was hidden from anything other than a serious search. Scooting back to his bag, he pulled out the laptop and plugged in a USB stick device which connected him to the camera he'd just placed checking the camera was sending, and the field of view was workable. He took another few minutes to edge forward again to make a small adjustment, then satisfied, returned the laptop to his bag and descended to the ground again. Time to prepare for his first direct contact with the enemy. ",candidate00003
5,00002,candidate00003,"The empty void of space … Majestic swirl of a spiral arm galaxy … [Zoom in… and in … and in … ] Near the outer arm the object moves. It's rate seems languid against the backdrop of stellar vastness, but it's long, kazoo-like shape, gobbled up the parsecs at an astronomical rate. [Zoom] The object was clearly artificial, however its surface, which resembled liquid mercury, showed no external protrusions of any kind including engine exhausts, panels, fasteners or openings. [Zoom] Slowly, with the speed of molasses dripping off a spoon, a section of the wall disolved into it's translucent state. She gazed out, seeing with her own eyes, that which her instruments had already shown her. Her ship had probed the spectrum, analysing the visual, phonics, sonic, sub-sonic, ELF, RF, SHF, and way past even the microwave range. It had “sniffed” for gasses, charted, probed and measured each bit of matter encountered as it thundered silently through space, gobbling up the parsecs on it's tireless journey, and now, still far ahead, it showed with the laser highlighted symbology of the viewing port heads-up display (HUD) the spot of light that piqued it's artificial curiosity. It had woken her towards the end of her normal sleep period with a report on an item that fitted the progammed parameters for special attention. Before it interrupted her peaceful slumber, the ship had run a battery of specific sensor sweeps and collected several Exabytes worth of data which it consolodated into the report. It was still just the beginning, but already the report exceeded several encyclopedia's worth of data covering geology, geography, biology, entmology, and sociology, on the target that had set off the alarm. She had woken to the muted alarm and knew instantly that they had discovered that which they searched for. With growing excitement therefore, she reached for the crystal-like object that materialised beside her sleep platform and thumbed the projection node. Instantly a holographic-like projection of a blue-white ball appeared above the crystal-like reader. As the sphere rotated, the data of the report began reciting directly into her brain. Simultaneously, the white disappeared revealing the geography of the planet hiding beneath the clouds. The atmospheric and planetary makeup played through her mind as she saw the land masses with their plains, mountains, rivers and lakes exposed to her view. It was not unfamiliar to her as she had seen many worlds in her journey, but this one she knew already due to the alarm, was different, and now as the initial basic planetary brief wound up she was going to see what the alarm meant. The briefing moved on from the planetary geology into the biological/entmological phase of the report and she leaned forward as if this would bring her closer to see all the better. The planet teemed with life. Large, small, winged, bipedal, quadrapedal, finned, and tailed. On the land, in the air and in the shallows and depths of the oceans, lifeforms of all stages of evolution crept, crawled and glided. And there, predominant over all, was the bidepal form of intelligent life that had set off the alarm and initiated the barrage of tests, for before the ship had even gotten close enough to see the tiny globe, it had felt it's far reaching presence. RF communications to and from a small object listlissly tracing it's arcing path outwards on it's own voyage of discovery. The signals had triggered the ships automated sensors, setting in motion the pre-programmed sequence. It had triangulated the signal, identified the craft, swept it with an array of sensors and rapidly determined it's nature. This discovery then triggered a second tier of tests – the ship computed the object's trajectory, and searched backwards along it's path to see what it could find. The unrelenting physics of the universe rapidly pinpointed the most likely stellar system and zoomed in to find the planetary origin. While still more than a full lightyear away, the ship identified the tiny jewel it sought. Changing course slightly, the ship had sped towards the star system while probing the depths ahead for every possible clue. Thus, while she slept on, the ship closed inexorably on it's target while sifting the data to prepare the report for her. Recorders locked in on the plethora of faint RF spectrum signals emanating from the distant dot, while the computer dissected the signals for the intelligence that was obviously contained inside. Measuring, interpreting, the ship was building up knowledge – painting a picture of the world ahead and the nature of the intelligence it was built to seek out. As the ship had closed on the star system it's powerful sensors probed and prodded far, far ahead of it, sifting and weighing. While still well outside the orbit of the farthest object of the star's planetary system, it determined it had enough data for the preliminary report. It further decided she had slept a suitable period and set about lighting and warming the ship for her awakening and then sounded the gentle alarm to raise her from her slumbers and alert her to the find. Now she gazed from the holo-globe spinning in front of her, out the viewport to the HUD-defined dot, noting the other HUD-annotated pinpoints of light which were this planet's sisters, and the rapidly largening yellow main sequence star / sun which they all orbited. Looking back to the report projector, she again flicked her long digit over the control node, triggering the report to move onto the data it had accumulated thus far on the intelligent life-form. As the data played through her head she grew increasingly excited as the data showed the technological achievements the species had attained. Obviously they had space flight – the object initially discovered so far away from the planets origin was evidence of that, but the ships analysis of the communication signals intercepted showed much more than that. As the analysis played on her excitement, slowly gave way to alarm and worry … “Mok-saaaannnnngggggggggggggg … “ As the last notes of the call echoed around the rafters of the dojo, he breathed in – slowly, through his nose, pushing the air up to the top and back of his head, then smoothly exhaling out through his mouth as he pushed the air down his spine to his toes and then all the way back up to the top of his head as he inhaled again. Jim had been training Kendo now for about 4 years, and he always looked forward to the circular breathing session at the close of training. After a fast and furious hour and a bit of smacking the living shit out of everyone else, that first deep breath in & out was kind of delicious! He'd taken a wee while and a bit of research to cotton on to the idea of circular breathing – how could any sensible person think that you pushed air up into your skull etc?, but once he twigged, the practice really did become very peaceful & soothing, and he could see how with a bit more application, there was the possibility of achieving that “no-mind” state where the next level of learning might be achieved. “Good training” he said, bowing to the others in the dojo. And then, he tapped one of the mid-level members on the shoulder and said “I was watching your attacks tonight – I think you are holding back too much. You can do it, I know you can, I've seen you do it, - you just need to be confident in yourself and always attack, attack, attack.” Jim always tried to offer constructive advice to the members that were obviously trying hard. As one of the club seniors it was expected of him, and he knew that not only did it help the learners, but it helped push him too, as he had to observe the others and analyse their stengths and weaknesses while working on his own weaknesses – and all in the heat of “battle”. As he wiped and stowed his armour in his bogu bag, Jim's mind started returning to “the real world”. He checked his cellphone for any missed calls or messages and saw one text message had arrived - unheard during the confusion of loud kiai's and the stamps and thwacks of bamboo sword on battle armour. It was from Tim. “Mail frm Chris. U r on for jpn & me 2 mmbai. C u 2moro, fly on w/e.” “Great”, he half groaned to himself. Approaching his teacher, Jim bowed and said “Sabumnim, I won't be at Kendo next week – I have to go to Japan.” “No problem James, maybe you can train Kendo while you're there?” his teacher replied. “Hmmm, I'm not sure, but I'll try!” Only his Kendo teacher called him by his real name, everyone else called him “Jim”. At 44, Jim was starting to suffer the effects of age. He supposed he wasn't doing too badly compared to others his age, but part from the Kendo, the only other exercise he did was biking to and from work, and so the morning tea hot chocolates and other sweet things he craved from time to time were starting to be noticeable in the tummy area. He had always been pretty active but recently the demands of his higher position at work meant there weren't enough hours left in the day for the long distance running he quite enjoyed. Well, that's what he always said – truth be known, it was much easier to give in to the laziness! Of course he knew there was only one person he was fooling, but he figured he'd worked hard to get where he was and had earned a bit of laziness here and there. Jim was Programme Manager for a family of airport flight information products. The 'boards' that show you if the flight is on time and what gate it's arriving at were just a small part of what they did. What was really needed was a complete integrated information system that connected the arrivals & departure times, passenger check-in details, baggage handling and full airport information. The beauty of what they did was the integration of otherwise seperate systems that gave the airport management much more control and analysis and increased efficiency and therefore profits. Tim was Product & Marketing Manager for their suite of systems. Together they decided and delivered the companys product line and roadmap. Tim steered the direction and Jim made sure it happened. They had been working together in the role for the last 2 years and they were a good combination. They were both “can do” kind of people, and when the other managers and senior engineers told them they were dreaming, they just knuckled in, solved the problem, and did it. Of course, it wasn't the easy way, but Jim in particular had built up a good team around them. They had spent a lot of effort engendering a team spirit that fostered individual empowerment and a real sense of family. They were proud that after inheriting the team with the lowest morale in the company, they had rapidly turned it around to become the “star” division that everyone wanted to be a part of. But more importantly, they were proud that not only was it a team in good spirits, it was a team at peak performance, and they knew that they could face the customers and make promises that would be delivered on where others couldn't. It was a good feeling! But it took effort. Most managers couldn't be bothered, but to Jim it was worth it. He hardly did anything except talk to customers, suppliers and to his team. Actually, it was his best place to be – he had no real talent for the engineering or product strategy, but he knew how to get the best of the people who did. “Wind them up and set them loose” was one of his mantra's. Right at the moment they were working on the next new development. The world wanted smaller, faster, cheaper, more powerful & more integrated. Always. The pace of development never slowed, and Jim's team was pounding the R&D treadmill driven by smaller, faster, more capable micro-processors and other associated integrated circuits or “chips” as they called them. Tim's message confirmed to Jim that they had received approval from their boss to take their next proposed product off the drawing board and into the real world. An important new customer in India had a need for a unique version of their regular product line that combined some features not normally mixed together in the same system. Normally they knew it would not be economically viable to develop such a product for one market specifically, but Tim figured that this one was what they called a “trend breaker”, and once the rest of the market cottoned on to the idea, that it would sell like hot cakes. Plus, India was a big enough market on it's own that they would get the return on investment from this one project – just. They had planned for Tim to visit the customer to make sure they understood exactly all their application issues and requirements, while Jim would “sell” the idea to their counterparts in the Japan head office. While Tim had already discussed the concepts with his Tokyo based Product Manager counterparts, they had learned that in order to make sure the product was correctly delivered into the lucrative and techno-hungry Japanese market in parallel with the new market in India, it required a physical visit to talk through all the co-ordination issues, plan the work schedule and market release. Through lots of hard work, Jim & Tim had built up the relationships and reputation of success in Japan that meant they could now rely on parallel introduction of prototypes to their colleagues in Japan and their early adopter partners in the market. If the product survived the quality focussed testing that they insisted on, they knew it would be a success everywhere. Without the parallel support, the new product would take longer to test on their own and the decreased market base meant the product would probably not be viable. Therefore as good an idea as it was, it would languish on the drawing board. No presure, Jim thought! But it was what they did every day – the kind of challenge that got them out of bed in the mornings. “Good news hon,” Jim said as he stowed his bogu bag in the cupboard when he got home, “you get the bed to yourself next week! Tim just told me we've got the go ahead for the new product so he's off to Mumbai and me to Japan. We'll finalise the details tomorrow but probably be just the week for me.” Jim's wife Jane, had gotten used to the short notice calls away. Luckily she was practical about such departures and, favouring the bright side, looked forward to having the bed to stretch out in all by herself. Throwing his towel over his shoulder, Jim picked up his bag and exited the shower. It was good they had the shower at work – it made biking in not so much of an issue, as he just had his morning shower after he arrived. Walking through his teams area to his desk in the corner, Jim chatted to the few people who were either already there or just arriving. Since he always liked to lead by example he was usualy one of the first there. Today there was only Luke there checking the report generated from the overnight test suite that was running on one of their current prototypes. Luke was one of Jim's “lieutenants”, a young and up-coming Software Engineer until Jim had recognised some organisational qualities in him and promoted him into a Team Leader role. “Morning tosser! How's it going this morning? Is that overflow bug fixed now?” “Seems to be, boss. No sign of that particular error code this morning, and what's more I think I've got an angle on that intermittant glitch we've been having. It looks like the watchdog goes off only sometimes, but only ever when one of the power feeds is switched on or off. Look at the timing here.” Jim looked at the report on the test computer screen where Luke was pointing interpreting the time stamp and status messages. “Yeah, looks like it – well spotted chief! Now we just need to figure out why. I bet, since it's only sometimes, and only from PSU on or off, that maybe it's a ground or power rail bounce at the processor, or watchdog chip. Maybe the chip is more susceptible than it's supposed to be, or maybe the hardware boys haven't decoupled it enough, but either way I suggest you show Howard and see if he can pick up anything with the 'scope, or come up with a better theory.” He looked again at the readout. “Actually mate, look here – it's only ever when the alternate PSU is switched. See here, here & here, PSU1 is switching and it's fine, and here and here PSU2 is switched and you've got the fault. I wonder if it's not the chips susceptiblity, but the circuit board power planes from PSU2 – maybe they're too skinnyfor the length of track – high resistance, causing a voltage glitch. Anyway, whatever it is, Howard will find it with that clue. That's a good find – knowing where to start looking is most of the battle.” Jim knew just enough about the various aspects of product engineering, manufacturing processes, and the typical supplier and logistic issues to be able to ask the questions that got the specialists to think along the lines that solved the problems. He didn't consider himself smart at all, but through his guidance, his teams solved the problems that others struggled with, and Luke was starting to learn the same skills. Jim was doing his thinking out loud as a training exercise for Luke. “Sure will boss, and I'll make sure to compliment Jamal on sussing the overflow bug.” Luke always referred to Jim as “boss” and Jim called him “chief”. It was their private joke. If they ever referred to the other by their real name it usually meant something serious was coming! The exception was the occasions when Luke and the others called him “Jim-san”. This was their sign of respect name for him as a result of the improved relationship with their Japanese colleagues. It was one of their many “in” jokes – they had a lot of them – Jim had fostered the team spirit specifically along a fun path. “Oh, by the way, Tim & I are on the move this weekend. Valkyrie has the nod to proceed. I'll have Joan sort the flights today. You can hold the fort while I'm away.” They had recently started using mythological beings for their project codes. The team had chosen Valkyrie for the India product – probably because the Tom Cruise movie of the same name had recently been released. “Sure thing boss, no worries, but I don't envy Tim India. At least you'll be more comfortable in Japan.” “Actually,” Jim replied, “I was thinking on the bike on the way in that I should probably tag along to India as well. We'll have a problem with the dual power supply and I'm thinking that it would be more efficient, cheaper and faster time to market for the customer if we use a local India-based PSU manufacturer and have them integrate the system from the factory with the PSU's. I've got a couple of possible suppliers lined up and want to scope them out & talk it over with them before deciding on that. Plus you know Tim's gonna need me along to keep him out of trouble!” “Delhi-belly in Mumbai eh?” laughed Luke. “Don't you want it to be like Taiwan all over again?” “I don't want him promising your first born to the customer – you know what he's like!” Jim replied heading to his desk. Dumping his bike clothes and gear on the hanger by his desk, Jim poked his laptop into life, letting it boot up while he tidied away the clothes, his papers he'd taken home and his lunch. He logged in and checked the intranet “In/Out page” to see if Tim was in yet. He needed to plan their trip and see if he agreed with both of them going to India together before they took it to Chris to OK. No sign of Tim yet, so he checked the overnight emails. Within ¼ hour he had scanned them all, forwarded the ones he could delegate and flagged the ones he had to deal with personally. They could wait 'til later, if he was going to be on a plane in the weekend, that one took priority! He was just about to check the In/Out page again when he noticed the unmistakable shape of Tim heading his way. “Tim-san!” he hailed. “How's my favourite Programme Director today Jim-san?” Tim responded. “Looking forward to a new experience – I haven't been to India yet.” “What, you think you need to hold my hand to keep me out of trouble?” “Kind-of.” replied Jim, “but if the truth were known, it's really so you don't make any rash promises to the customer.” “You are wise and knowledgeable Jim-san and you know me too well!” “Actually,” Jim explained, “I really think the timeline is going to be a problem for them and if I'm there we can work the development and prototype schedule around their needs. Plus, the PSU is going to be a problem. I was thinking we can use one of the local Indian PSU manufacturers and speed up the process and reduce the costs if they don't have to ship the PSU's to China only to be shipped back again. I reckon we can have one of the factory guys set up a test process for the PSU manufacturer and then box them in our packaging just as they'd be from our factory. India quality for India customers. All the rest of the world (ROW) unit PSU's can ship to the factory and be tested there so we can ensure Japanese quality for the ROW product. It wouldn't work if the PSU was going to be fixed internally, but this one has both units as hot-swap modules so they'll be packaged, shipped & sold seperately so it will be fairly easily to co-ordinate logistically.” “and as for my trip to Japan,” Jim continued, “I think it's better if you're there for that too as you can sell the application much better than I can. I'll do the project schedule and engineering stuff while you talk to the marketing stuff. If we do it on the way back from India, we have all the latest details from the customer, PSU vendor and our planning on the plane. From India to Japan is a relatively low extra cost and you know we always want as much time as we can get in the Tokyo office.” “You make a strong case Jim-san.” Tim agreed. “And that's without the whole taking-care-of-Tim-san after local Indian food and a night out with the customer act that you just know is gonna be needed!” retorted Jim. “Yessss!!” exclaimed Tim gleefully, “the Tim-&-Jim travelling circus is on the road again! It's been far too long!” “Yes Tim-san – as long as Chris agrees. Let's hit him up for it now so Joan has time to get the bookings in place.” “You know he's just going to rubber stamp it – as long as we both agree it's necessary he's gonna back us all the way.” “Well, maybe, but let's get that little formality out of the way so I can rearrange my life once again for you.” “Yo, big fella!” Jim waved to Tim from his place in the queue at check-in. For a change, Tim was pretty much on time, and strolled over to join Jim just as the Business Class check-in attendant motioned him forward. When you live such a long way from the rest of the world, any trip is going to be a long one necessitating the extra cost of Business Class to take advantage of the lie-flat beds and the shower in the airport lounges, to allow them to hit the ground running reasonably fresh. “Good morning gentlemen.” she smiled a greeting “Where to today?” “Mumbai” replied Jim handing over his e-ticket and passport. “Come on Tim-san, sort your mud out, the lady's waiting for you.” “Yeah, yeah” Tim exclaimed “I'm coming, I'm coming.” “So's christmas.” retorted Jim. “Hi Jim, look after my husband for me won't you?” said a voice from behind him. “Helen!” exclaimed Jim giving her a hug “Of course I will – you know that's my primary mission in life. Plenty of others have given up on that job, but you know I'm a sucker for those lost-cause charity cases!” The check-in attendant watched the back and forth banter with amusement. It was obvious the trio were good friends who had a healthy respect for each other. She marked their boarding passes for “good guy” attention. “Here you are gents, I've got you in the center row right in front of the galley, with a spare seat between you. The plane's lightly booked, so that seat won't be filled. You can use it to spread out & leave your in-flight gear on it after take off. Your bags are checked right through to Mumbai.” “Thank you very much” Jim replied “We appreciate it – I don't want to be too close to him – he smells & he snores!” She laughed as they took their boarding passes and passports. “Have a good trip.” she added as they headed off towards immigration. As they walked, Jim dug into his carry-on bag and pulled out a package. “Here you go Tim-san. Can't break the tradition now.” Helen intercepted it and checked inside the bag. It was the latest Dan Brown book “The Lost Symbol”. When Tim climbed on a plane he liked to read. Clive Cussler was usually his author of choice but this time around Jim hadn't been able to find a new one that Tim hadn't already read. When they'd started travelling together, Jim had quickly noticed Tim's ritual and had started the tradition of buying the latest book for him. With the long flight times, Tim would usually finish the book by the time they reached their destination and would need to buy another for the return leg, and if for some reason he couldn't get anything suitable, he'd often be grumpy all the rest of the trip, so Jim figured it was an investment in his own sanity to make sure he always had some reading material. “Sorry it's different this time Tim, but even with others helping, the guy just can't write them as fast as you read them.” teased Jim, “I thought you might like this one instead – I already read it!” “Wouldn't want you breaking the budget Jim” replied Helen. “At least this one doesn't appear to be about ships!” “No ships in this one Helen – this is a 'real' author, so he'll just have to make do this time!” quipped Jim. “Just because you guys don't appreciate fine literature, doesn't mean you have to drag down the master” retorted Tim. Jim chuckled. “Master of regurgitated sea shanties – there's no skill in that Tim-san! Right-o, end of the line Helen. Say good-bye to my man, and no excessive PDA – there's kids around.” Helen poked her tongue out at Jim and snuggled in to Tim “I'll Publicly Display my Affection any time I like thank you very much Mr McCully, and if you're not careful I'll go all PDA on you too!” Jim laughed giving her a very brief one-armed hug and waved over his shoulder as he stepped towards the immigration booth at the departure gate. “Don't worry Helen, I'll take good care of him – just like always. Be good 'til we're back.” Tim wrapped his wife in a real hug and gave her a quick kiss. “See you later sweets. I'll call when we get there.” She watched them both go through the gate and onto the escalator to go up to the Business Class lounge, the same as she'd done numerous times before. They all waved to each other – no big deal. These days getting into a large metal tube and thundering into the sky along with a few hunded other people travelling thousands of miles to another country, another civilisation, was no big deal. Every single day, all around the world, millions of people were doing it. And considering how unnatural it all was, it was statistically a lot safer than hopping into a car. But still, no big deal notwithstanding, she always had a small worry nagging away at the back of her head at this point, waving goodbye. As he always did while running, Jim replayed the high points from the latest problem or the previous day through his mind, analysing, problem solving and prioritising.He always thought he did some of his best thinking while running – there was plenty of time to run the various “what-if” scenarios through his mind so that by the time he finished, he usually had a pretty well thought out solution or line of attack to follow. He was 20 minutes into his pre-breakfast run and decided it was time to turn around and head back. He wanted to leave a safety margin for the unfamiliar locale. It was his first run in India. Part of his ritual – eat too much in Business Class and the airport lounge, so go for a run before the day's business started. It wasn't just for the exercise, it would also allow him to experience a little more of the local sights, sounds and smells than he'd otherwise be exposed to as well as trying to beat off the effect of the excess food & drink. In a new place, depending on the street density and lay of the land, he usually either went “out and back” which was a compromise between playing it safe on the 'getting-lost-in-strange-country' front, but not so great on the 'maximising-new-scenery' front since the “back” view was the same as the “out” view, but it was safer than the alternative “round-about” method where he tried to run a circuit with the hotel at the centre. Unless there was a good set of landmarks in relation to the hotel, the “out and back” method usually won out, although one time in Tokyo, he'd gone on a nominally “out and back” run from the hotel in Shinagawa towards the Tokyo Tower and then coming back via different streets. He almost came unstuck but the Japanese are a very helpful race and he only had to ask one person for directions before he was back on track. Since that run however, he now took with him a small “bum-bag” with his cellphone, some cash and a map if possible or at least directions for a taxi driver to get him back to the hotel. Today he was going slower than usual. India was just packed full of people! So concentrating hard, he turned around and headed back exactly the same way he'd come. He was thinking about yesterday's meeting – the first one with the customer. Tim had picked up a few more salient details about the configuration they were going to be using it in and the end job it was going to do and was changing the list of features as a result. They confirmed they had desperate need and Jim was now figuring out how they could fit the prototype schedule around their needs. There was some tie in with the PSU in this regard so today he was going to see his two most promising suppliers. A couple of blocks away from the hotel he came to a stop. The way ahead was blocked by a seeming riot of people. There was a blockage in the road – it looked like there had been an accident but who knew for sure – it could have been the normal street bustle for all he knew. The guy with the donkey cart seemed to be the guilty party, pushing and pulling at the poor beast's lead rope to get the cart moving again, but it seemed to Jim that the wheel on the cart had seized hence why the donkey was having a problem getting the cart moving again. Jim wondered whether he should divert off his safe path around the obstruction, or wait for it to clear. Being the calculated risk taker, and hater of inaction that he was, he decided to take a deteor – new sights after all. Half an hour and a few more detours than he had expected later, he was finally back on track and one block away from the hotel – well and truly later than he'd planned. In his bum bag, he heard and felt his cellphone ring. He unzipped the bag and flipped the phone open. It was Tim. “Hey sleeping beauty” Jim answered “I'm about half a block away – damn Indian traffic and confusing civic architechture is slowing me down.” “Still far too keen for my liking Jim-san” replied Tim “I've just about finished breakfast and was missing my travel buddy.” “Yeah right!” retorted Jim “How's life back home? What is it – jut after lunch there?” “Yeah, about 2pm. Helen said cooler than here – surprise, surprise! She said… ” there was a pause “hang on, … oh shit! … ” Tim's voice broke off in a howl of static. At the same time Jim was knocked off his feet by a ferocious blast of light and sound as a column of dust and debris rocketed out from the direction of the hotel. Picking himself up, Jim pocketed the cellphone and started running faster and faster towards the hotel, dreading, but knowing deep down with a sinking certainty what he was going to find. Sure enough, as he rounded the corner of the block he saw the hotel – the reception and restaurant area was no longer walled – it was broken and buckled and spread all over the place. And dotted all around were the crumpled shapes of people. Some of them moving, others ominously still. Shit! Shit! Shit! Where was Tim? Jim dashed towards the remains of the restaurant scanning the area for Tim. Others were moving in to the area as well now. Hotel staff and police from off the street. Jim's ears had been ringing from the blast, but now he started to hear the moans of the injured and the whistles and shouts of the people coming in to help. He heard a strange voice calling out for Tim, and realised that it was his voice. It sounded panicked – and he'd never been panicked before. But then again he'd never been this close to an explosion before either. Sudenly he saw him. Half buried under a table and some stones from the wall, was the head and shoulders he thought he knew. Racing over he jerked the rubble off the prone form and turned him over. It was Tim alright, and it was equally obvious that he was gone. With his forehead smashed in from one of the rocks Tim was not going to be getting out of this one with him. Jim's legs seemed to collapse and he thunked down to sit beside the crumpled body of his mate. Right now he wasn't thinking or problem solving. Right now he was just pure emotional reaction. Tears streaming down his face he arched his head back and screamed straight up at the sky a long gutteral moan that wrenched itself out from the depths of his guts. Then slowly he forced control back into his body. Nothing was going to help Tim now. Now all he could do was live, and start doing the things that must be done. He was a problem solver. He was a do-er. He flipped open his phone and started doing. “Hi hon, how's India today?” Jane answered after a couple of rings. After a long pause Jim responded with deep feeling and a shaky voice “It's shit. God I love you.” Jane instantly knew something very very bad had happened. “What's wrong hon?” After a long pause he answeed. “There's been an explosion. Tim's dead.” his voice caught and he couldn't help sobbing a bit, but he fought back the control. “I'm ok, but it's a mess here. Can you go around to Helen's place and call me when you get there. I need to tell her but I'd really like you to be there to give her some support. It's gonna be a real piece of shit for her.” Jane's mind was racing with a hundred questions churning around in her head, but she was a very practical women. She knew that Jim must be physically ok so the details could wait. She knew Helen had to be told and Jim would want to be the one to do it. He would feel responsible. “Oh my god” she said. “You're sure?” “I'm sitting here in the wreckage of the hotel beside his dead body.” Jim said “I'm sure.” Then he added “Jesus hon, I was only 2 minutes away … ” A stab of icy shock streaked up her spine and Jane's mind almost went numb with the shock of it. Bloody hell – she'd almost lost her husband. And then she realised that Helen had. And she knew she had to go. “Ok then. I'm leaving now to go to Helen's. I'll call you on the doorstep – about 15 mins time OK? I love you – BE SAFE. OK??” “Ok” was all he could muster. “thanks hon.” and he flipped the phone shut. After a few more minutes sitting there, he sighed and flipped the phone open again and started the first of the many calls he would make that day. There were practical things to do – meetings and flights to reschedule, a body to move back home, a funeral to arrange, and Valkyrie and the other projects still had to be completed. Life goes on. “Hello Ann speaking.” Ann was the HR Director and a good friend of Jim & Tim. While Jim had seen many in the HR profession acting in unhelpful ways, Ann was the embodiment of what the role can do for an oganisation. She had made some dramatic changes for the good and in the process had gained their trust and friendship. “Hi Ann, it's Jim. I really need your help. It's as bad as it can be – Tim's just been killed. A terrorist bomb most likely. I was 2 minutes away from being in it myself.” There was a stunned silence from Ann for a bit and then she responded. “Oh my god Jim, I'm so so sorry. Are you sure about Tim? Are you sure you're alright? When did it happen?” “About 10 minutes ago. I'm sitting beside his body in the wreckage of the hotel – I'm sure. I need you to co-ordinate for me. Get Luke to help. We need to get the word out to the team, we'll need to change our flight schedule, I'll need a new hotel I guess – I'm going to stay here until I can bring his body back.” Ann heard the deep wrenching sorrow in his voice and knew how hard it must be for him to hold it together while doing what needed to be done. She pictured him sitting there in the wreckage of a terrorist bombing. As much as she liked Tim and wanted to give in to the shock and sorrow herself, she was also a strong and practical woman and her mind was on the living. “Be careful Jim – is the area safe? There may be a follow-up attack. You should get out of there – go to the NZ Embassy – you'll need their help bringing Tim home anyway.” “I'm not leaving him. I promised Helen I'd look after him – I'm responsible.” “Jim,” she said gently “he's gone, and it's not your fault. You have to look after yourself now. You're no good to Helen or any of us if anything happens to you now.” Then she added into the silence “Does Helen know?” “I've got Jane on her way around there now, as soon as she gets there she'll ring me and I'll tell her – I owe it to her.” Jim replied. “Jim, remember - it's not your fault, but later on she'll appreciate you doing that. I'll set everything in motion here and then go around to Helen's as well – I think Jane will need the support too – how do think she's feeling having almost lost her husband too and then feeling guilty that she didn't while Helen did?” “Why us Ann? Why here, why now?” Jim asked the unanswerable with a deep deep sigh and his voice breaking in a sob. “Look thanks for taking care of it. I'd better go – Jane might be at Helen's and trying to call. I'll talk to you later.” “Take good care Jim” was all she could think of to say. Jim clicked the call off. After just sitting head bowed for a few minutes Ann's words about follow-up attacks registered. He looked carefully around at the destruction and the people moving around in it. In the news reports and movies about terrorist attacks, there often were follow-up attacks – sometimes the attackers diguised as rescuers for maximum effect. He didn't know how to deal with that just yet other than taking care of things himself. A policeman made his way over towards him. “Are you all right? How about your friend?” he asked concern, shock, and blood on his face. “I'm ok and my friends beyond help. Go help someone else.” Jim snapped at him. As the policeman moved on through the rubble, Jim's phone vibrated in his hand and started to ring. Glancing at the screen he saw it was Jane and he took a deep breath. This was going to be one of the hardest calls of his life and he still didn't know what he should say to Helen. “I'm here Jim” said Jane “God, are you sure you're ok? All sorts of things have been going through my mind on the way over.” Jim could hear a note of panic in her voice. “I'm fine, honestly. Some cuts and bruises is all. Now, can you go inside and hand me over to Helen?” he said gently. He could hear her crunch her way up the gravel path, knock and open the door. “Helen” she called out as she went in. He heard Helen “Hi Jane, what a surprise” and then she must have sensed something was wrong and Jim heard her say “what's wrong?”. Jim imagined Jane handing her the phone. “Helen? Hi Helen” he said “What's up Jim?” a note of caution registered in her voice. Jim got straight to the point figuring that she was starting to figure out something was dreadfully wrong “It's Tim. I failed you Helen – he's gone. There was an explosion at the hotel while I was out running. Tim must have been right in the middle of it. I'm right beside him now. I'm really really sorry – we've lost him.” He couldn't help it – telling Helen was too hard, it all came out and he started to cry. Helen didn't answer. The phone had slipped out of her hand and she dropped to the floor. Jane crouched down beside her and wrapped her arms around her as she started to scream and cry. “Noooooo! No, no, no!!!” she wailed. Half a world away, Jim was feeling much the same way. Helen's grief triggered his own and he let it come, great heaving sobs wracking his body as he crouched beside the lifeless body of his friend. Subconciously he flipped the phone shut – there was nothing more to say – even if anyone was listening. Jim stared out across the shimmering tarmac. Colourful airplanes moved busily around, landing, taxiing, taking off. The iconic control tower of Singapore's Changi airport loomed behind the terminal buildings in the distance and the heat pressed in on him from the leaden sky of another pending monsoon shower. He was airside, over by one of the freight hangars, sitting beside the transport coffin of his friend waiting for their connecting flight to be readied for the last leg home. He'd been through Changi often, and he'd even been airside with their work projects, but he'd never seen it from this perspective. The mechanisms of one of the worlds busiest airports was fascinating and normally would have captured his full attention, but Jim saw none of it except as peripheral activity, almost disconnected events. He was still operating like a robot – acting as required but largely numb. He felt unnatural, strange - like half of him was missing. But he couldn't completely break their traditions – he pulled out of his bag the battered Clive Cussler book, opened it and started reading the story out loud – to Tim. However, he found his reading patchy. He couldn't concentrate on the words. Too many random thoughts were racing through his mind – fragments of memories from previous trips with Tim, snatches of the practical world that he still had to deal with as life went on all around him, the next steps in the logistics of bringing Tim home and the funeral arrangements … There was too much to think of and he was still too weary and uncaring to focus. Putting the book down, he picked up his phone. “Hi Hon, just checking in. We're at Singapore. Just waiting for the connecting plane.” “How is everything?” Jane asked. She heard the flatness in his voice and was woried. Jim was not one to show a lot of emotion. The mere fact that in the last few days he had called her several times a day and not said much of any consequence meant that he was taking Tim's death hard. Usually when he was on a trip, he hardly ever called – a couple of times during the whole trip – certainly not a couple times a day. Not that she minded this time – until he got back she was going to be worried all the time – a close brush with death will do that for you she guessed. “Had some red tape problems but the Embassy guys took care of it. How's Helen?” “Not too good” Jane told him. “The doctor's got her on a sedative at night so she gets some sleep, but during the day she's like a zombie.” “Are you still camping out there?” “Yes, and Ann has been by every day as well. She's brought a grief counsellor along too, but I'm not sure if she's doing any good or not.” “How are the boys?” “They're fine. Big teenage boys – no problem. It's not like they really knew Tim.” Jim sighed. He was doing a lot of sighing these days – circular breathing – clear the mind. It wasn't working too well though – his mind was a whirling chaos of unhelpful questions. “Ok, well I'll be home soon. It's SQ297 by the way - see you tomorrow around 10:30. Love you.” She could tell he meant it more than usual “Love you too. Keep safe.” He flipped the phone shut. After a couple of minutes gazing into the leaden sky, Jim sighed again and flipped open the phone again. “Hi Ann” “Hi Jim, how are you?” Ann answered softly. “How do you think?” he answered flatly. “How's everything going back there? Has Luke got everything under control?” “Everything's fine Jim, stop worrying about us and worry about you. You sound like shit.” Jim gave a harsh laugh “You always know how to compliment a guy don't you?! But I guess you're right – I've got a lot of no good thoughts on my mind recently.” “Well lose them. Stop kicking yourself - it wasn't your fault.” “I know that, but it doesn't put life back in Tim's body. I can't stop the 'what-if's' and 'why's' – why him, why not me, why blow up anyone … why? why why why?” Ann replied gently “You know there's no answer for that Jim. Shit happened and we just have to go on around it. Look, when you get back I've got some red wine here with our name on it. You need to take some time out.” “Still trying to get me to burn my Leave total eh Ann?” Jim replied with a wry laugh, “We'll see. There's a lot more for me to do now with Tim gone.” “And there's plenty of other people in the team who can do it. That's what you & Tim built – now you can sit back and watch it work while you get yourself sorted out.” retorted Ann. She knew Jim exceedingly well and had discussed how to help him with the grief counsellor. She was going to have to play good cop/bad cop all by herself being gentle one minute and firm the next. “Jim, trust me – everything here is fine and under control. Half of the Japanese office will be here later tonight, Nick's already arrived from Australia, and Toyotami-san is en-route from Milan. We'll see you on the tarmac when the plane lands. The captain will bring you down the crew ladder from the air bridge and we'll be there waiting.” Jim paused and sighed again “Ok. Thanks Ann, I really appreciate this.” “No problem – you're not the only person who can organise stuff you know!” Ann replied softly again. “Take care of yourself and get some sleep on the plane. We'll see you soon.” The line clicked off and Jim hung up and flipped his phone shut. She really was the best he reminded himself again. He thought about ringing Helen, but instantly dismissed the thought. He still didn't know what to say to her. He'd see her tomorrow, and he wasn't looking forward to it. As the 747 nudged to a stop and it's engines wound down, Jim unsnapped his seat belt and stood up. He got his carry on bag out of the overhead locker and then sat back down again to wait. Almost immediately the Chief Purser arrived at his seat and asked him to come forward. When he arrived at the front door, the captain was waiting for him and straight away led him out the aircraft door into the air bridge, but instead of going along the “tube”, he handed Jim a yellow high-vis vest and a pair of air defenders, then opened the crew door in the side by the controls and led the way down the steps to the tarmac below. Off to the side of the gaggle of ground-crew, baggage trolleys and the aircraft tug, Jim could see the reception party – Jane, Helen, Ann, Luke, Nick, Toyotami-san and 2 strangers in black suits standing beside a hearse. As the captain led Jim towards the aft cargo hold, one of the groundcrew drove a mobile platform forward to meet them. The tarmac supervisor motioned to the reception party and they came out on the tarmac towards Jim. He went forward to meet them and enveloped Jane and Helen in a wordless threeway hug. They all lost their composure, weeping together. After a couple of minutes Jim could feel the hands of the others on their shoulders, patting, pressing – ofering silent support. No-one said anything. There was no need. The all knew what they meant. After a while, as they watched the crew manoevering Tim's coffin onto the mobile platform, Toyotomi-san broke the silence. “You brought him home Jim-san – that's all anyone could expect.” As the last notes of the song died out, Jim reached the pulpit at the front of the funeral chapel. He looked out at the sea of faces in front of him, then glanced over to the coffin containing his friend. “That song “Daniel” wasn't really one of Tim's favourite songs. He was more into the metal we heard from Axel Rose before. In fact I think he thought Elton John was a bit of a wimp, but that one is a song that the 'Tim & Jim travelling circus', as he called us, used to perform as a karaoke duet on our global travels together. Some of you here today from Japan and Taiwan will have had the dubious pleasure of hearing it performed in the small hours of an evening when the shochu was flowing free.” Jim glanced over at the small crowd of their work colleagues who had made the trip from Japan and Taiwan to pay their respects. Toyotomi-san, Junichiro-san, and Toko-san smiled knowingly and nodded as their minds rolled back to some of the after-work gatherings they had had. Work hard, play hard, was one of the mantra's Toyotomi-san had instilled in all his senior team members. “Thank-you - 'Arigatou'. For coming all this way to say good-b… ” his voice tailed off and broke. He couldn't yet bring himself to say the word. He gripped the edges of the pulpit and strangely enough the solidness of the smooth wood biting into his palms did help calm and ground him. Drawing a deep breath, Jim continued. “Tim was my friend. He had a lot of friends, as you can tell from the numbers here today, but somehow, he made me feel I was more of a friend than everyone else. I think he did that with everyone mind you, so why am I the one up here? I guess because I'm the last friend that Tim had when he was taken from us – I was talking to him when it happened, and if it wasn't for a silly indian and his broken-down donkey-cart, I might well have been lying there beside him.” Jim paused and looked around the room but now the crowd of people was a blur and the only face he could make out was Helen. He knew that she was flanked by Ann on one side and Jane on the other but he couldn't see their faces. Or perhaps, more accurately, he wouldn't let himself make out their faces. “Life is a mystery.” Jim went on “No-one knows why, or how long we will live for. Sometimes there doesn't seem to be a purpose, and sometimes there does. Tim seemed to have a purpose though. He enjoyed what he did, and he enjoyed at the end of it, going back to Helen. I used to give him grief about it, but Tim loved her more than anything else, and now, all I can think about is that she will be so alone, and I can't help feeling responsible. I'm so sorry Helen that I couldn't take care of him this time.” Jim stopped with a tear in his voice and in his eyes. Then with an angry swipe at his face, he continued. “Hate.” … deep breath, … “Hatred is a powerful force that can unite a multitude. You see, we are all united by hatred here today. Hatred caused someone to strap a bomb on to their body and go out to kill a bunch of strangers. And today, I bet, each and every one of us feels an element of hatred for the people who made this happen and snatched Tim away from us just as he was really getting into his stride and enjoying life.” “But, we cannot live properly if we let this hate take us. We do not honour Tim's life if we give in to the hate. Tim loved life and he would not want us to squander the rest of our days in fear and hatred. So, while it might be hard, for Tim's sake, we need to push the hate down. Down, into a little ball way down there, take a deep breath, and smile, and remember the good times, and the good things. And live each day as if it were our last – in happiness, and remembering the good times.” “I am sure I will need to be reminded of this myself, because already I miss him, and feel sad that he's not here to enjoy this lovely day and this gathering of all the people he loved, but we have to, or else he gave us nothing, and I know my friend gave me something.” “At work, he gave me the freedom to operate – I trusted him to steer the product direction and he trusted me to deliver it. He made truly wild promises to the customers – he did, didn't he? But he did because he felt he could rely on the rest of us to do the imposible – and each time we did! But it wasn't an unhappy grind because in the process, he gave me and the team a whole lot of fun. He challenged us to meet the bar he set for us and he helped make sure we could meet the challenge. I have never worked with another person who operated this way and I doubt I ever will again.” “But I'm going to miss the most his greeting. He had the knack to say your name as a greeting, and make it sound like he hadn't seen you in a million years and now that you were with him it was the best thing that had happened. You couldn't help but feel your spirits lift when he said it, and it set the tone for the rest of the conversation. It didn't matter how deep the shit, Tim was always cheerful and confident we could shovel our way out of it. I really only saw him down less than a handfull of times – and the shit was indeed VERY deep then! But I am really, REALLY, going to miss that “Jim-san!”. I think we all will.” He paused again and suddenly he felt very drained. He'd planned a lot more to say – all the funny stories of Tim's antics around the world and back home, but his mind was now blank. He breathed deep and gripped the dias again and regained some energy. He walked over to where his friend was resting and ran his hand over the smooth, shiny wooden case. “Goodbye Tim. You were always teaching me a lesson of some sort, but this one is going to take me a while to work out. Thanks for the memories – it was the best of times.” As he slowly returned to his seat, Jim heard the music start and the Monty Python “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life” took over to do what Tim would have done to lift the spirits of everyone gathered. Luke started joining in the chorus and the rest of the team picked it up – but not with their usual conviction. A quiet chorus of people trying to convince themselves. Soon everyone was standing and singing along – almost. Jim, Helen, Ann & Jane sat quietly holding hands with the weight of the world on their shoulders. The bugs were bothering him. Jim held his breath as he ducked through the tunnel of brush arching over the track. He was slogging up the bush covered hill at the old quarry which was his favourite running track, and the heat had congregated the fat-bodied flying fruit-flies at the juncture between hot and cold in the shadows at the entrance & exits to the areas where the bushy patches cloistered the track. As he neared the top and the incline of the hill increased, his pace slowed and he slowly dropped into a walk. Subconciously he noted he had started walking earlier than usual and figured he was out of practice. This was really his first run since the run in India - half a world and a whole lifetime ago. As was usually the case on his runs, Jim's thoughts ran wild, reviewing recent events, home life, work problems, things his friends had mentioned – a wide and varied stream of synapse connections. All of a sudden, Jim realised he was reliving a memory. He was recalling the conversation he'd had with Tim on the plane to Mumbai. Tim had put down the book Jim had given him and said “this whole Noetic science thing … what do you make of it Jim-san?” Jim had paused, stretched, and then pressed 'save' on the file he was working on and closed the lid of his laptop. Here was a topic he could get his teeth into! “Well, it's certainly interesting. You know I've always maintained that the power of the human mind was something we couldn't quite comprehend. Aborigines pointing the bone and the recipient shutting down and dying, the mother lifting the crashed car off her child, and the people given a death sentence from cancer who defied the odds and lived. Not so sure about the Yuri Geller types though!” “Yeah, well, it's a better theory than the christian church has.” Tim replied “You know we've been through the 'business of religion' discussion before” Jim said, “you got any new thoughts on the topic?” “Actually yeah, I have.” Tim responded. “You know last month when I was in Nepal, I got talking to our agent there about the whole subject. He's a Hindu, and he agreed about the 'business of religion' concept but was saying about 'faith' and what he believed. I got the feeling he/they were very tolerant of different beliefs, and for instance he said that while his wife liked to go to the temple every day and wanted him to go too, while he personally didn't agree with it, his attitude was that if it didn't hurt him and it made her happy then he went along with it.” “Well that's fine, but if he figured the temple was 'a business' did he have a 'faith'?” “I just said he was Hindu. He treated it as a faith seperate to a religion.” “So what's the belief? Heaven? Hell?” Jim was intrigued. “If I remember correctly, it was along the lines of do good things and you'll be all right. There wasn't really a heaven – they believe in reincarnation but when you achieve enlightenment, like the budda, you achieve oneness.” “Is that their version of heaven then?” said Jim “I guess so.” “And is there a god/creator figure?” “I guess so. He said they have this concept of 'zero' – when you achieve enlightment and then die, your spirit joins the rest of the spirits who have achieved enlightenment. Maybe these days we would call it a global consciousness or something. I got the impression it was kind of like infinite but nothing at the same time which is why they called it zero.” “What, so, at some point in time there was one, or a group, of spirit/spirits that created the world, and as time has gone by and some people have achieved enlightenment, they have joined the collective spirit creature/mass??” queried Jim. “That's the impression I got.” confirmed Tim. “I can't say I understood it then and we didn't have the chance to discuss it further. It's kind of fascinating though.” “Yerrrrr” said Jim thoughtfully. “So eternal damnation or heaven?” “Come on, you know that's the 'business of religion' working it's control factor. They believe you live your life and do your best to be a good person, and you'll be reincarnated at a suitable level for how you went. Eventually, if you keep working at it, you'll achieve enlightenment and join with zero.” Tim went on “it's a nice concept really.” “Hmmmm, yes.” answered Jim thoughtfully. “How do you think that fits with Noetic science? I checked it out on the web after reading the book. Some aspects seem to be like a business, but others truly seem to be trying to verify scientifically the power of the human mind. I guess, there's a fit with the Hindu view and the ultimate goal of 'zero'. Noetics was really saying that 'god' exists in each and every one of us, as long as we have the mind to unlock it.” Tim agreed “The Hindu, and Buddhist, belief in enlightenment really does seem to agree with the concept that god exists in each person.” Jim was thoughtful. “That's a little bit similar but yet quite different to the Japanese Shinto ancestor worship notion. There, when you die your spirit leaves the body and continues hanging around on earth. You need your living relatives to look after you in the spirit world putting offerings of food aside for you etc. If you achieved great deeds during your life you might become a god – like a mighty warrior becoming a god of war, but otherwise you needed your family to look after you. That's where the whole sense of duty in their society comes from – it's all leading up to duty to your ancestors so that when you join them in the afterlife your family would take care of you. It was a mix of faith and the business of religion.” He went on. “And the Korean belief is different again. One of the guys at Kendo told me that they have two heavens but no hell. There's a middle heaven where you go when you die. If you led a really good life helping people and being extra good you didn't stay in middle heaven very long but went straight up to the higher heaven where everything is perfect. If however you weren't so good you spend longer in middle heaven until you earn enough bonus points to get the upgrade as it were. But I don't know if this is a recent belief or the original, because I thought the Korean people were very similar to Japanese in following ancestor worship.” Tim said “well that explains some of the actions they take, but it's not as interesting a concept as the buddhist zero. I kind of like that one.” “Yeerrrrss” Jim responded thoughtfully, “but I think I'm going to need to find out some more about this before I can get my head around it fully.” Tim said “Yes. Norgay gave me a wee book about stories of the Buddha. Most of the tales seemed to be in the area of 'business of religion' rules and control. I pointed this out to Norgay and he said that of course there were people who would make anything into a religion rather than a faith, but if you looked at each story and message that the Buddha had given, there was lots of free choice there – take it or leave it kind of. For instance, the Buddha was saying that in order to achieve enlightenment, one should give away all their possessions and live the life of a beggar. But he also knew & said that if everyone did that then who would have the food to give to the beggars? And the world would fall apart, so that wasn't the only way to go. Indeed apparantly there were some followers of Buddha who did not give everything away but still managed to achieve enlightenment. I really need to read up some more about this.” Jim had said “You should talk to Ann – she loaned me the 'Tibetan Book of the Dead'. I haven't finished it but from the scan I gave it, and now that I think more about Noetics, it seems like there could well be a cross over there.” “Good idea.” said Tim. “A philosophical session with Ann sounds good. Some wine would be involved of course! And I might have to read up a bit more about Noetics. This idea that each person is a potential god is really quite powerful, and it would be interesting to see the differences & similarities between the Buddha's way and the modern science way.” “I'll see if I can find you a book on it for the return trip!” quipped Jim “But only if there isn't a new Clive Cussler - a mind trip instead of a rehashed rusty old boat trip!” The memory faded and Jim batted the midges away from his mouth and broke back into a trot as he broke out of the bush and neared the top of the ridge. He ducked off the side of the track and hauled himself up on top of a large outcrop of rock that looked out over the quarry. This was one of his 'secret' places. Most people didn't really know it was there and it had a spectacular view. He sat down on the outcrop with his feet dangling over the edge. For a while he just sat soaking in the warmth of the sun on his skin and also the heat of the rock spreading up through his body. The view of the distant houses merging into the city below and the countryside and mountains in the background set among the late spring flowering trees, shrubs and greenery helped soothe his mind. The conversation from the plane was still there in his mind, and the feeling of peace from his vantage point suddenly registered. Why on earth should he be alive to enjoy this moment and Tim wasn't? He wanted to scream and pound the rock but all of a sudden the words of Ann came to mind - “It's no-one's fault - shit happens and we have to go on.” With an effort, Jim forced his anguish down. Almost subconsciously he scooched back on the rock a bit and rearranging his legs, knelt down into seiza. He placed his hands one atop the other and made a circle under his navel - “mook-saaaaannnngggggg” he thought to himself as he practised the circular breathing from Kendo. As he breathed in, then out, his breathing slowed and his thoughts did too. Slowly he registered the warmth of the sun, the quiet background chirrup of the insects and birds, and the feeling of the peaceful surroundings. The swirling anguished thoughts disipated and while it wasn't 'no mind', his thoughts were still. He opened his eyes and looked out over the city and plains below him. It was almost like he was seeing it fresh for the first time. It really was a special view. “If Tim were here, he would've wanted a bottle of Waipara Valley Pinot Noir to enjoy it with!” Jim thought out loud and then he laughed. After a couple more seconds just sitting enjoying the view and the warm feeling of the sun on him, Jim pulled himself up and headed back to the track and back on course. Life went on, he thought. And all of a sudden he felt like it could – that it was ok to be alive and not to be stewing in a deep funk of unfairness. He almost thought he heard Tim's voice say “Come on Jim-san – harden up!” and laugh at him as he used to when turning Jim's saying back on him. His spirits lifted and he picked up his pace. It was going to be OK. As her ship crossed the orbit of the outermost sister planet, she thumbed the projector node and ended the report. Her earlier excitement was completely gone and despite having just woken from a good sleep, she felt incredibly drained and tired. Slowly she looked back out the translucent skin of her ship at the HUD-ennunciated marker that identified the planet of her concern. The analysis was thorough and the over-riding meaning from the messages contained among the plethora of RF signals emanating from the planet was umistakable. The intelligence teased out from the mass broadcast media and planetary-wide information network showed unmistakenly that the lifeform discovered was quite highly evolved, but it was a lost cause. For all their capability to control the planets resources, and reach beyond their own lands, the data showed her they were on a self-imploding path of destruction. And what was more worrying was that in the process of that self-destruction, she felt it was highly likely they would take the entire planet with them. She knew what had to be done. Getting up from her sleep platform, she moved through the ship to the flight station control centre. Setting herself into the central seat, she caused the control panel to form in front of her. Her long, slim fingers moved across the panel, setting in motion the chain of commands that would fix the current problem. Sensors swept the space ahead of them identifying every scrap of matter in the vicinity and feeding back to the ship their compositions, densities, locations and trajectories. A section of the wall became translucent and the HUD symbology picked out and highlighted certain objects that met the criteria she had defined. Projected paths of all the relavent items were projected in spiderweb thin laser light on the viewing and control pane surface. After scanning the data for a few seconds she made her choice. Digits flying now, she selected one tremendous piece of space rock which the HUD data identified as a fragment of a planet which had not formed. She manipulated her controls, causing a loud humming to commence and poweful beams to reach out towards the distant rock fragment. The beams insinuated their influence on the piece of ancient geology, pushing and prodding it to change it's course until the spidery trace of it's HUD-projected trajectory intersected the trajectory line of the jewel-like planet. With a final scan of her data, she snapped the beams off and sagged back into the padding of her couch. It was done. The rock was now on a collision course with the planet that worried her so. Within a few short days the giant rock would sweep in as a meteor blazing it's short-lived fiery path across the sky before smashing kilometers deep into the planet's crust unleashing the energy of a thousand atomic bombs in a gigantic fireball. Tons of the planets surface material would be thrown up into the atmosphere creating a sun-blocking curtain that would change the planet's weather pattern and climate irrepairably. The bi-pedal intelligent life-foms would try and stop the meteor from hitting their planet but their technology would not prevent the rock she had chosen. The size of a tiny moon, it could not be deflected from it's path or destroyed with their weapons. Her calculations showed that several millions of them would perish in the initial impact, heat & shockwave, while entire continents would be consumed by the tidal wave that followed, and the rest of them would perish over the ensuing years, due to the severe climate change brought on by the dust cloud. It was, as their own entertainment broadcasts showed, an extinction event. There was no other choice. They had had their chance. The evidence that her species had visited was visible in the historic data in the signals beaming off the planet. Over the recent thousands of their years, the more primitive societies of the planet had been visited from the stars, and they had recorded the visits subject to the limitation of their knowledge at that time. The attempts to steer them along the right path had failed - with the exception of their technology growth. But technology alone is not enough and the future projection was not good. She calculated that her work would rid the planet of the threat of this lifeform and simultaneously trigger the conditions to allow another one of the many and varied organisms that existed on the planet, to evolve into intelligence and start down the path that could result in a future meeting. She would likely not see such a meeting, but her mission would take her past other worlds with such possible meetings, and others of her kind would return to patrol this area of universe in the future. She had her mission. And she had hope. ",candidate00003
6,00001,candidate00004,"Unusual for an Australian house of the 1960s era, it had a cellar in which Gillian imagined keeping perishables. She wanted a cellar because the house design in “Modern Living” magazine, which she had read in the dentist’s waiting room, had one. But the kitchen, admittedly quite basic, had a large refrigerator so the cellar, she imagined, might come in handy once her husband could afford the wine to make it a wine cellar. Gillian liked the kitchen, at the centre of the house linked to the dining annex which she also thought of as a play area. A cleverly positioned room divider separated the kitchen and lounge room with its large floor to ceiling windows, the full width of the house. A three seater leather lounge and two armchairs were her pride of joy. Her father had made her a Tasmanian Blackwood coffee table and bookshelf. The house had a formal dining room and a small bedroom on the ground floor. Upstairs, three bedrooms with built-in wardrobes had views of the bush and the bay. The master bedroom had a luxurious floor to ceiling tiled ensuite bathroom and a walk-in wardrobe. In short, Gillian’s house was a modern, comfortable house for a modern family. Her friends admired the house very much for its open plan design and its clever use of space. Those who weren’t Gillian’s friends, called her A frame house “The Pyramid”. That was technically and geometrically incorrect, as Gillian pointed out. Envious, wagging tongues called her Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile, mostly behind her face. Gillian kept the house very tidy and true to her list, dusted on Wednesday afternoons, vacuumed the floor on Thursday and washed the kitchen and laundry floor on Saturday and smiled. At the Bowling Club annual dinner dance, which she attended to please her parents, Gillian was quite prepared to be bored stiff and sit the evening out because she was plain looking and wasn’t a very good dancer. A nice looking man, she soon found out his name, asked her for a dance, led her back to her table and quick as a flash, found another dance partner and showed off some fancy steps. He was tall, good looking, athletic and very sure of himself, Gillian thought. His name was Brian Mountjoy and he stood at the bar talking to her father, smiled and shook hands with a few people and caught her eye. He looked in Gillian’s direction again and she was pleased he did but did not like him dancing and chatting with other women. He smiled, walked over and made Gillian promise to save the last dance for him. She didn't know what to make of that move, but the disappointment on Brian’s face was plain to see when she left the club with her parents. She drifted off to sleep thinking of him, the way he had held her close and wished it had been closer. His cheek had been close to hers, trying to make conversation amid the noise of the band playing the Rolling Stones “I can’t get no satisfaction” and the noisy crowd singing along. Had he said as much? Had she said as much? No, Gillian decided. She would never admit to a lack of satisfaction, or would she? What would Brian do if she said so? How far would she let him go on their first date? Gillian was good at kissing if the experience with two boys and their say-so amounted to anything. Brian would be a good kisser, surely, and he was a man, not a boy. The more she thought about him, the more she wanted to feel his hands and would let him. Let him do what and where would they meet? Her mother answered the phone the Sunday after the dance and called Gillian to the kitchen. It was Brian and Gillian spoke to him for an hour from the extension in the lounge room. It didn't matter what Brian said. She couldn’t remember the conversation only his ever so smoky, so smooth and so sexy voice. Yes, they would have lunch on Monday. Gillian phoned her office from Brian’s flat to say that the food she had for lunch had given her an upset stomach and that she should be alright by the following day. Brian’s first kiss and touch had set her aflame and she explored his body and wanted all of him then and there. “I can’t get no satisfaction,” she whispered hungrily again and again. They spent a passionate afternoon and an exhausted Gillian took a cab home. Her mother looked at her as only mothers can and knew. Gillian went to her room, forgot about dinner, lay on her bed and put her hands to her face and body. Brian’s scent, his aftershave and sex were on her hands and on her body. She went to sleep wishing him next to her. She had become a woman that afternoon- Brian’s woman and she would see him again and be with him forever. They spent a weekend at Lakes Entrance where Brian revealed that he would have to go back to work in Bass Strait where he worked as a painter on an oil exploration platform. Gillian became part of his 10 days on-10 days off routine but living with his absence was made bearable by and having Brian around for an uninterrupted 10 days. Brian was angry, very angry at Gillian. Had she not taken precautions? It didn't matter to Gillian, for being pregnant was a joy and getting married was the logical next step, surely. Brian had no relations, well none he wanted to invite to a wedding and the bitterness in his voice made it clear that Gillian best avoid the subject. Brian wanted a Registry Office ceremony and Gillian, who had dreamt of a church wedding, reluctantly agreed to please him. Her mother looked on and her father and a mate of Brian’s acted as witnesses. The newlyweds spent a week at Lorne, which was not the Gold Cost honeymoon Gillian would have preferred, but she was married to Brian now and that, in itself, made her happy. The first few weeks at the flat were pleasant enough as they settled into a routine dictated by Brian’s work demands. It would all change, Gillian promised herself, once the baby was borne. Brian would look for a job locally, she would make him breakfast and lunch and he would be home evenings and weekends. He might, with her help, start a painting business with Gillian running the office. Then they could visit her parents more often, spend weekends at the shack, get a tan and watch the baby make sandcastles and play in the shallows. Quite unexpectedly, Gillian’s mother called at the flat one evening because, as her mother pointed out, the telephone had been disconnected. “I didn't want to trouble you at work. Your phone bill is long overdue.” “Brian pays all the bills, Mum,” Gillian explained. “He must have forgotten. I’ll pay.” “No need to, dear. You father will pay the bill. Do you have it handy?” Gillian explained to her mother that all their mail went to a post office box that Brian had kept on after they married. The following evening, Gillian answered a knock on the door. It was the landlord’s agent who handed her a business card, apologized for the intrusion, but as the rent was overdue because the cheque had been dishonoured and because letters had been returned ‘no longer at this P.O. Box’, he had no choice but to call in person. Gillian’s went to her bank the next day for cash to pay the back rent and a month in advance. She filled in the withdrawal slip and handed it and her cash card to the teller. He gave her a puzzled looked and then called for the manager: ”Is this a joke?” She nearly fainted when he told her that she had $1.19 in the account after $4,200 had been withdrawn in one transaction. The helpful bank manager spoke to her father who arranged to have her account topped up. Gillian feared the worst when her father asked her to come home for tea and ‘to sort a few things out’, as he put it. Gillian was in no fit state to drive home from her parent’s house that night after her father revealed to her and her shocked mother some disturbing news. Gillian’s credit card had been used for cash advances totalling $1,500. Her father had given Brian $2,500 of his own money to open an account at his bank. This amount was half the deposit needed to buy a two bedroom unit. Together with his savings, Brian had sufficient funds to secure a mortgage for a two bedroom unit. He had sworn Gillian’s father to secrecy as the purchase was meant as a surprise to celebrate the baby’s birth. Because her husband was not due home for two days, Gillian decided rather than wait and fret, to make enquiries. The real estate agent gave her the returned letter. It was addressed to Mr. B. Miller c/o a local post office box. The Postmaster revealed that he had cancelled the box because of non payment. There was further disturbing news when Gillian called at the exploration company’s head office. There was no history of a B. Mountjoy or B. Miller working on the company’s offshore platform. Gillian that evening searched the flat, every drawer, cupboard, wardrobe and shelf. There was nothing connecting her husband with the flat. An anxious Gillian waited for Brian’s footsteps and the sound of him whistling which told her he was in a good mood. He put his suitcase down, embraced her, swung her around gently as he always did and kissed her passionately. They went out for a counter tea and to the movies. “I had a bit of a scare with the baby,” she lied as they lay in bed awake. “I couldn’t even contact you because I have no phone number.” “Is the baby alright?” “Nothing to worry about, sweetie. Just in case I need you, who do I speak to at the company?” “Just leave a message for me at Port Welshpool. They’ll get in touch by radio.” But Gillian wasn’t that easily put off and asked: “In what name?” “What do you mean, what name?” “There is no B. Mountjoy working on the oil rig,” Gillian stated. “Or a B. Miller.” Brian turned away from her and that worried Gillian. His answer was slow in coming. “Oh that,“ Brian laughed it off. “I can explain. It’s a tax thing. I work two jobs. Seven days on the platform and three days in Lakes Entrance painting. It’s simply a case of dodging tax.” Gillian didn't believe his explanation but avoided probing for fear of more dubious explanations or worse: making her husband angry. They had never argued, never had there been any ill feeling between them. She loved her husband and wanted him around. “So who do I ask for when I want to get in touch with you?” His evasiveness brought her close to tears. “Well?” “Well what?” “Who do I ask for?” “I got fired. I haven’t been on the platform for a month.” Gillian wanted to scream: where have you been all this time? If you were out of a job, where did you stay? What have you done with my money? Is there someone else? She didn't want a confrontation and just lay silently. For the first time in their married life, they didn’t kiss each other good night. Breakfast was interrupted when the power went out. Gillian looked at her husband accusingly and said: “I suppose they’ll cut the gas off next. I don’t get paid till Friday.” “I’ll take care of it,” Brian declared. “Thank you. And how will you spend your day while I’m at work?” Brian gulped down his coffee, put on his coat and walked out. The front door slammed shut. Another first, Gillian thought, walking away without explanation. “Not good enough Brian,” she mumbled under her breath. If her husband was reluctant to explain then she had to find some answers. She opened his suitcase and went pale at the sight of bundles of cash - mint fresh banknotes. Gillian took $9,000, the money Brian had taken from her accounts, her father’s gift to him and for bills paid. She didn't want to know how much was left in the suitcase or where or how her husband had come by what looked like many thousands more. She gave in to the urge to search the suitcase for explanations and opened a large yellow envelope. A birth certificate for Brian Mountjoy, two marriage certificates in addition to her own and rates notices for two properties made her uneasy. There were three drivers’ licenses with three different names and five credit cards in different names in a worn wallet. There was also a photo album. Gillian turned to the last page and saw a woman’s smiling face, a toddler holding her hand and Brian standing besides her. There was also a bundle of letters with handwritten addresses and a few unopened invoices addressed to a post office box she knew and one she didn't. Did it matter that her husband had a past? What man didn’t? What mattered to Gillian now was the present, the future and honesty in their relationship. Gillian copied the addresses on the rates notices - just in case. She picked up the phone and thankful for dial tone, rang her office to say that she would be an hour late because of urgent family business. She took a taxi to her father’s bank and deposited $9,000 into his account. She found it difficult to concentrate on work and was quite uncertain of her next step. A confrontation now or later? The truth, a candid explanation, more secrets or walking out? The baby’s kick decided the matter. She would return home and let matters run their course. But she would tell Brian about taking the money from his suitcase-if he asked. Gillian was grateful that the power was on and prepared the evening meal as though nothing had happened. She ate alone during the 7 o’clock TV news and went to bed at 10.30. She woke briefly when she felt the mattress move, gagged at the smell of stale beer and cigarettes, hurried to the toilet and vomited. Another first, Gillian noted: a drunk husband. He was still in bed when Gillian left for work. A phone call from her father, just before leaving work, unsettled her. Brian had called on him at the bank for money to pay solicitor’s fees and conveyancing costs. When her father offered to pay the bills, Brian at his most persuasive manner, explained that it was a matter of saving face. He didn’t want someone else paying his bills. But his father-in-law refused to give him cash and Brian left empty-handed. Should she ask her husband why he needed cash from her father when there was so much cash in the suitcase, Gillian wondered. Brian had his good reasons she decided and she would not mention the phone call from her father. A nice steak, pepper gravy and a bottle of cabernet sauvignon would surely get him into a good mood. But Brian, his face red with anger, stood in the middle of the kitchen, screamed at her and blamed her father for the house and land deal falling through. Gillian feigned surprise and wanted to know more. But Brian refused to be drawn, saying only that he couldn’t be bothered building them a house now that her father had spoiled everything. “It’s not too late,” she offered. “You can still surprise me. Show me the block where you want to build. Please, darling.” But Gillian’s attempt to placate her husband had the opposite effect. He became angry, refused to reveal his plans because now he didn't have the money. “But you’ve got all this cash,” Gillian said and wished he hadn’t. But it was too late. “You’ve been snooping! You have no right to my things. How dare you? The money isn’t mine, you stupid cow,” Brian screamed, his face red and distorted with rage. He grabbed Gillian by the shoulders and when she tried to push him away, he smacked the side of her face. She didn't see a punch coming or feel the impact of her head against the edge of the sink. She was unconscious and oblivious to the kick to her abdomen and another to her side as her husband lost all self control. He slammed the front door so hard the glass broke. He returned from the pub and found Gillian lying where she had fallen. He picked her up, put her in the car and dropped her off at emergency. “She had a fall,” he explained and left. He had the decency at least to telephone Gillian’s parents. “She’s in a coma,” the doctors advised the distraught parents. “She’s had a terrible beating. There is a worrying swelling of her brain. We don’t know as yet the extent of inquiries to the foetus. We are also concerned about her right kidney.” Gillian’s mother visited her daughter at the hospital every day for ten months and while still in a coma, Gillian gave birth to a female child. Because there was no certainty that Gillian would any time soon regain consciousness, the child was placed into immediate care and adoption. When Gillian awoke from her coma, the doctors and her worried mother realised that all was not as it should be. Gillian did not know who she was and apparently, had no memory of the events that had resulted in her hospitalisation. When she had difficulty falling asleep and seldom getting a good night’s sleep, her doctor prescribed luminal tablets. She remembered getting married. The baby! “What happened to my baby?” Neither Gillian’s mother nor the hospital staff, if they had answers, revealed what happened at the hospital. Gillian moved in with her parents and over many weeks slowly recovered from her trauma. She had nightmares, difficulty sleeping and on doctor’s advice, started taking medication again. On her first outing, without realising why, Gillian drove to the flat where she and Brian had lived. She had a key in her handbag, let herself in and sat at the kitchen table. The memories flooded back. The argument with Brian. She felt her cheek and realised that on that day, she had experienced another first: physical, domestic violence and she wondered what she had done to provoke her husband into an assault. There were no dishes in the sink, the tea towel hung on the oven rail and the tea caddy still had tea. There was milk in the fridge, cheese, cream and butter. Butter? Gillian wondered. She never liked butter, never bought butter. She wandered into the bedroom where an unfamiliar dressing gown hung on the hook behind the door. The shoes on the rack were not her size. A key turning in the front door and the door shutting put an end to Gillian’s curiosity. Two women stared at each other, surprised, bewildered and at a momentary loss for words. “What are you doing in my flat?” “What are you doing in my flat?” “It’s my flat,” Gillian replied. “No, it’s not,” the other woman argued. “My husband and I live here. Get out!” “Rubbish,” Gillian asserted herself. “Brian and I live here. See, I have a key.” “Brian? My husband’s name is Brian,” the other woman replied. “Brian Mountjoy?” “No, Brian Miller. I am Julie, his wife.” “Does your husband work on an oil rig, 10 days on and 10 days off?” “How do you know that?” “Well, my Brian does. And that’s him in the photo,” Gillian said and pointed to a photo in a cheap frame. She felt too ashamed to revel to a stranger that Brian no longer worked on the oil rig. “Hang on. I have seen a photo of him and you before. With a toddler. A photo in his suitcase.” “That’s our daughter, Melissa. She’s at the crèche at the moment.” “How long have you been married to Brian?” Gillian asked. “Three years.” “And you?” “Just over a year,” Gillian replied. “But I haven’t seen him for months.” “How come?” “I have been in hospital for ten months and recovering for a few weeks,” Gillian revealed. “I think you should leave now,” The other woman said, icily. “You are going to cause trouble and we don’t need you interfering.” “I’ll leave but I’ll be back. He won’t get away with dumping me for you. He’s my husband and we had a good life together.” “Out! Get out!! I don’t want you here when Brian comes home!” the other woman yelled and went to open a drawer. “He’ll be home soon and you have to go. Leave now or else!” She menaced Gillian with a carving knife, came forward and yelled: “Piss off or else.” When Gillian refused to budge, the woman stabbed at her but Gillian was quick, seized her harm, twisted it and pushed the knife into the woman’s side. Blood gushed out when Gillian pulled the knife clear. “Help me,” the woman begged. “Stop the bleeding.” The tea towel, pressed to the side, soaked with blood, failed to stem the flow. Gillian rushed to the bathroom, returned with a towel to help the woman, now slumped on the kitchen floor. Her face was pale as she lay in a widening puddle of blood. The telephone rang and a panicked Gillian let it ring out. But soon it rang again, insistently. “Hello.” “Is that you, Mrs. Miller?” “No, her neighbour.” “Melissa is here at the crèche. Is she going to pick her up?” “Oh! I forgot, I was meant to pick her up. I can’t come right now, no way. Not for another half hour. If I pay for a cab, will you bring her home, please?” “Oh, alright. But just this once,” “Thank you. Thank you very much.” By the time the front door bell rang, Gillian had washed the kitchen floor and eliminated the blood trail from the kitchen to the bedroom where she left the lifeless woman. Gillian answered the front door, ushered the child inside and thanked the crèche manager who refused payment as she had come in her own car. Gillian’s mother was surprised to see her daughter and the little girl who happily played with Gillian’s old toys. “I’m looking after Melissa while her mum’s in hospital,” Gillian explained. “Is her mother someone from work?” her mother wondered. “Yes,” Gillian lied. “And I’ll look after the toddler. With your help.” “For a moment I thought you had kidnapped a child to…” her mother said and laughed off the thought. “Very funny, Mum,” Gillian rebuked her mum and smiled. “I have to go to back to Julie’s flat to pick up some things for her to take to the hospital. Don’t wait up for me.” Gillian turned to Melissa, smiled and cuddled the child. “Your mum won’t be long and if you’re a good girl, you can have ice- cream. Would you like that?” At the flat, Gillian ignored the dead woman in the bedroom, found Brian’s suitcase and broke the look with a screwdriver. There was no money. A loaded sawn-off shotgun, cartridges, a ski-mask, gloves and a bunch of keys startled her. Maybe it wasn’t Brian’s suitcase at all? Yes, that must be so, she decided. She had believed him when he told her that the money she had found before wasn’t his. After dark, Gillian drove her Datsun Bluebird onto the footpath, as close as she could to the front door. No one saw her dragging the dead woman to the car and lift her, with some difficulty, into the boot. She knew just where to dump the body: the Blairgowrie back beach where she dug a shallow grave with a metal hearth shovel she had found in the flat. Gillian showered, put on one of the dead woman’s nighties and dabbed on some of her perfume. Now all she had to do was wait, in bed with the lights off. Brian would be home soon, perhaps he was working late? Gillian woke when the front door slammed shut. Brian was in a good mood. She could tell from his was humming and she soon felt his weight on the mattress. Brian did just what she wanted: his hands searched under the nightie for her breast and she pushed hard against his erection. “Geez, Julie, you’re tight,” he whispered and moved rapidly against her from behind and soon spent, lay on his back and snored. He had been drinking and smoking but that was a small price to pay, Gillian decided, for the happily married life soon to be hers, again. She would have to break it to him gently in the morning: about Julie leaving him and dumping the kid. How would she know why? It was Julie who upped and left when she found out about him being married to Gillian. But the explanation would have to wait. Gillian woke at 7 o’clock and Brian had already left the flat and that was a surprise. His suitcase was beside the bed. Gillian needed to know, opened it and what she had anticipated and feared was true. She remained in the flat all morning, always within earshot of the radio, listening and hoping not to hear the news that told her what she didn’t want confirmed. “What the fuck are you doing here?” Brian yelled. His face, at first ashen when he found Gillian sitting at the kitchen table, turned an ugly red. “Where’s my wife?” Gillian could have challenged him, replying ‘I’m your wife’. But instead she gave a rehearsed explanation. “Julie’s gone. For good. She dumped you.” “So, last night?” Brian was perplexed. “Me. You made love to me,” Gillian answered. “It’s good to be home.” “This is crazy!” Brian screamed, headed for the bedroom and shut the door. When he returned, Gillian had a cup of coffee for him. “Just as you like it,” she declared. Brian sat at the kitchen table, scratched his head and lost for words, slammed his fist on the table. Gillian sat quietly, anxious not to provoke her husband. “Turn off that fucken radio.” Gillian complied then picked up her purse and a shopping list. “We’re out of fruit and vegetables and there is no meat. What do you want for tea?” “Nuthan. I won’t be in till late,” Brian replied. “Don’t wait up.” Gillian’s mother was concerned about the fretting child. She had asked no questions, even though she wanted to know where the child’s father was. Gillian, when she was ready, would explain. She was relieved when Gillian rang. “I really think you should take Melissa to see her mum. The child is very upset.” “Please tell her that I’ll pick her up soon,” Gillian replied. “Promise?” “Promise,” Gillian replied and put the phone down. “I’m on my way.” Melissa seemed happy to be home but Gillian couldn’t satisfy the child’s insistent and whining ‘I want my mummy to come home’. “Soon,” Gillian reassured the child. “She’ll be home soon and your dad will be here too.” “I don’t like him,” Melissa said. “Make him go away.” “You must not say that, Melissa! Be nice to your daddy.” “He’s not my daddy,” she complained and added: “Who are you?” “I’m Gillian. I’m looking after you while your mummy is in hospital.” “Hospital?” “Your mummy is sick. That’s why she is in hospital,” Gillian explained Brian was still asleep when Gillian took Melissa to crèche. She was a bright child who knew the way and made Gillian promise to pick her up. Melissa ran up to the crèche gate and called out, ‘Three o’clock.’ On the way back to the flat, Gillian bought steak and sausages and new potatoes with her own money, just in case Brian needed dinner. He had left $3,000 on the kitchen table, crisp new notes and unopened window face envelopes, bills for electricity, gas, telephone and another from the landlord’s agent. They were addressed to Mr. B. Miller at a local Post Office box. All the bills and also the rent, were overdue but Brian’s money was sufficient. He was a good provider, Gillian reasoned but not very capable at managing the household. Never mind, she sighed, all that was in the past for she would take care of the house and little Melissa. By the time she had paid the bills and called in at the real estate office to pay the rent and three months in advance, it was time to collect Melissa. Gillian waited at the kerb, not wanting to meet the crèche staff again. Melissa smiled and when Gillian bought her an ice cream, soon forgot about visiting her mum in hospital. Over time, Gillian imagined, Melissa would get used to Gillian as her new mum. When she was old enough to understand, Gillian would tell her about her mum abandoning her. Meanwhile, Gillian was determined to be a good substitute. She ignored the telephone and when it stopped, rang her mother who was happy to learn that all was well. When the phone rang again, Gillian unplugged it. Brian did not come home that night or the night after that. He’d be home on the weekend for sure, Gillian wished. She listened for the door and hurried to hang out the washing for she wanted to look her best, the perfect, immaculately dressed wife, ready to greet an adoring husband. It wasn’t Brian wanting to come in. He had a key. When the insistent knocking on the front door became louder and louder and when Gillian could no longer stand it, she opened the door a crack. “Yes?” “Is Julie home?” “Nobody by that name lives here,” Gillian replied. “But this is their flat,” the middle aged man insisted. “We know she lives her. We are her parents.” “I assure you,” Gillian said calmly and persuasively, “I live here on my own.” “I’m Julie’s mother. I haven’t heard from her in days. We know that Melissa still attends crèche and someone who is not Julie picks her up.” “I’m sorry, I can’t help you,” Gillian replied and closed the door. “We’ll be back,” Julie’s father threatened. Gillian took Melissa to her parent’s house and returned after dark, grilled the steak and had it with boiled potatoes. Loud banging on the front door nterrupted her peace, but she ignored the demands. “Open up. We know you’re in there. The police will be here in a minute.” “Go away!” Gillian picked up her purse, left by the back door and stood in the side drive, near the rubbish bin. The Police didn't come and when the visitors took off in their car, Gillian returned to the flat and went to bed. She awoke to loud talking in the flat. Brian came into the bedroom and whispered: “Say nothing to the Police. My name is Miller. You are my girlfriend. Leave the talking to me.” But Gillian thought it best to answer the detective who asked what she knew about the missing Julie Miller and her daughter Melissa. Gillian answered truthfully that she had lived in the flat for only five days. She had lied to Julie’s parents about Brian living in the flat because she was too embarrassed to tell strangers about living with her boyfriend. With the Police gone, Brian let fly. “They think I’m responsible for Julie’s disappearance. I’m not and I can’t afford them snooping around here. The child is still going to crèche and someone is still picking her up. Julie would never leave without the child.” “I’ve told you. She’s dumped you and I don’t know where Melissa is,” Gillian replied. “How do you know her name?” a suspicious Brian asked. “From her parents. They came to the flat yesterday,” Gillian answered, proud of her quick thinking. “Julie’s parents won’t give up. The police will find out who picked Melissa up from crèche. They’ll be back and I’ll…..” “You’ll what?” “I’ll have to come up with explanations. Something I don’t want to do. They might come back with a search warrant. They could even be watching the joint,” Brian feared. “If that is so, you’ll want to be rid of the evidence. What’s in your suitcase for instance,” Gillian said. “You would get rid of evidence for me?” “Sure. You’re my husband and with Julie out of the way, we’ll be happy. Won’t we?” “Out of the way? Why did you say out of the way?” “I didn't,” Gillian argued. “Yes, you did. Out of the way you said.” “I meant gone. Julie’s gone,” Gillian replied. “That’s what I meant.” “The suitcase. Find a safe place for it,” Brian urged. “The police won’t be watching me,” Gillian said to put Brian’s mind at rest. “You’ll be alright. And then, you’ll get yourself a regular job,” Gillian proposed. “What do you mean?” “Regular. Wages, salaries, steady hours. No more bank and TAB jobs.” “You know?” Brian asked in amazement. “And you never asked?” “I read the papers. Thankfully you never did over banks in Victoria. No one got killed. Your secret is safe with me.” “It’s not that simple. I have a partners and he…” Brian hesitated and insisted. “Go now. Go!” Two detective constables were indeed watching the flat and noted Gillian’s departure, the suitcase and the Datsun’s registration number. “What’s in the bag?” I wonder. “Nothing too heavy, by the look of it,” his colleague observed. “She won’t be going far.” Little Melissa was happy to see Gillian and Gillian’s mother was much relieved. She looked questioningly at the suitcase. “Just stuff I need to store for a while,” Gillian explained. “Mum, do you know where my tennis bag is?” “It’s in the junk room,” she replied. Gillian rummaged through years of accumulated stuff, found her tennis bag, tossed rackets and balls into a corner and went to her bedroom with it and the suitcase. She put it at the foot of her bed and stared at it. “Right”, she mumbled, “you leave me no choice.” During the twenty minute drive back to the flat, Gillian considered her next move, what Brian might say and her replies. It would all work out, she reassured herself. Brian’s crime spree would come to an end now that she knew of it. Gillian looked at the tennis bag and smiled. Just in case. The detectives, still observing the flat, noted Gillian’s arrival, the tennis bag in hand and the female child. “Is mummy home?” “Not for a few days, sweetie,” Gillian replied, picked up the child and tickled its ribs which made the child squirm in delight. “Got a lovely surprise,” Gillian teased. Melissa saw Brian asleep on the living room lounge. “I don’t like him,” she whispered. “Let’s go back to your house.” “No. This is your place. Brian will be nice to you. I promise.” “I want my mummy,” Melissa whimpered and started crying which woke Brian. He rubbed his eyes, looked at Melissa and then at Gillian. “What the fuck’s going on?” “Please don’t shout and swear in front of the child. She’s upset enough as it is,” Gillian said. “So it’s you! You’ve had Melissa all the time? You’ve been taking her to crèche?” “Yes, I had no choice. She’s been at my parents’ house on and off.” “So where is Julie?” “I told you! She’s dumped you,” Gillian insisted. “I don’t believe you. She would not leave the child behind,” Brian asserted. Banging on the front door and the call “Police” put an end to the conversation. Gillian rushed to the bedroom and tossed the tennis bag on top of the wardrobe. “You’ll have to answer the door,” Gillian said. “I’m not letting them in. Not without a search warrant,” Brian replied, walked to the front door and called out: “What do you want, copper?” “Is Melissa in the flat?” “Fuck off, copper.” “We’ll have a search warrant in half an hour. Just don’t do anything stupid.” Gillian refused to answer all questions the police put to her at the station. Brian was truthful in saying that he had nothing helpful to say. Melissa was released into her grandparents’ care. Gillian and Brian were released without charge but that was not the end of the matter, the Detective Sergeant threatened. Charges would be laid soon and the investigation would continue but for the moment, the police had nothing on which to hold them. Brian and Gillian sat in silence in a cab on the way home but Gillian knew that Brian was irate. He had just unlocked the front door when a voice behind them called out: “About bloody time.” The unexpected visitor slammed the car door of his Kingswood Station Wagon shut and came to the front door. “Go ahead inside, love,” Brian said to Gillian. “Bert and I have things to discuss.” Whatever they discussed, Gillian knew by Brian’s jaw set hard and from his frown, that it was not of benefit to her. But they surely would work things out. They were husband and wife who like any other couple had their ups and downs. But Brian shattered all her illusions. “Bert’s got a job planned. I need…” “No. Please Brian. Put an end…” “Shut up. I owe him. You would not understand. I don’t expect you to,” Brian snarled. “I am entitled to…” “No. You are not entitled to anything. I will tell you this much: I only agreed to marry you because I thought your father had money. Rich banker? Fat chance. But I found out too late. By the way I was already married then. I love Julie. I also have a wife in Lakes Entrance but we separated before I met Julie. I just can’t be bothered getting divorced. It was easier to get a new name. But you know that anyway from what’s in the suitcase. So where is my wife?” And with that, Brian grabbed Gillian by the shoulders and shook her violently. “Where is Julie? Tell me, you bitch! Where is Julie?” “Gone. She dumped you!” The smack with Brian’s open hand to the side of her face was unexpected and hard. It stung Gillian’s cheek and split her lip. “She’s gone,” Gillian replied, ran to the bathroom and locked the door. “Open the door, Gillian. Please,” Brian asked, a reasonable tone in his voice. “I’m sorry I hit you. It’s all getting on top of me, what with the police and Bert and Julie missing.” “Is that a promise?” Gillian almost begged. “Please don’t hit me?” “Promise. I promise. Just get the suitcase back,” Brian demanded. “Fine. Let’s just calm down. I’ll be out in a moment. Let’s have a coffee,” Gillian replied. “I feel like a beer.” “There is none in the house,” Gillian replied. “I’ll get some from the bottle shop,” Brian said. Gillian knew what was coming. Brian would drink a longneck and another and another till he was tanked. He would never assault her again. Never. There would be a new first in her marriage, Gillian decided. With Brian was out, she had crushed a dozen luminal tablets with the back of a teaspoon and waited until Brian had drunk two bottles. Gillian poured the crushed sleeping tablet powder into a new bottle. Brian finished that bottle too and never noticed the taste. He was soon comatose, slumped on the lounge. Gillian smacked the side of his face, gently at first. He didn’t wake and she smacked him harder. He mumbled in his drugged stupor and raised a hand in defence. Gillian sat calmly and confronted her future with a drunk for a husband, a thief, a deceiver, a bank robber, adulterer and bigamist. She smiled at thinking of her husband as a trigamist, if there was such a word. She really felt sorry for Julie and the accidental death. Soon the police would come knocking on her door. No amount of cleaning could erase traces of her blood on the kitchen and bedroom floors. Gillian stood on a kitchen chair and reached for the tennis bag on top of the wardrobe. All was ready for the suicide. The shotgun was loaded, a cartridge in each barrel. “Sorry, Brian,” Gillian whispered as she lay the weapon on Brian’s chest with the short barrel under Brian’s chin. She grasped his right hand and forced his thumb on the trigger and pulled. Nothing! She tried again with the safety catch off, closed her eyes, averted her face and pulled Brian’s thumb against the trigger. Gillian undressed in the bathroom and showered to wash Brian’s splattered blood from her face and hands. She stuffed her bloody clothes and the bath towel into the tennis bag. Gillian walked into the sitting room with eyes closed and never looked back as she gently closed the front door of the flat with all lights on. Gillian ate a meal of fish and chips in Frankston and put the empty beer bottle and the greasy paper in a rubbish bin in front of the take-away shop and dropped the tennis bag in a skip behind the supermarket. The police returned with a search warrant the day after questioning Brian and Gillian. They forced the flat’s front door when their demands to open up went unanswered. There was little of Brian’s head left. Some of his brains and skull bones were embedded in the plaster wall and blood had soaked into the lounge cushions. The detectives had little doubt about what had happened: A suicide after a bout of drinking. Forensic examiners found blood on sofa, cushions and blood splatter on the wall behind the sofa, consistent with a shotgun blast to the head. There were blood traces on the kitchen lino and blood stains in the bedroom carpet. It lent credence to the theory that Brian had murdered his wife and then, in remorse, had committed suicide. But where was Julie’s body? According to Julie’s parents, their daughter’s marriage had been a happy one. Julie had never complained about violence. Still to be determined was the identity of the woman who had picked up Melissa from the crèche. A young, nosy and eager detective decided to investigate who had taken Melissa to and from the crèche. Something, he decided, what not right. His colleagues were satisfied that Brian Miller had committed suicide after doing away with his wife. Was Gillian an accomplice? The crèche manager recalled the day, a telephone conversation with Julie’s supposed neighbour and a woman who had answered the door at the flat where Melissa lived. Now that the detective had a date for Julie Miller’s disappearance and his suspicions more aroused still, knew his next move. The Datsun’s registration number gave him Gillian’s address and armed with a search warrant, found Melissa at the home of Gillian’s parents. In the boot of Gillian’s Datsun, the police found blood stains. In the shed, police found a suitcase with its most incriminating contents, notably bank notes traced to a National Bank hold-up in Deniliquin, NSW. Before long, one Albert Denning confessed to being an accomplice. His name, address, phone number and details of his share of hold up proceeds were neatly kept in Brian Miller’s diary. The pair had robbed four banks and held up five TAB Agencies in NSW. Gillian admitted that she had placed the suitcase in the shed. She could hardly deny this as her mother had seen her with it. The crèche manager positively identified Gillian as the woman with Melissa. The blood in the Datsun’s boot was of Julie’s blood group. The police had sufficient evidence, Gillian was charged with Julie Miller’s murder and tried in the Supreme Court. Still under investigation was Brian Miller’s suicide that looked increasingly like murder with Julie as the main suspect. But because the luminal drug, found in Brian’s stomach was the only circumstantial evidence, Gillian was not charged. Gillian would not confess, pleaded not guilty to murder and took the stand. A packed court heard that on the day in question, Gillian had found a woman stranger in her flat. This woman then attacked her with a knife, Gillian defended herself and managed to escape unharmed and spent the night at her parents’ place. On returning the following day, the woman was gone and Gillian thought no more of the event. Under questioning, Gillian admitted knowing Melissa but denied abducting her. Why would she? Melissa was her daughter! An astonished prosecutor and Gillian’s barrister looked at each other. The judge made some quick notes. Gillian’s mother sobbed softly and left the court in deep despair as Gillian continued with her story. A stunned court heard that Gillian expected her husband Brian to return shortly after 10 days working on the oil platform. “He is a good provider but sometimes forgets to pay the bills. We plan to buy some wine for his cellar. Also, he will redecorate our A-frame house. He is a very good painter, you know.” The judge adjourned proceedings and called the prosecutor and defence to a conference in his chambers. He strongly advised the prosecutor and defence to reconsider Gillian’s plea or adjourn the case pending a psychological assessment. After a 10 day adjournment, the psychiatrist testified that in his opinion, Gillian Mountjoy was delusional and of unsound mind. “Is the accused putting on an act?” the judge asked. “No.” The defence barrister asked for an adjournment, which the judge granted, to confer with his client and within the hour entered a new plea of ‘Not Guilty of manslaughter due to mental impairment.’ “Does you client understand what she is pleading?” the judge asked in his chambers. “I cannot be certain, your honour,” the defence replied. The judge, after another psychiatric assessment, sentenced Gillian Mountjoy to indefinite confinement in a secure mental institution. “I want you to be certain that what you’re doing is best for you,” Mrs. Arnold said to her daughter. “You may not like what you find.” “I realize that, Mum, but I need to know about my biological parents,” Sylvia replied. “And I’ll support you, no matter what,” the mother assured her adopted daughter. Sylvia’s first move, to apply for her adoption file, was the easy step. After waiting patiently for access, Sylvia accepted well meaning advice: seek counselling as the next step in the process. The file revealed that Gillian Mountjoy nee Carrington had given birth to a daughter who was placed in the care of her adoptive parents at birth. The hospital file entry ‘… incapable of caring for the infant.’ raised questions and Sylvia was determined to find answers which were agonisingly slow in coming as she pieced together snippets of information. A digitised newspaper edition was the breakthrough she so desperately needed. Sylvia now had a thread o follow and soon read the transcript of Gillian Mountjoy’s trial. She hesitated for weeks to contact the detective for information about her father. He asked for a meeting with Gillian’s mother and the adoption counsellor before meeting Sylvia. All agreed that Sylvia finding out about the circumstances of her father’s death was premature, considering that she had not yet met her biological mother. “You have visitors, Mrs. Mountjoy,” the nurse said. “Cleopatra. I am Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile,” the inmate replied. “Please remember that, Kathryn.” “You’ve never had visitors since I’ve been here.” “Oh, I yes I have. My husband Brian will be back again soon from Bass Strait. He works 10 days on, 10 days off. I miss my mother. She died seven years ago. She always remembered my birthday. What day is it today, Kathryn?” “It’s Thursday, Cleopatra.” “I must do the vacuuming if it’s Thursday. I can’t have visitors in a dusty house. Quick Kathryn, give me a hand.” The nurse found the toy Hoover and pretended plugging it in. Gillian made the vacuum cleaner noise and ran it over the carpet in the hall, the sitting room and the kitchen/dining area. “I think I’ll do the bedrooms next week in case my daughter comes to visit,” Gillian said. “I’ll just go and show your visitors in,” the nurse said and beckoned Sylvia and her mother into the room. “This is Sylvia and her mum, Mrs. Arnold.” Gillian smiled and said: “Pleased to meet you. I don’t get many visitors now. You have a fine daughter Mrs. Arnold. I have a daughter, she is a redhead too and she’d be about your age, Sylvia.” Sylvia was at a loss for words as she stared at her real mother. Gillian was 42 years old and as Sylvia knew, had spent the last 20 years at the asylum. Gillian’s skin was pale, she had no wrinkles and shapely well manicured fingers. She wore no makeup and her hair had greyed a little. Her grey-green eyes worried Sylvia. Gillian gazed, yes, it was a gaze, not a direct look, a gaze at a point in the distance. “My husband Brian will be here soon. He works 10 days on, 10 days off on an oil platform in Bass Strait. He is a painter, you know. He will decorate our A-Frame. The bedrooms really need painting before my daughter comes. But first, we’ll go to Rutherglen for some wine. He earns good money you know. We can afford to stock a wine cellar.” “How long have you had the A-frame?” a curious Sylvia asked. “A long time. My father built it and some of the furniture too. My friends admire the house very much for its open plan design and its clever use of space. Those, who aren’t my friends, call my A- frame house The Pyramid. That is technically and geometrically incorrect. They call me Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile, mostly behind my back but I got used to it. I keep the house very tidy. I dust on Wednesday afternoons, vacuum the floor on Thursdays and wash the kitchen and laundry floor on Saturdays.” “We’d love to visit your house, wouldn’t we, Sylvia?” “Come, come,” Gillian urged and walked to the corner of the room nearest the window. “Come right in. I’ll show you the cellar too.” “But it’s…..” Sylvia said. “It’s a lovely house. So unusual for an Australian house to have a cellar,” Mrs. Arnold said. “We’ll come again when you’re not so busy.” “Good-bye, Mrs. Mountjoy,” Sylvia said. “Call me Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile.” Mother and daughter left the asylum with Sylvia in tears. “The poor woman,” Mrs. Arnold lamented. “She lives in a doll’s house.” “Only in her mind,” Sylvia added. “I guess I’ll inherit the doll’s house?” “Only if you want to be Cleopatra’s daughter.” “You know what, Mum? I think, I’ll leave asking about my father for a while,” Sylvia decided. “That, my dear, is a wise decision. He might be a pharaoh?” “No, Mum, he is a painter on an oil rig. He works 10 days on, 10 days off.” ",candidate00004
7,00002,candidate00004,"We moved house on Christmas Eve 1983 from suburban Melbourne to a small town in the Wimmera. The story starts two days later, or more precise still, on Boxing Day in the middle of the night. “Dad. Dad,” my daughter whispered, shaking me by the shoulder. “What?” “There’s a man outside my window. He talks funny.” My bedside clock showed 2.15. We had been asleep a couple of hours after unpacking all day. “I can hear him shouting from here,” I said. “What’s he doing? Come on dad!” my curious daughter urged. We felt our way along the hallway in the dark, tripping over half unpacked suitcases. “Turn the light on,” my daughter urged. “No!” We sneaked into the front room and listened to this shadowy figure that had moved on a little and now stood on the footpath right at our front door talking loudly. Then he shouted loud commands, turned and stood still. “He’s talking to the power pole,” my daughter said. “What are you two doing? Do you know what time it is?” my wife wanted to know. The dog, woken by the goings on, voiced his concern in a soft growl. “Shush, Banjo.” “Now he is talking to the wall,” I said, for the man had turned around and looked at us. “Can he see us?” “No.” Banjo went back to his basket while we three stood there in our pajamas. “Who is he?” “No idea,” I replied. “Come on sweetie,” my wife said. “Dad will keep watch, won’t you?” “Yes, Good night.” There were no streetlights, only dim light from the telephone booth across the road. Two fluorescent tubes, one on and one flickering under the Four Square Country Mart awning backlit the figure of a tall, stooped man. He wore what looked like an army great coat. He walked across the road and stood still at the supermarket door. He saluted the sandwich board leaning against the glass shop front. He seemd to be having a conversation. Trouble was, I could only see one person, but heard two voices. One spoke with authority, loudly, distinctly and fluently. The other spoke softly and more slowly, indistinctly and diffidently. Then, at the top of his lungs, he commanded a turn, did so and marched on the spot: “LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LE-HEFT….” “HALT!”The coat sleeves were much too short for his skinny arms, now at his side. “AT EASE!” Then he gave someone a real dressing down. Banjo started barking as did the bitser next door and farm dogs up in the hills. A window in the flat above the shop opened. “Go home John,” a voice called out. ” For God’s sake.” John stumbled across the road, looking neither right nor left and walked past our house. He stopped at our door again and started talking just as the clouds parted and moonlight broke through. His lips moved but he didn’t speak. His head nodded up and down and from side to side. He had something to say but the severe stammer, mumblings and incoherent mutterings told me nothing that made sense. “LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LE-HEFT….” he shouted and marched. His voice faded but not before he had set off more dogs barking. I went back to bed. He must have retired too for everything went quiet. It was the day after Boxing Day and the shop was open. I knew straight away that this was John. There was the army coat draped over a chair next to him. He was sitting at a kitchen table just inside the shop drinking coffee, a regular thing as I learnt. I introduced myself to the woman behind the counter. She had Rhonda embroidered on her apron. She came from behind the counter and asked John: “Do you want to do your shopping today?” He thought very hard and took forever to make up his mind. ”Ye..ye..ye.. yes.” “Show me the list, please.” Rhonda, obviously used to his fumbling and muttering waited patiently. “Is it in the sweatband?” John smiled and reached for the hat beside him on the tiled floor. “F…fff…fff… found it.” He looked very pleased and started talking to himself. “Did Big John keep you awake last night?” Rhonda asked as I paid for my milk. “For a little while,” I admitted. “Does he do this a lot, this late night raving?” “Not as often now. Two, three times a week. He is not drunk, only a bit unhinged. Just tell him to go home. I do.” Unhinged. Rhonda’s polite assessment got me wondering. Big John still sat there, having an argument with someone inside him. He seemed to be well known and tolerated for many coming into the shop greeted him, but no-one made an effort to speak to him, other than ‘Hello, how are you?’ to which his reply was invariably: “G….g….g…g… good, thanks.” Over coming months, I realized that if you engaged him in conversation, you had to get used to him looking past you with eyes staring at something over your right shoulder. He was Big John but not really big any more-just tall. Why Big John? I never found out. He was well over six foot tall even allowing for the pronounced stoop. Age? Seventies, maybe 80? He was bone, skin and sinew. His arms were thin sticks, his hands huge with bony knuckles, dark with darker age spots, some grayish and flaking. He wore hob nail boots without laces. He picked up his battered squatter hat. It was brown, green, grey perhaps-definitely a sunbleached hat colour. A small crown with a triangular tear, a brim not too wide. There was a greasy stain in the front where fingers over the years had picked it up and adjusted the angle. A hat some might put on a scarecrow or keep on a nail in the shed for no reason at all. He stood up, swayed a little and lurched towards the exit. His navy twill pants were a hand width too short and his bony ankles showed. He didn't bother with socks. He stood in the door way and started talking to the doorframe. “See you John,” Rhonda called out, “Be home by three for your groceries.” That interrupted his monologue and he shuffled off, head well forward, terribly unsteady. His boots made his shuffling gait, a staggering wobbly walk, a noisy affair. You could hear him scraping on the paved footpath from quite a distance-especially at night. His house was seven houses down from ours. The front garden needed weeding and the wire gate was half open and jammed permanently because of the broken top hinge. The verandah looked decidedly rickety, with gaps in the decking. The weatherboards looked patchy where some helper had failed to match the original colour. It might have been the geraniums or the magnificent magnolia tree in flower that gave this otherwise neglected and worn place a happy and welcoming look. John got by with a little bit of help. A district nurse came by three times a week. Meals on wheels delivered. John lived there on his now. His parents had lived there and he settled down with his widowed mother two years after the war ended, over as far as he was concerned already in 1943. He did not know what happened to him from the artillery battle in 1943 until 1947 when he came home. So John told Mick and Mick told me. John liked Mick and trusted him with money. Come pension day, Mick, who was the Postmaster and Commonwealth Bank agent, put a set amount into John’s special savings account. When there was enough in the kitty, John and Mick would go and see a travel agent. When he really wanted to, John was quite capable and decidedly independent. He stood in the main street, walking on the spot and looked this way and that. He wore a suit and tie and had a new walking stick. There was a worn leather suitcase close by his side. “You going somewhere John?” “Ja….Ja…. Ja… Ja Japan.” “Japan. Wow!“ He had the wickedest look about him and his eyes sparkled. “You’re up to no good,” I declared. His face broke into an even broader smile and I swear, he blushed and sniggered! “Gonna see me girlfriend,” he said. “In Os…Os…Os … Osaka.” “You dirty dog,“ I said and that made him laugh. ”Gonna have a ma… ma… .ma… ma… . massage!” “Ashiatsu?” I guessed and he nodded. “She walks all over your back?” “Yes. I like that.” Mick drove him to the airport. I wondered what the Japanese would make of this giant, thin geriatric with the warmest grin, wide mouth and big square teeth. Mick came by our house later and we talked about John. Had he done the right thing letting him go to Japan on his own? He had been there before. John’s next trip would be a four week Mediterranean cruise. The doctor insisted: John needed a companion and Mick obliged. Why the Mediterranean? Mick told me: John had served in North Africa as a gunner in World War II. His artillery crew had taken a direct hit from the enemy position after four days of exchange fire. Only John survived, slightly wounded in body. The barrage and deaths had sent him over the edge. The doctors diagnosed battle fatigue and declared him medically unfit. After three years in mental hospitals, the doctors could do no more for this traumatized man. In their opinion, John would dwell most of the time in his inner world. Not a dangerous schizophrenic but a man who able to function adequately in the outer world. He would suffer flashbacks for as long as he lived. He would be unpredictable but not a danger to himself or others. Unhinged. Mick explained that the Big John we knew, was the same man who, discharged from hospital, had come to live with his widowed mother. John had made good his promise to her, to come home. Perhaps that promise had brought him out of a catatonic state? Yes, he was home in body. His troubled mind was elsewhere. The villagers understood and made allowances. I don’t know whether we got used to John’s midnight excursions or whether he stayed home nights. Dog sometimes let out a soft “woof”. “Good boy Banjo. It’s only John. Go back to sleep.” To which he replied “humph” as if to say, ‘fine with me’. He was that sort of dog. The tourist pair came back early by air from Rome. John had fallen ill half way through the cruise. I used to see him at the Post Office quite regularly, but not lately. I asked Mick what John was up to. He had fallen at home. The broken hip mended ever so slowly. A hunched figure hobbled up the road, bent over a Zimmer frame, arms at an uncomfortable and awkward angle. It was Big John-or what was left of him. It was agony watching him lift the appliance, move it forward a fraction and catch up with faltering steps. He talked to the ground, angry. He had enough sense not to cross the road alone. I helped him until he was safely in the supermarket car park. “How are you John?” Rhonda asked. “A bit s…s….s…..slow.” She held the heavy shop door open for him and got a big smile. He managed the single step up-but only just. His face was gaunt and grey. There was caked, white spittle in the corner of his mouth. He had not shaved for quite a while. Nobody had cleaned his ears of long hairs. His fingernails were too long. He started mumbling to himself as soon as he sat down. His two voices started arguing, about what was impossible to say and kept interrupting each other. Some out-of-towners looked away, embarrassed and uncertain of what was going on. The locals just shrugged their shoulders; we knew. Rhonda brought him his coffee and that interrupted the ravings. He returned to our real world but briefly. By the time he was out the door, he had sunk back into a world of stress, conflict, turmoil oblivious of his surroundings. I don’t know what happened to Big John after Anzac Day 1997. He was there without the Zimmer frame and stood at attention as close as he could to the Cenotaph, just a stone’s throw from our house. Someone had spruced him up-he looked proud and capable. He stood tall, quite straight, medals and all. He touched the cold marble and traced the name of fallen comrades. His eyes watered. His lips moved but no words came out. But then: “ATTEN SHUN.” “LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LE-HEFT….” His voice boomed stronger than ever. His commands and the bugle call started Banjo barking in the backyard. I didn’t see Big John after that. What is it they say about old soldiers?",candidate00004
8,00001,candidate00005,"So, I'm standing in this crop circle, down in Wiltshire, England, and there's a girl dangling a crystal from the end of a chain. She's very pretty, so I'm thinking I'll have to find a way of overlooking the fact she's probably also some kind of crank if I want to take advantage of the situation here. I mean, it's not every day someone as good looking stops what she's doing, looks up, and smiles at me this way: ""First time?"" she asks. She's talking about the circle, I suppose, so I tell her yes, though this isn't actually true. There was another circle, long ago, but it's complicated and pointless explaining all of this now, so instead I go: ""Wow, that's a lovely crystal!"" which isn't as obviously flirty as complimenting her on her eyes or her hair or her dress or something, is it? Anyway: ""Thanks,"" she tells me. ""But it's just a lump of quartz - you wanna try it?"" And I say: ""Erm,… no,… it's okay."" ""Don't believe in that sort of thing then?"" Her eyes are green, and her hair is long and blonde and all frizzed up, and she's so sweet and charming I can already feel myself blushing at the effect she's having on me. ""I didn't want to disturb you, that's all,"" I tell her. ""I mean, you looked so absorbed."" ""Well, I'm done now."" I look around at the circle - though strictly speaking it's not just a circle. Sure, there's a main central circle of flattened crop, and we're standing in that, but there are also four smaller out-riding circles and, altogether, they're placed like the five dots on a dice. Then there looks to be a square, making tangents to all five circles, which ought to be quite something, I suppose - I mean really difficult to draw - except the lines don't quite meet, and the corners of the square have all been botched. It all looked so much better from up on the road and that's what tempted me down. I can't say what I was expecting to feel here, I mean standing in a circle again after all these years, only that what I'm feeling now isn't it. ""So, is it real, do you think?"" I ask. She laughs. ""Nope."" ""Does your crystal tell you that?"" ""My eyes tell me that, silly. They tell me pretty much who dunnit too."" ""Oh?"" ""Be that crew from Abbotsford way. Total menace if you ask me. They're givin' all the other corn crushers a bad name this season."" ""What are you dowsing for then, if you know it's a fake?"" She gives me a twinkle. ""Answer to a question maybe - like should I be worried about this guy who's been follerin' me round this past half hour?"" ""Ah,… "" I take a step back and raise my hands. Unarmed, see? Harmless,… that's me. Okay, I've been a little careless but a guy can sometimes reach the point when he begins to feel invisible to pretty girls, so he takes it for granted he can look at them all day long and they won't see him. Okay, that's a lame excuse, I know, and I've got some apologising to do, so I say: ""Sorry,… I didn't mean to frighten you."" ""Its okay,” she replies. “Crystal says there's no harm in you."" ""Really, I am sorry. It was just that it seemed a creepy place and I felt better, being in sight of someone else. Sounds soft I know,… "" She looks at me with one suspicious eyebrow raised. ""Crystal says the truth's a little shaky on that one."" ""But you didn't consult the crystal. I thought you kind of waved it about to get an answer."" ""Sometimes I don't need to."" I'm thinking I've blown it, but then she smiles and it seems I might have got away with it, but now I'm looking at her and realising how young she is. Twenty one? Twenty two? Far too young for someone like me, fast sliding into his middle age. It's time to be making an exit then, but it seems I've aroused her curiosity now and she's not ready to let me go just yet. ""Never been in a circle that feels creepy,"" she tells me. ""Some people jump at shadows, but that's a fear inside of them. If this place spooks you, it's in your head."" There's more to this girl than her looks! There's also, dare I say, a sympathy about her? And it's this sympathy that finally tempts out my confession: ""Actually,"" I tell her. ""I have been in a circle - once before."" ""Oh?"" ""Twenty years ago. Something happened. It shook me up a bit. That's why I'm nervous about being in this one."" She reaches out and takes my arm - sort of cups the elbow in her palm and just holds it quietly. A moment ago, all I wanted to do was make out with her but now she's comforting me against a fear she can only guess at, and I'm letting her do it because I sense something in her touch. Call it an intuition, or a delusion, but I feel this girl knows something, and that she can help me. ""Haven't been in one since?"" she asks. ""Nope."" ""Weren't that many circles around back then,"" she muses. ""Easier to fall into a live one I suppose. Is that what you're looking for maybe? A live one?"" ""Is there such a thing? I thought they were all,.. well,… "" ""Fake?"" She smiles knowingly. ""I can feel you trembling. You're telling me a circle scared you so much - and then ask me if they're all fakes?"" ""But it might just have been something in my head, like you said."" ""Well, you won't ever know until you step into a live one again. But nowadays it's complicated. Sure, you're right: there are so many people faking them now it's hard to know what you're lookin' at."" She smiles. ""Unless its that Abbotsford crew who's done it of course."" We laugh, then she tells me her name is Jocynda, and she asks me if I'd like her to show me a real one, a live one, as she calls them. But I'm thinking it'll be going dark soon, and I'd rather not be wandering around a crop circle in the dark, because it was dark the last time, and I'm not ready to get that close to things just yet. ""Is it far?"" ""Won't be."" ""I don't understand."" ""It'll be near here, yes, but it hasn't happened yet. I'm expecting a fresh one any day. I know exactly where it's gonna be: Crystal tells me that - already dowsed it off a map, see?"" ""Ah,… and you can't tell me where, I suppose?"" ""Nope. Secret. If I let it slip, the corn crushers might find out and go and make a circle in its place. And that's no use to anyone, is it?"" This is beginning to sound like the fantasy of a child. Have I misjudged her? Is she just a crank after all? ""I'll just have to trust to luck then,"" I tell her. She senses my patronising tone but forgives it with a sigh. ""Even the freshest circle hereabouts is a few weeks old,"" she explains. ""The few live ones have all settled down to background ripples by now. They'll be no use to you. I'll gladly tell you where they are but, trust me, you need a fresh one, no more than a day old."" ""You've no idea when it's going happen?"" ""Soon."" ""Crystal tells you that too?"" She giggles. ""You don't believe any of this, so whatever I say's no better 'n a guess to you is it?"" She's got me there. ""What's the hurry anyway?"" she asks. ""Never said there was. I just don't want to visit one at night, that's all."" ""Scaredy cat."" She smiles. ""Why not come to the pub and meet my friends then? Crystal says you're sad and it'll cheer you up. They have rooms there. Stay the night, see what the morning brings?"" Of course, I do not want to go to the pub, and meet Jocynda's friends. What I want is to sit at a quiet table, just her and me. I want a monopoly on her warmth and her smiles. I want to pretend I'm twenty years younger, then I can savour the glorious ambiguity of this invitation. I know she's just being friendly, but a man can dream. Anyway, instead here I am, in a cramped bar-room that's hot and loud with the sound of beery faced people. Everyone seems to be laughing like loons, except for my companions, a pair of po faced young men who sense I do not want to be there, and reciprocate with an impressive sullenness. We're hunched around a small, wobbly table, shoulder to shoulder, clutching glasses of a dark and pungently yeasty ale. I have not seen Jocynda for a while and am beginning to feel I've been abandoned to the mercies of these, my indifferent companions. One of them is called Callum. He's a dark haired, lanky youth, who was quick to ascertain my position on the flying saucer and green men hypothesis, with its attendant conspiracies of a sinister government cover-up. Significantly, he's offered no attempts at more varied conversation since then, upon discovering I do not share his beliefs. The second young man calls himself Wombat. He's a blonde, baggy jumpered, dread-locked dreamer of sorts, for whom the photographs of many seasons' worth of crop formations, framed above the bar, seem a constant source of inspiration for him, at least judging by the way his eyes divide their time between these holy icons, and the rim of his glass. One of the pictures is indeed of a pseudo-religious mandala, pressed into a golden crop of wheat. I remember it from a few years back, when it was outed in the national press as a fake, made for a documentary on the abiding credulity of human beings. When I mention this, Wombat tells me the fakers are responding to unconscious energies that guide their creations - so there is no such thing as a fake formation anyway. Indeed he goes further and tells me I am a victim of decades worth of government disinformation, and that my ignorance of these matters is proof alone of that fact. There is no answer - all his bases are covered, his position is unassailable. With the exception of their conspiracy theories, which bear certain similarities, the views of these young men seem quite different, and I am wondering how they can be so politely reconciled for them to keep such company together, but then their eyes are caught by Jocynda as she returns, and their expressions say it all. It's really quite simple, of course: they are young, and horny, and hopeful! There is another young man in tow - Dervish, she calls him. He's smartly jacketed, bespectacled, and intelligent looking, and there's something more urbane about him than these two country lads. He nods to me, then buys a round. I offer Jocynda my seat and squeeze through the crowds to join him at the bar. Dervish, I discover, is a self-confessed circle faker, the leader of a group of corn crushers currently locked in a battle of one-upmanship with a fiendishly proficient crew from Warminster. He points out the picture of a fractal star from last year's season, pressed into a barely-field and claims it as his own work - then grudgingly concedes the picture of another, an intricately worked Celtic motif, as being the handiwork of the Warminster lot. ""So, what do these guys think of you, then?"" I ask, nodding to where Callum and Wombat are currently falling over themselves to entertain Jocynda. ""I mean, them being such believers?"" He shrugs and smiles, as if he thinks the question is crass. He seems to be telling me I'm an outsider here and I just don't get the vibe. ""We're all part of the same scene, man,"" he says. We return with drinks, in time to hear the lads embarking on their discourses: Callum with news of a space-ship and attendant strange beings, spotted by the White Horse at Uffington. Then Wombat gives us an intricate post-hoc analysis of the errors in the Cantor Set formation discovered in a meadow by Stonehenge, and how they're not errors at all but a cleverly coded message that clearly predicts the date of the next apocalypse. He's a bit too young to remember, I suppose, but they were saying similar things about 2012. Meanwhile, Dervish listens to it all with polite interest, hoovering up their thoughts and perhaps wondering how he can incorporate features into his creations that will reinforce these various beliefs. Then the others want to know from him what he's planning next. I swear he gives a twinkle from his suddenly rascally and theatrically revealed gold tooth, and then he says it will be big - more complex even than the Sumerian motifs of last season, that they should prepare themselves to be blown away! They stare at him agape, as if they see him as a sort of messianic instrument, and I notice he is careful to say nothing that might discourage them in these beliefs. Me? Well, I'm older aren't I? I am of an age when I see beliefs as no different to all the other useless jabberings in this bar. In another twenty years, these guys will be looking back and believing in nothing much at all, and I'm guessing, like me, the only thing they'll really remember about tonight in any detail is Jocynda - the colour of her eyes, the texture of her hair, what she was wearing, and how much she filled our hearts with such sweet longing. They're laughing now. Jocynda has told them about the Abbotsford crew's latest efforts, and they are amused by how I could ever have been taken in by it. So I remind them that by their own arguments, the fakers respond to unconscious influences of a paranormal nature - therefore how can the Abbotsford crew be any different? But the lads are united in their belief the Abbotsford crew aren't a real part of the phenomenon at all - just a bunch of cider-swigging yokels. It seems one must possess a certain level of social gravitas in order to become a true instrument of the gods. They close their ranks and look at me as if wondering what Jocynda means by dragging this grumpy old guy into their presence. It's clearly not to make them jealous - so then what? I suppose Jocynda means nothing by it all except showing kindness to a stranger. Seeing her with them though makes me wonder again what I thought I was doing, letting myself be seduced into hanging around like this. I realise of course I don't really see Jocynda when I look at her - only her beauty, and such beauty is ageless. It pays no heed to the stages of a man's life. Sure: when he's younger, he can make love to it - but when he's older? What's he supposed to do about it then? By now the beer has taken my legs, made me sweaty and dizzy, and I'm incapable of working any of this out. The noise of the bar is like a wall of madness ringing in my ears and I want to go, except now she's lowered her mouth to my ear and is saying: ""Tell us about your circle."" ""My what?"" The jabbering in the bar is so loud I do not hear my own words, so I am shouting above it, and the others look surprised because it seems they hear me very well. ""Sorry,"" I tell her. ""Getting a bit tired."" She's disappointed, but her sparkle is quickly restored by the continuing attentions of her companions who seem far more eager for her company than they do for mine. I make my excuses, then slip away to my room, quietly grizzling as I climb the stairs: I might have been lying in my own bed by now, far away from the past, from my youth, but instead, I've descended into a kind of cesspit, seething with human madness - a madness that is totally incapable of answering the question first posed to me in a simple swirled circle of wheat all those years ago: How does one judge the truth of anything? In the morning, I am on the carpark of the inn, rested, breakfasted and lifting my bags into the boot. I've decided it's best to head for home but, right on cue, an old Volkswagen bug appears, and Jocynda trails a lazy arm from its window, as she rolls up beside me. She slides her shades down a touch and says: ""You going?"" ""Yep."" ""Crystal says you're angry - that we got on your nerves last night."" ""Crystal's wrong, then. I mean,… I was angry - but not with you,… or your friends. Like you said it's something in my head. That's why I was angry, and that's why I should be going."" ""You are angry, though."" She's looking so pretty this morning, all hugged up in a sweater against the cool air. But the sky is clear and it'll make a fine day when the sun gets up - a day for lingering, for admiring the beauty of this lovely creature. But what's the use? That's not why I came here at all! ""I can't solve any of this now,"" I tell her. ""It's just too damned late for me."" ""Are you going to explain that, or shall I see what Crystal says?"" She's smiling, giving me the impression she sees more in me than I'm comfortable with. Is it so obvious I'm jealous of her boyfriends, jealous of their youth, and angry too that youth can be so blind to beauty, all it wants to do is hump its bones? ""It's just that nothing I heard last night explains anything,"" I tell her. ""Oh?” ""I came looking for a solution."" ""To what? The circles?"" ""Maybe, but it's more than that. The circles just bring it all into sharper focus, that's all. I came looking for the truth: I mean about everything!"" ""Is that all?” She gives a dry laugh. “I take it you've had no luck yet?"" ""Can it really be so difficult? The circles I mean. On the one hand I'm offered Callum and his scary little green men, while on the other I get Wombat and his mother earth going on about yet another damned apocalypse - as if we didn't have enough paranoia the last time. Then there's Dervish and his cynicism about the other two lads believing in all this paranormal stuff, while so far as I can tell his only motive's a rather shallow and egotistical desire to have the Warminster corn crushers fall down and worship at his feet."" She thinks back fondly, then chuckles. ""Yep. That just about covers it. You'd think one of them would be right, wouldn't you?"" ""But what about you? What do you think?"" ""Me? Oh,… "" she shakes her head and looks clueless. ""Wotcher asking me for, silly?"" ""You talked about ripples, about circles quietening down after a while. You dowse for energies with your crystal. I mean what's that all about?"" ""I don't dowse the circles. Crystal tells me things, that's all. Circles tingle, lots of people feel that - don't need to measure it. Energy? Whatever does that mean? All I know is a tingly circle's where it happens for me. Think its where it happened for you too. And where it might happen for you again."" ""Where what might happen?"" ""Listen, maybe you're not going to get this, but if it's the truth you're after, then you need to find a tingly circle and step into it. Then you'll know."" ""Why can't you just tell me?"" ""Because it wouldn't make any sense to you, silly."" ""Try me."" ""Okay imagine this: a place where anything you believe in can be. Anything at all! Green men come to stick things up your bum? Great Mother nagging us about yet another bloody apocalypse? Dervish's rational world where nothing ever happens that he can't calculate? All of it. All true, at the same time. See? No problem."" ""You're right. It doesn't make any sense at all."" She bites her lip - impatient with herself that she cannot explain things any better. Then she leans across and clicks open the passenger door. ""Get in. I want to show you something."" She takes me out across the downs, the old bug thrumming away and smelling of damp carpets. She does not speak, but rides quietly with the window down, her hair blowing in the draft, the crystal nestling snug in her bosom and shooting out little rainbows as the sun hits it. We pull over down a quiet lane, the trees in a nearby copse swishing in the breeze, a meadow of pale green barley moving in liquid silver waves, and there's a whole set of concentric circles, like a bullseye in its middle. The formation looks freshly minted and I'm wondering if it's the one that Crystal predicted, but she hastens to reassure me it's not - says it's a few weeks old now and fairly quiet but a live one all the same. She picks up on my hesitation and tells me not to worry, that nothing dramatic will happen here, that I can relax - merely dip my toes a little. So I follow her through the wire, pick up a tram-line, and she leads me out to the formation. As she enters, she raises her arms, with her palms flat, and gives a little twirl. ""Tingle's nearly gone now,"" she says. ""But you might feel it, if you're quiet."" There is a tingle in my palms, but that could be anything. Less easy to explain is the buzzy, crackly sound in my ears, but that could just be too many rock concerts. There's a different look to this one though: a puzzling complexity to the way the barley's swirling, first one way, and then the next. It's strange,… beautiful. ""Not the work of the Abbotsford crew then?"" She laughs, tells me I'm a fast learner, coaxes me into the centre of the circle, then asks me to hold still. Then she plants her index finger in the middle of my forehead: ""Know what's inside of there, under my finger?"" ""Brain?"" ""Which bit of brain, silly?"" ""Erm,… front bit?"" ""Okay, now go deeper. Imagine my finger poking deep inside, as far as it can go."" ""Middle bit, then?"" ""Pineal gland. Okay? Called that 'cos it's like a pine-cone? Geddit?"" ""Okay, I've heard of it."" ""Feel my finger tickle it now? Likes to be tickled. Tickle it by twiddling some magnets around your head and strange things will happen.” ""Oh?"" ""Hallucination maybe - or maybe something else. Some call it a port-way to whatever ocean floats your boat."" ""You're saying a tingly circle will induce an hallucination?"" ""I said maybe."" She lowers her finger and looks around. ""Why not? If it's magnetic - and it vibrates. Sounds right, feels right to me."" ""A magnetic anomaly? Okay! That gives the energy a name. But why would it fade? And why would it vibrate? And how does it get here. None of these are answers, Jocynda - just more questions."" She offers no explanation but looks closely at me again: ""Tell me now,"" she says. ""What happened to you?"" I'm feeling more than just a tingle in my palms at the moment and I'm not sure I want to explore this. I'm still nervous about it, I guess, because the hairs are standing on my arms, and I can feel ants crawling over the top of my head. ""I don't know what happened, but it didn't feel like an hallucination."" ""Grrrr. Can't you just tell me?"" ""Okay, a bunch of us dared each other to sleep out in a circle, near Avebury, one summer. I was a pretty rational kind of guy in those days, and I didn't think anything about it, but I woke up in the small hours to find the others had gone, and there was this big cardboard box in the middle of the circle with my name on it - not scribbled mind - it was printed into the cardboard, all official-like. So, I figured the others were having me on, except I couldn't work out why they'd left me, or why they'd gone to the expense of making up a personalised box. ""It seemed too elaborate, nonsensical, like things are in dreams, but at the same time it felt so real. I shouted for them, thinking they were hiding out in the field, but after a while I knew I was alone. Then a voice came from inside my head, a woman's voice - clear, gentle - not frightening or anything - and she told me that if I looked inside that box I'd find the answer to everything I'd ever wanted to know - that I would find the truth, you see?"" ""Cool. So, what did you do?"" ""Do? What do you think I did? I ran. I went back to the van, but the others weren't there. They turned up in the morning, said they'd slept the whole night through, in the circle, like we'd agreed, and woke up to find me gone."" She flops down in the barley, and I flop down with her. The crop's beginning to lift itself back up to the sun and the little brush-like stalks tickle us as we lay there. ""You wish you'd looked inside that box, don't you?"" ""Knowing for sure I'd really seen that box would be a start."" She gives me a sympathetic look, and then floors me with the most peculiar question: ""Do you believe in unicorns?"" ""Erm,… you want the honest answer?"" ""Okay,… fair do's. But I've believed in them since I was a little girl - or maybe wanted to believe, is a better way of putting it."" ""Go on."" ""Saw one in a crop circle,"" she tells me. ""That makes my cardboard box seem dull. Do you see them often?"" ""Don't look at me like that! Just tell yourself it's an hallucination and you'll be okay with it. Anyway, there I am, in the middle of the day - other people all around me and I'm wondering why they can't see him too."" ""What's he like, your unicorn?"" ""Oh, he's such a beauty. Soft to touch, coat like silk. He's very shy, but he lets me pet him. Been seeing him for years now - in places like this. I haven't ridden him yet, but I'm working up to that. Now, I know what you're thinking, and I've thought the same thing, but what if he really is a unicorn?"" ""The way you describe him, I wish he was real. But there's got to be a difference between what the mind invents, and what's true. Where would we be otherwise? There'd be no consistency to the world."" ""Have you never thought that maybe we don't need consistency? Maybe we only think we do. Maybe in a pure state of being, consistency is something we only play with now and then, and what's really true is something so far beyond our understanding we can never hope to touch it while we're livin' in these skins. The truth we crave is just the petty stuff, the stuff we let ourselves believe in. We narrow our beliefs to something small, and that's the measure of our world, our truth. Ask me, I think your box was empty. That's what your voice was trying to tell you."" ""Lucky I didn't open it then, or I'd've been really cross."" ""Ha ha."" ""Listen, you're starting to sound like Callum and Wombat now. Take some advice? If you really want Dervish to like you, you must play down this side of yourself. I mean, this unicorn thing is really cute, but,… well,… I don't see him going for it."" She's amused. ""What makes you think I want Dervish to like me that way?"" ""Just guessing. I don't have Crystal to help me out all the time."" ""Well, I'm not that fussed about Dervish really. But out of interest, if you were me, who would you choose?"" ""Among those three reprobates? Well, Dervish is the better looking, but he's a bit of a rake, and he only wants one thing from you."" ""Crystal agrees."" she says. ""And Callum?"" ""Callum doesn't trust anyone - he thinks the whole world's in conspiracy against his version of the truth, so one day he's going to wind up wondering what it is you're hiding as well, and it won't matter how you play it, he'll always have an answer for why his creepy version of reality's more valid than your sunny one, where unicorns gallop across the Wiltshire downs. As for Wombat - well, he's a sweet guy but he doesn't look the kind to hold down a regular nine-to-five for the rest of his life, which is what you need a damned sight more than woolly words when you've got kids to bring up."" ""Sounds like none of them will do then. Perhaps you're thinking I should pick you instead?"" She pouts wonderfully, but she's only playing with me. ""Well, I've been smitten since I first saw you, Jocynda, but I don't think that's what this is about, do you?"" She sighs. ""Crystal agrees."" ""It does?"" For a moment I'm gutted, until I remember it's only what the crystal says, and I don't believe in it - except it must be what Jocynda thinks or she wouldn't believe in it either. ""Crystal's not so dumb then,"" I tell her. She takes my hand. Okay - she knows I'm not going to get the wrong idea now, but she needn't test me so. ”What is it about, then?"" she asks. ""For me? What it's always been: seeking that box with the truth in it, but always getting waylaid by beauty."" I'm looking right at her as I tell her this and manage to leave her in no doubt about the kind of beauty I'm meaning. She blushes and shakes her head. ""You're very kind, but one day I'll be old and all of this will have gone. Beauty is so fleeting. And the truth? Well, like I said, that's whatever you choose to make it. Both are human values, and chasing either's gonna,… well,… "" she chuckles. ""Have you runnin' round in circles."" I've stretched out on my back and cupped my hands behind my head. The barley's soft and springy underneath and I'm feeling pretty good, just being with her. Meanwhile she's moved around a little and she's laying down on her back too, resting her head upon my belly like it's a pillow, the two of us making a big T in the middle of the circle. Then something pops into my head and I'm saying: ""This isn't an old circle at all is it?"" ""Nope. Came down last night, right where crystal said it would. Feels like a real live one to me. Relax. No saying what might happen.” I stiffen at once. ""You could have warned me!"" ""Shush now, relaaaax! Just to fall into it – real gentle like."" ""Okay,… but I hope it's not little green men. Ughh. Nasty things."" She laughs. ""How could it be? You don't believe in them."" ""I know, but listening to Callum can be scary - and fear is infectious, isn't it? What if he's contaminated me with his own beliefs. I mean, what if he's right?"" ""He is right. Remember? Leastwise in his own head he is. Just like the rest of us."" She chuckles. ""Now, don't you go worrying about any little green bogey men. I'll just shoo them away with my unicorn, while you go lookin' for your box."" I can hear that buzzing sound again, and while I'm feeling kind of dizzy, I'm also feeling sleepy and comfortable. Meanwhile, Jocynda's found my hand once more and she's holding onto it, because I think she feels it too. So,… I'm now about three hours Northbound, and the M5 is about to join the M6, so the traffic's starting to get a bit sticky, like it always does around here. It's late evening, the sun going down and there are little rainbows shooting out of the crystal that's dangling from my rear view mirror. Jocynda told me it was just a lump of quartz and not to make such a fuss when she gave it to me. I needn't believe in it, she said, that it was really just something to remember her by. Then she kissed me, sort of shy, and then she waved me off. I found my cardboard box, right where I'd left it twenty years ago, and it was empty, just like Jocynda guessed it would be. Now, maybe it was only empty because she put the thought into my head, but it's not the first time I've wondered about it. After all, what can you put inside a box that's vague enough to be read as a metaphor describing the truth of all things, in any language, yet still make any kind of any sense to you? Let's just say it came as no surprise, even though I've spent the best years of my life hoping there might have been something more, I don't know,.. tangible, I suppose. What am I supposed to make of it then? Well, maybe Dervish and his hoaxers had somehow worked their way inside my head, given my pineal thingy a playful kick, and were having a darned good laugh at my expense, but I looked up from my empty box to find Jocynda, dressed in white, like a picture book fairy, sitting proudly on the back of her unicorn and I was left wondering if she might actually be right about a lot of other stuff as well. Suddenly the quest for truth, in human terms at least, seems overrated to me now. Ask anyone what those circles down in Wiltshire are about or how they got there, and you'll get a different answer every time. It's really no more than whatever you choose to believe it is. And if that's so, I'd rather have Jocynda's sunny wishful thinking than some of the other creepy stuff I've heard. Anyway, going back to Jocynda sitting on that unicorn, she gave me a twinkle, then she and that magnificent beast just took off over the downs in a scene as lovely as anything I'm ever going to bear witness to again. And, unlikely as it might have appeared to common sense, I could not deny the heart-wrenching beauty of it. Okay: red tail lights are stabbing up ahead now as the motorway slows down, so I close in behind the car in front and give the crystal a tap, then watch it swing. Sure, Jocynda will grow old like me and some of what she has will fade. But real beauty's not like she said: it's only when we try to pin it down it becomes ephemeral. Think of it more as a feeling though, like how the sight of Jocynda on that fantastic beast lifted my heart to the heavens, then beauty becomes something altogether different. Such a thing can transport you to the edge of infinity, to a place no amount of petty truth is ever going to describe. Oh, I know: I told her I was searching for the truth, like a shining knight of old, but always getting waylaid by beauty. Well, if you ask me now, I've always had it the wrong way round. So, go seek the eternal beauty of the soul, my friend, and don't go getting yourself waylaid by promises of truth, no matter how alluring, because it's always going to be an illusion, or just somebody else's nightmare, or at the very best a closed down vision of a world that could be whole lot bigger, if we could only open our eyes a little wider.The traffic's really bad now! I could do with some directions on how to get around it. Sat Nav? What kind of truth will that give me? A narrowly plotted path from one place to the next? Sounds dull! I reckon from now on, I'll just go,… … .by whatever Crystal says. ",candidate00005
9,00002,candidate00005,"Carla Sinclair was born, so to speak, in January 1982 when, after long hours of coding in the quiet of my bedroom, I succeeded in printing her out on silvered thermal paper from my Sinclair ZX81. The routine just about filled the 1 KByte of memory I had at my disposal and I have to say it was a triumph of efficient programming for its day, an interlocking Chinese puzzle of nested loops and iterative algorithms. Of course, Carla didn't do anything. For all the effort I'd put in, she was just a picture, like a pencil drawing, except not nearly so precise. Indeed her pixels were rather blocky, on account of there being no real graphics capability on those early machines. The whole thing was something of a trick, an illusion achieved by printing out special text characters, line by line. But for all her shortcomings I could call her up at any time, having preserved her for all eternity on a Philips C60 cassette and though it sounds unbelievably antiquated nowadays, such a thing was quite special back then. She was an idea, if you like, the image of a woman - frozen, mysterious and somehow, to a young man on the cusp of manhood, she was curiously portentous - a phenomenon only barely grasped by the quaint technology of the day, like viewing a figure vaguely through hammered glass. Along with the ZX 81, Sinclair also brought out a 16 Kilobyte memory expansion. Now, relative to my income in those days, this little module cost quite a bit, and it meant saving up for a while, but the lure of all that memory eventually sent me anxiously in search of the nearest WH Smiths who were flogging them by the bucket load. What this gained me was the capacity to store a series of static poses of Carla, sixteen in all, each painstakingly defined as points on a 2D plane, their x-y co-ordinates copied from images I'd first traced onto graph paper and then reproduced as strings in the code. What it meant was that by playing the images one after the other I could actually make Carla move. It took a long time to crack that early program, to squeeze it into memory and get rid of the bugs, but eventually I had her walking from one side of my old portable TV screen to the other. Her movements were jerky, like a vintage flick-card routine. But this was state of the art back then, when Carla and I were young. Then the Sinclair Spectrum came out and it seemed to me as if technology were running away. The possibilities were endless and I simply had to have one. I sold my old push bike and a record player, saved up for several months and brought one home for Christmas 1983. I remember the feeling when I set it up in my bedroom, a mixture of excitement and reverence at the thought of the 48 Kilobytes of memory I now had to play with. The Spectrum gave Carla a more clearly delineated form with finer pixels and a proper two dimensional graphics. She also gained real freedom of movement, and I could control her a little better. I incorporated a scaling routine which meant I could have her turn her back on me and march off into an imaginary distance. With a good deal of tweaking and playing around with the timings I managed to get her movements to the stage where they were as fluid and convincing as any professionally drawn cartoon. Those of you reading this who remember those early Sinclair machines may also remember that the version of the BASIC programming language on the Spectrum was a little more advanced than on the ZX 81. Things were changing in the world of coding, and new directions were opening up. For-Next routines were already beginning to look a bit clumsy and I discovered ways you could compile the code into Assembly Language in order to make it run much faster. All in all there were more sophisticated ways of doing things and I spent a lot of time grappling with the implications of these changes, a thing that stood me in good stead for when, in 1985, Sinclair brought out the groundbreaking 128 Kilobyte QL, with a clock speed that now stood at an impressive 7.5 MHz. When the publicity leaflet dropped through the letterbox, I knew I had to have one. I printed out my Carla code on thermal paper and stored it safely, sold the Spectrum, the ZX81, and a raft of games, then cleared a space in my bedroom for the sexy black jewel of a machine the QL was back then. I realised of course I could now make Carla do just about anything: stand, sit, smile, wave,… it was purely a question of detail and having the patience to code it all up. The QL had opened all sorts of horizons and this brought about a turning point in Carla's evolution. To be blunt, I was a young man with a liking for the female form. So far, Carla had been modestly clothed but now I had the technology and the memory capacity to make her strip and parade naked,… indeed do all manner of things that in fantasy I had dreamed of seeing girls do. I admit to making a start along those lines by incorporating a routine that would cause her to wink and shimmy in a saucy fashion. Also I added a certain autonomy to her movements with the RND function, so I no longer had to walk her about myself with the arrow keys. But by now the code was getting up for a thousand lines long, and it was not nearly so easy to debug. For some inexplicable reason it kept branching to that wink routine, so Carla appeared to develop a nervous tick. I took this as an omen and decided not to pursue things any further in that direction. Carla was obviously not that sort of girl. Besides, by now I'd taken to leaving her running day and night and I didn't want my mother to come into my bedroom with the vacuum cleaner and find her doing something naughty. But there was more to it than that. Carla, for me, went beyond a certain natural prurience, into realms of psychology I did not then fully understand. Instead, I chose another direction and coded some background details so she had a little room with a table, a chair and a bed to sleep in. Then I incorporated a timer function so she ran in harmony with GMT and knew when it was the proper time to sleep. This was the point where she took on a fledgling life of her own and though it might sound strange to you, perhaps even a little sad, I liked to come home from the office to see what she was up to: looking out of the window, reading a book, combing her hair in the mirror, eating a sandwich,… mundane actions and fairly pointless you might say except Carla was something that had come out of me. And this alone gave her meaning. To me! Once, I woke up in the small hours to find her sitting on her bed instead of sleeping in it. This was immediately troubling and I stayed up until dawn trying to understand what was wrong. In the end it proved to be a simple bug, easy to fix but a devil to find. I mention this incident only to illustrate just how important Carla had become. It seemed I could have no peace unless everything was also running smoothly with her. All right. I was not completely unhinged. She was just a computer program, a crude simulation - at best a never ending animated cartoon with only one character and no story line. But she was ""something"",… a hobby I suppose you might say. Other young men had hobbies, equally obscure, though perhaps more socially inclusive. They collected camera gear, they went fishing, raced cars or drank themselves stupid. Me? I coded in my bedroom. Same thing? Well, not quite. You see, while other people's hobbies took them out of themselves, mine enabled me to climb deeper inside. But by now I was reaching the limit of what was possible, even with the QL. I had tried adding a little colour to Carla's life, painting her walls, adding a change of colour to her clothes, but it began to take its toll on frame rate and no matter how much I massaged the code I realised I was up against the laws of physics. It was down to the computer's clock speed, and the QL simply wasn't fast enough any more. Meanwhile, at the office, something strange was happening. It was around 1989 by now and typewriters were disappearing. Secretaries were being given IBM computers, the so called PS2, based on the new Intel 80286 chip. This was an altogether different beast to the QL, a blank slate if you like. PC's had been around since 1981 but they'd always seemed terribly clunky things to me - big, expensive and up till then not a patch on the QL in terms of clock speed and RAM. But the PS2 was different: it was a foretaste of things to come. The PS2 had a huge re-writable disk for storage and a memory capacity of around a megabyte, which beggared belief. You could basically make this machine do anything you wanted, and it was no end of frustration for me having to watch while secretaries hacked out bits of memos on it when I could have been using it to take Carla and her world to new heights of reality. But of course buying an IBM back then was unthinkable: they cost as much as a second hand car. Plus, around about that time I got married and my wife didn't like Carla running all day,… I mean not even in the spare room. She had this thing about leaving appliances plugged in overnight. What if it caused a fire? It made no difference that Carla had been running more or less non stop now for five years without so much as a warm plug. Carla, it seemed, had reached the end of the road,… and the plug was pulled. I was in my late twenties by now and realising that pretty much everything you want to do in life involves some sort of compromise. To be fair, I was having a ball with my wife, and Carla simply wasn't that important any more. In what bits of spare time I had, I modified the QL to take a floppy drive and Carla lived on that in discrete isolation for weeks on end. I also modified the code to include a save-state routine which meant she could pick up from wherever I'd last switched her off. But it wasn't the same, not being able to just casually glance at the screen whenever I felt like it in order to see what she was doing. Slowly then, Carla slipped into the background of my life. I remember running her for an hour or so one evening until she went to bed. At that point I saved her state and shut her down. It was 9 PM July the 10th 1992. Then I went into the bathroom and found my wife holding a little plastic thing that told us she was pregnant. Life became rather blurry after that. One child followed the other, the house became too small, so we moved, renovated, moved and renovated again. What with all the fuss, it was August the 4th 1997 before I rediscovered the QL lurking in an unopened packing box in the attic. By this time the QL had become something of a curiosity in computer circles. I brought it down into the spare room and switched it on. With a struggle I remembered the instructions in order to access the floppy and I loaded Carla into memory. She threw back the sheets, walked to the mirror in her night-dress, yawned, stretched and combed out her hair - all as if nothing had happened. But she'd lost 5 years! I'd forgotten what she looked like, how well she moved. I don't know why this touched me, but it did and that's when my eldest daughter came into the spare room to find her daddy crying. Clearly I had underestimated what I was dealing with. I'd known lads at college who'd spent night after night coding a sort of quasi 3D shoot-em-up game to run on their Commodore VICs. Then they'd moved on to flight simulators, and rally games, but always the challenge for them was the code, trying to find ways of doing more with less, fighting against the limitations of memory and clock speed. For me though, code was always secondary. The creation, Carla, was of primary importance, important enough to make a grown man cry at the thought of all those wasted years. If I'd only kept it up, what might Carla be capable of now? At that time, I was living in a four bed detached executive brick-box, and I drove a brand new Rover 216. I worked in a shipping office, which largely involved tapping figures into a spreadsheet. Things had moved on apace since those first Intel processors, and now most of us in the office, even middle rankers like me had an early Pentium on his desk. I asked my wife if I could buy one, but she couldn't see the point, even though we could easily have afforded it by then. ""What would you do with it?"" she asked. And I was at a loss to answer because I knew she would not understand. To her Carla was just some quirky cartoon her husband had knocked up in his spare time. He'd snapped his fingers in some geeky, technical way that didn't really interest her, and I'm sure she thought me a little sad, a little childish perhaps. Carla made the children giggle but beyond that there was no practical purpose to her being. Curiously, my wife's lack of understanding was instrumental in making me sit down and seriously try to understand it myself. But my conclusions at that time fell short of discovering the real truth. Carla was a part of me, a part that went back to my boyhood - that's all I knew - and in some fuzzy headed way, I suspected she still had a part to play. We had grown up together, she and I, and in exploring her there had always been a sense that in some way I had also been exploring a part of myself. Married life in middle age had for me become less about being with someone, and more about my perceived responsibilities - towards the children, towards not letting my wider circle of family down, of maintaining the house in good repair, and inevitably it was about keeping up with appearances, such as mowing the lawn regularly and making sure the car was always as shiny as the neighbours'. It's a maddeningly false business of course - the cliché of suburban life. Consequently a man needs a hobby in his middle years, perhaps more than at any other time - fishing rods, golf clubs,… something, anything to take him out of himself and remind him of who he is, who he was, but above all to give him a glimmer of hope that all is not lost, that he might still become the person he always thought he would one day be. In short a man needs to construct a fantasy of his reality, or his reality of fantasy will slowly crush him. I brought home a Pentium 2 in the Autumn of 1998. This caused some marital friction, but I weathered it. I bought books on C++ and began the long haul of bringing Carla up to date, for I had come to the conclusion that BASIC had run to the end of what I wanted to achieve with it. I needed something faster, something that worked more closely with the guts of the machine itself, something that could more easily tickle the noughts and the ones into life, make the machine sing and dance, make it fly! I studied games like Quake and Doom. These were fast, blast-em-up first person shooters, and I boggled at their scale. Here were entire three dimensional worlds coded into a silicon memory, realistic and immersive, while poor Carla existed as a lone two dimensional sprite, in a primitively drawn room. So it began: late nights; spare-bedroom coding, while my wife turned in early, and didn't seem to notice my creeping to bed in the small hours, bleary eyed and yet too stimulated to sleep. Things had moved on a lot since those days of two dimensional sprites and, similarly, bedroom coders had moved on from Pacman and Hungry Horace into writing three dimensional engines for games that seemed fantastic to me at first. Eventually though, these games all began to look the same: guns and power-ups, improbable aliens and ever more realistic gore. Of course, the people writing these games were probably only half my age and for all their obvious intelligence, they began to seem like little more than children. They were weaving miracles out of the code and using it to make a child's game. Carla wasn't like that though. She had never been a game, but then not quite a simulation either. Indeed I had yet to define exactly what she was. Over those first months of labour on the P2, she became a three dimensional animation, her room a proper 3D model. And beyond the window she gazed out of every morning I modelled a 3D landscape with hills and trees that grew and shed their leaves according to the season. In the code I began including behavioural routines based on body states. How long had she been awake? Was she tired? Was she hungry? Did she need to use the toilet? And I let her body states determine her behaviour patterns, instead of it being a purely random function - if she was tired, she sat down. If she was hungry, she ate. The P2 had a 3D accelerator card and 128 megabytes of memory. No longer was Carla a monochrome cartoon but full colour and eerily realistic. There were lights in her room that she could switch on and off for mood and effect. I programmed her to prefer a softer atmosphere and in the evening, when her darkness fell, she would sit in the intimate glow of lamplight holding a book, as if she were reading. When she was happy, she would flick her hair and twitch her toe as if to music. I had programmed all of these reponses.I knew she was not alive, but it still made me feel good when she appeared to be happy. By now she moved like a real person, sat down like a real person and I had even added a routine so that her chest rose and fell as if she were breathing. Her eyes blinked, her lips moved,… and incredibly, for all this coding, I had not yet exceeded even one tenth of the machine's capacity. The technology was no longer a limiting factor in what might be achieved. Now the limitation was my own ingenuity, and having a clear idea of where I wanted to go. The next stage was more dangerous for me and revived memories of my first attempts at turning Carla into some sort of digital tart. My aim seemed to be in achieving as much autonomy and realism as possible and there was something missing in this regard that could only be captured by the addition of her occasional nudity, plus granting her the freedom to dress as she chose. This was not voyeurism, but a necessary stage to be gone through. Over the years of my marriage I had grown used to casually encountering the occasional domestic nudity of my wife, and so it seemed a similar stage was appropriate for me and Carla, a coming of age so to speak - a sort of marriage in which I could observe her form without embarrassment. Modelling the mesh of her unclothed body gave me pleasure, but not in a prurient sense. And even painting the highly detailed texture of her skin and her intimate areas filled me with something more akin to reverence than simple arousal. I modelled her underwear and a basic wardrobe in a variety of colours and simulated fabrics for her to choose from. The whole thing worked like a dream! Now Carla rose in the morning, showered, dressed, then entered her living quarters and made ready to start the day. It was a triumph, and so wonderful a thing to watch, I always made sure I was up early enough to witness it. But where was all of this going? I'd hit my middle forties by now and the sum total of my life seemed to be a family who were growing ever more distant, a job I couldn't wait to retire from and an obsession with a computer animated woman whose well being I cared for enough to stay up all night nursing the bug ridden code out of her system. But she was not alive. She was not even a she. I could have changed her sprite into one depicting a giant chicken and the program would have worked just the same. I was not losing my mind. I understood all of these things, but still I could not rest unless everything was well with Carla. Of course, it was her feminine line that gave her meaning. An artist who paints nudes all his life is seeking something more through the female form than is visible to a less sensitive eye that sees only the naughty bits. Similarly for me, it was something inside - something about her form that haunted me. Carla had become a means of self expression, self exploration: Carla was art. Only when I read the works of Carl Jung, the Zurich psychologist, was the mystery partially solved. Inside the unconscious mind of every man, you see, there is an archetype that's female in nature - an archetype being a focus for a particular blend of psychic energy within the unconscious. And if a man is genuine in wanting to understand himself, he can only do it if he engages with the feminine side of his own nature. Then the woman inside of him can speak through dreams, through fantasy, and instruct him, guide him through the deeper parts of himself. Some men have a lot of difficulty with this sort of thing and believe it involves going around dressing up in women's clothes, or behaving in an effeminate or overly emotional way. It can come to that if the woman within gets out of hand and the man ends up possessed by her,… but if he can avoid that fate, if he is curious about where the woman might lead him, then he can embark upon an inner journey, an obsession with what is nothing short of the mystery of the universe itself. It is the age old quest, the meaning of life, the Philosopher's Stone. Suddenly, it all became clear. My work with Carla was nothing less than alchemy. Carla was the reflection of an unconscious archetype that over the years had taken on an ever more realistic representation. But how much further could I logically pursue this? I was still in full control of her. Her choice of clothes, her actions, her moods - all was down to me through the lines I'd coded. Any apparent autonomy was little more than an illusion afforded by the ever convenient RND function of the computer - the random number algorithm. Coding is a natural extension of logical thought. It is the embodiment of determinism. For all its arcane language, it is like Newtonian clockwork, and the random numbers of the RND function are not really random at all. They are the output of an algorithm, like COS and SIN - same seed, same random sequence,… every time. Real randomness is quite different. For a start it is impossible to code. And there is something else about real randomness, something disturbing if you look at it closely enough. Over the years I had become interested in the statistical properties of randomness and also the apparent ease with which it manifests itself in nature. As humans we convince ourselves that the world looks a certain way. Every effect has a defining cause and therefrom spring all the laws of physics and mathematics that we rely upon to make sense of things. Yet something that is truly random, such as the decay of a radioactive substance, or even the time series produced by something so mundane as the dripping of a tap is an effect without any clearly definable cause. So the closer you look at life, the less solid appear the foundations upon which everything is built. Randomness is impossible to code, yet it exists everywhere in nature. You can toss a coin and that's as near random as its possible for a human to achieve, but it's hard to do this fast enough in order to provide a stream of random digits that will keep up with a processor running at 350 Megacycles. You can buy an RNG of course, a random number generator - a little black box that you plug into the parallel port of your computer. This device works on the decay of a radioactive material, the particles it releases being detected by an electronic apparatus and the timings converted into random numbers - real random numbers. These things aren't cheap but if you put off changing the car for a year they're not beyond the pocket of the ordinary chap - not so easy to explain to one's wife though, just what it is you've spent your money on. But what can I say? An RNG was something I simply had to have! It took just a couple of minutes to modify the code so Carla called upon the RNG, instead of on the RND algorithm. Then, I set her running and watched her for a while. There was no real difference of course, at least none that I could see. Carla rose about the same time, showered, put on a pink top and the new jeans I'd recently modelled for her. Then she sat down to read. Of course, there was no visible difference at all - except I knew I had now broken the link between Carla and the machine. Her movements and her behaviour might have been structured by the code, but those actions were now invoked by a stream of digits coming from the mysterious abyss at the quantum level of reality. This was important. It was the point at which she and I began to merge more closely into one, the point at which I began a serious dialogue with my unconscious mind, and with the universe from whence I had come. There are those who argue, plausibly, that human consciousness has its origins in the quantum level of reality. Therefore, in this sense, Carla and I now had something in common. What underpinned her actions in her world was the same as what underpinned me, in mine. My own every day reality was reaching a sort of climax, but one that had nothing to do with Quantum Physics. I was fifty one and my kids had gone off to university. The house seemed empty without them and it had been on my mind to talk to my wife about the possibility of moving down to a smaller place, perhaps release some capital so I could think more seriously about retiring early. Then I came home from the office one evening to discover she'd already found a smaller place, but didn't intend for us to share it on account of her already having someone else in mind. It took a while to iron out all the details, but I eventually found myself separated and alone, living in a little terraced house on the outskirts of town. The place was a bit of a wreck but I managed to buy it outright and, compared to the other house, it cost virtually nothing to run. A little paint and paper and it was as good as new. There was nowhere to park the car on account of the main road that ran outside, but then I was only a short walk from the bus station anyway, so I sold the car, then walked into PC World and bought the best computer I could find with the proceeds. It had several gigabytes of memory and a clock speed in the region of four gigacycles, and the chip ran so hot it needed a refrigeration system to keep it from breaking down. It was an extravagance I suppose since even after twenty five years of development Carla was a long way yet from outgrowing my antiquated P2. But as I have already explained, a man needs something in his life, a focus for his attention and I did not trouble myself over the expense. Then the office looked set to merge with a bigger outfit from Manchester and everyone over the age of fifty got the boot,… including me. I remember coming home that night to an empty house and wondering what the hell I was going to do. But of course I didn't actually need to do anything. I'd have a redundancy package, even a small pension. I'd no expenses to speak of, no responsibilities, and although I was rather poor and had little to show in material terms for my half century of life, at least I was free. There would be no more bedroom coding until the small hours, then whiling away the long, empty days at work until I could get back to the keyboard. I could code all day! I could spread myself out, sit down and really think this thing through! Carl Jung had exposed Carla as a manifestation of my deepest psyche. But what did that mean exactly? I could go on tweaking and embellishing her world, open the doors on her room and let her explore the scenery I'd coded for her, people her world with other 3D characters,… but to what end? If Carla was an image of my female archetype, and she was somehow supposed to guide me towards my life's goal, then she had to communicate, she had to point me in a certain direction. I had experimented with giving Carla a voice and some basic sentences for her to speak, but the interpretation routines had been hopelessly wooden, making her sound like a simpleton. Besides, any words I gave her were essentially my own. I couldn't ask her anything and then expect her to answer in a meaningful way. That required Artificial Intelligence, and while AI might have been within the realms of possibility for the likes of IBM and Bell Laboratories, it was beyond the ability and the sheer man hours available to a lone hobby coder like me. But then, curiously, I began to study divination systems and I hit upon the next phase in Carla's development. It was a mixture of coincidence and serendipity, an offshoot of the work on randomness and the writings of Carl Jung. Divination, I discovered, is not so much the prediction of the future, as I had believed, but more a way of measuring the present moment, of gauging the balance of probabilities as they pertain to you, personally. Understanding the present, and the forces at play, usually by studying a random event, one is able to guess the future with a measure of confidence - if you believe in that sort of thing of course! I'll be honest. This was not really my cup of tea. In my world, even randomness was a predictable phenomenon, so talk of divination went against the grain. But it also intrigued me just enough to explore it a little further - the possibility that a truly random event like the tossing of a coin, or the pattern of some chicken bones scattered upon the ground, or the decay of a radioactive substance could somehow reach back into the void between the atoms and truly gauge a moment in time,… Of course there are many systems of divination, most of them as old as the hills like the Chinese Kuan Yin and the I Ching, to name but two. However, by far the simplest I came across was one based upon the random selection of either a black or a white stone. You ask a question to which there is a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. If you draw the white stone, the answer is ""yes"", if it is a black one, the answer is ""no"". But this seemed rather silly to me because, naturally, if you ask the same question more than once you have a 50-50 chance of getting a different answer. The texts described this sort of thing as importuning the oracle, and said that any answer after the first time of asking could not be relied upon. It was the first answer that mattered, even if it was not the one you wanted to hear. Nor were you allowed to test the oracle by asking if it was going to rain tomorrow and then wait to see before deciding to suspend your disbelief in the system. Consciously testing the oracle like this produced meaningless answers in the same way as importuning. This seemed like something of a cop-out - the half baked explanations of a primitive and childish mind. But for all my early skepticism, I decided to give it a try and spent a number of days modelling an annex to Carla's room. In it was a table with a chair. On the table I placed a hollow cone which covered a sphere. By picking up the cone, Carla revealed the sphere, whose colour remained uncertain until the moment the cone was removed. The colour, black or white, was decided via a branch instruction that read random digits from the RNG device. Further to this I decided to allow myself some input into the degree of randomness by actually speaking my question into a microphone which the program analysed, reduced to a string of binary code and combined it with the output from the RNG. The way all this worked, I would begin by hitting the space key which would call Carla into the divination room. She would take a seat at the table facing me and indicate her readiness by opening her palms. I would ask my question, then she would respond by lifting the cone to reveal her answer ""yes"" or ""no"". All of this might seem an extravagance when any random binary event might have offered the same functionality. I could have done the same thing by simply tossing a coin. Heads is ""yes"" and ""tails"" is no. Yet for all of the logic in that argument, it was an irrational obsession with Carla that had brought me this far in the first place, so from the outset the oracle had to work through Carla for it to have any meaning. I could toss a coin, but not trust the answer sufficiently to stake my life on it. But if the answer came through Carla, it came from the very depths of me, and though I was aware of the irrationality of it, the answer meant something if only because by that point in my life, I truly wanted to believe in it. By now I was transmitting Carla's world from the computer in the spare room to a channel on the T.V. and I was communicating via a wireless keyboard and a Bluetooth headset. This meant I could stretch out in comfort on the settee and keep a casual eye on whatever she was doing. This way the house did not seem empty any more. Carla was always around, always doing something of interest. All I had to do was turn on the TV. Hitting the spacebar made a little sound like a ringing bell and caused an interrupt in the program which called Carla into the divination room, but I didn't have priority. If she was emotionally low, or tired, she would not always respond, so I had to be careful in what demands I placed upon her. This was important in ensuring I did not abuse the oracular interface. If my attitude towards the spirit of the oracle remained correct, then I would not tire Carla with trivial questions and I would not bother her willy nilly at inconvenient times of day. She was always fresher in the mornings and so after finalising the program details one evening, I waited impatiently until the following day, after breakfast, before consulting her for the very first time. My heart was in my mouth when I rang the bell, not certain if she would respond, and more than a little fearful of my first question. After a moment or two, Carla came into the room, sat down and opened her palms in readiness. I took a moment to compose myself, then spoke into the headset. ""Carla."" How strange the feeling of actually speaking her name! ""Carla, is there any meaning to what I've been doing with you all these years?"" Carla waited until she was sure I'd finished speaking. She distilled my words into a string of code, read the moment from the RNG, made a calculation then reached over and lifted the cone to reveal a shiny white sphere. ""Yes."" ""Thank you,"" I said. She blinked and pursed her lips a fraction - purely random affectations - but she made no reply since I had not called for one. Did her answer mean anything? Who was to say, since asking for clarification would have been to importune and to test at the same time. I had to go with the moment, and the moment suggested an affirmation of everything I had done since those far away days with the Sinclair ZX 81. It's a remarkable thing, you know, suspending disbelief and trusting in something that a lifetime of rationality tells you is complete nonsense. It's like bunking off school. It's like taking an illicit drag on a cigarette behind the bike-sheds. But it's more than a feeling. Indeed, once I began to accept Carla's answers as fundamental truths I noticed a change in my own psyche. I became more relaxed. There was no need to try to understand the world around me any more. I could simply ask Carla. It was as if she had lifted a great weight from my shoulders. To give you an example of what I mean, there had long been a problem in the neighbourhood with stray dogs fouling the pavements. This was something I found particularly galling since the cursed creatures seemed also to favour my front doorstep as a dumping place. I informed the council, but in spite of the fifteen hundred pounds I paid them every year for their services, they couldn't seem to find the time to sort it out. I asked Carla: ""Should I pursue it further?"" ""No."" ""But it makes me so angry. Are you saying I'm overreacting?"" ""Yes."" ""I should simply forget about it then?"" ""Yes."" I stopped using the front door after that. Instead, I made more of an exit through my back garden which let out onto a meadow on the edge of town, and as Carla had suggested, I more or less forgot about the street. The dog muck could be piled up to the letter box for all I know, but it doesn't bother me any more. Indeed I rarely think about it. That was Carla's message: sometimes we do not need to solve a problem. The better solution is to transcend it altogether. I thought about other things such as: ""Was my marriage fundamentally flawed?"" ""No."" ""Do my children hate me for the disintegration of our family?"" ""No."" ""Are the latest bombings yet another sign that the world is descending into anarchy and chaos?"" ""No."" Chaos. The shadowy half brother of randomness - an apparently erratic behaviour, but with a simple equation at its root; determinism gone bad; randomness from pattern, and then suddenly patterns crystallising from the amorphous fog of randomness, like a Mozart serenade crystallising from the hiss of static. Like Carla's answers. Possibly. Now, just to be clear, there was no evidence either way that Carla's answers were anything other than random and meaningless. Indeed the only meaning was what I had chosen to attach to them. ""Should I go to library today?"" ""No."" ""The swimming pool then?"" ""Yes."" You might say I was deluding myself, but I was happy to,… and yet, what if the source of her motivation were indeed chaotic in nature and through the iterations of her code I had struck upon a remarkable pattern? What if divination were not some shadowy occult practice, but a technique that reached to the very depths of nature in a way that science had yet to comprehend? As I thought about our interaction, it gradually became apparent that a simple ""yes"" and ""no"" answer was insufficient. It suited the programmer in me to work in binary terms, but the real world doesn't come in binary form, in black and white,… the real world comes in shades of grey. There are rarely simple yes-no answers to the really important questions, and sometimes the only answer is that we are not asking the right question, that we need to look at the problem another way because we are missing the point entirely. There is a need in life for fuzziness, for uncertainty. So I gave Carla a third option, a grey, pearly sphere, neither black nor white. And then I asked her: ""Do you have everything you need?"" ""Uncertain,"" she replied. ""Think deeper."" So I thought deeper. Carla was a part of me, so perhaps the question should have been: ""Do you have everything that we need?"" ""No."" ""Aha!"" There was more to do. But what? Carla's confinement had been bothering me for a long time. She occupied just a few rooms in an infinite void and even the external details of the box that held her were left undefined. The landscape I had created around her domain was, for all its textured richness, a mere illusion, a stage backdrop to hide the uncoded darkness beyond her window. But I got to wondering if there wasn't something worth exploring out there, some potential that was being squandered, so I built rather a grand hallway with a smart panelled door, and taught her how to open it. ""Is this what we need, Carla?"" ""Yes."" It was a static landscape at first, the equivalent of a few hundred square miles, with her rooms at the geographical centre. The trick of course was letting Carla loose in all this space, while ensuring she made her way back before she grew tired and hungry. Then I got the idea of actually adding to the landscape day by day, depending upon a random function. To this end I modelled a small safe zone around Carla's rooms which I titled The Central Domain and I marked it out with a decorative stone wall. Beyond this demarkation, there grew a strip of randomly determined landscape which extended itself daily by a radius of about a hundred meters, like a ripple moving steadily outwards on the flat surface of a pond. The nature of each new strip of terrain was determined each morning by the program dialling up an Internet connection and reading the first thousand words of news from the BBC's web site. This was distilled in a certain way so as to render a matrix heightfield which I then tweaked in order to generate a gently rounded landscape dotted with lakes, trees and mountains. Looking out upon the scene, it was like a fog slowly receding, revealing day by day some new feature, a new twist in the curve of a lake or the fall of a cliff. I recorded the effects of Carla's journeys into this expanding wilderness, on her body state as a string of binary code, then added this to the calculations which determined the outcome of both her behaviour and our conversations. I also further restricted my own access to Carla by ensuring that she only heard the calling bell within the confines of Central Domain. When she was at large, I could see where she was and what she was doing, but I had to wait until she returned before I could talk to her. Over the period of a few weeks a shallow lake took shape within easy reach of Central Domain and I noted that her steps would often take her to its shore. Trees had formed in clumps and there was a sandy bay. I had programmed Carla to take pleasure from reading and walking. When she read, the data she took in was a random stream of numbers from the RNG, when she walked, the data was also a random stream based on what she saw. Her pleasure state therefore added to the growing file of data that was now based upon her daily experience. What I was looking for were patterns of behaviour emerging from this veritable deluge of genuinely random input. Could an underlying structure be discerned from her daily routines and from her answers to my questions? The lake was an attractive place and I recalled the pleasure I took in swimming, so I taught Carla to swim and to enjoy it also. So, all through the summer one year Carla made a habit of picking out a little pink swimsuit each morning before heading off to the lake where she would swim for hours. But as Autumn came on it grew too cold for swimming and she began instead to wander more among the randomly advancing forests, along the lake-shore and into the wilderness beyond, to other forests, other lakes that revealed themselves as our creative horizon receded from view. I always felt some anxiety at these wanderings. The code was becoming so big and so complex now I feared losing control of it - some imbalance taking over which might prevent her from returning. Beyond the random landscape there existed only an invisible, infinite plane. If she found a way through my safeguards there was a chance she might fall off the edge of her world. Another concern at this stage was that her behaviour was such a complex thing. The day's mood, the day's balance of emotion depended in part upon the previous day's state, up to her going to bed. In this sense the mood she rose with was based upon an iterative calculation, and such routines are notoriously prone to chaotic behaviour. It meant there was always a risk that Carla could get ""stuck"" in a particular pattern of actions, doing the same pointless thing over and over with a regular periodicity. Or her behaviour could become wildly unpredictable - sleep patterns disturbed, not showering, not dressing, wandering in the dark, going about naked all the time,… a sort of mental breakdown. Of course you might say that, in the event of such a catastrophic aberration, I could easily have corrected things by resetting the program, by simply clearing out the accumulated store of offending data and starting again, but then would it have been Carla who awoke from such a drastic intervention? She relied so much upon the currency of the time, the flavour of the ""now"" that even yesterday's saved state would not have defined her sufficiently for her to have had any real meaning to me. In a sense, Carla would have slipped behind time. She would have died and been replaced by an impostor whose answers in the divination room I could not have brought myself to trust. Eventually, the evolving landscape passed beyond the radius that Carla could reach on foot in one day. This was a problem because it meant that the potential of the land to impress itself upon her was essentially wasted. The best she could do was climb a mountain within a long day's walk from her domain and gaze out at the ever widening horizons. The simplest solution was to provide outposts, little cabins she might stock with food from Central Domain. So I positioned a ring of them, all the same, about a day's walk away. They were comfortable little places with a bed, bathroom, heat, light and so on. Indeed the only restriction I placed on them was the fact that they had to rely on Central Domain and on Carla's effort for their supply of food. I programmed sufficient intelligence for Carla to work out that she could take food and use it to stock the cabins. The decision then, either to explore further beyond these outposts, or return to base was entirely hers. It took a while for this modification to have any effect, but eventually Carla found her way to a cabin, and then returned to it some days later with a supply of food, enough to last her for that night, and the following one. I rose early, that first morning of her encampment abroad, so to speak, and it was with a mixture of satisfaction and dismay that I watched her set out towards that ever broadening horizon. I knew this would alter her in some way. It was what I had intended, but it would be another two days before she made it back to Central Domain. Two days before I could talk to her again. And speaking to Carla was what I lived for now. Naturally, throughout her wanderings abroad I could keep an eye on her via a camera that hovered over her shoulder. I could also read her body state from a pop-up menu, but I could not communicate with her. It took many months to evaluate the effect of extending Carla's range in this way, and my conclusion at the end of it all was that it had made not one jot of visible difference. She stuck to the valleys where the going was less steep, less tiring, and so more economical on her reserves. Also, she would seek out water, not simply to drink, but because she had always had a liking for it. The landscape was much of a sameness, just the odd irregularity where the days events, as defined by the BBC news feed, had stuck in a particular groove and somehow effected the contours of the hills. By my calculations, even by extending her range with the use of outposts, the land we were exploring had been generated nearly a year ago. The time line, the creative horizon in Carla's world was already overwhelming, but even if she could take in the whole sweep of it, every single grass textured facet, would it have made any difference? One of the problems in this regard was entirely practical and concerned the fact that this unfolding ripple of creation was eating away more and more memory, at a rate that was proportional to the square of the radius from Central Domain. I installed a 500 gigabyte drive just to handle it, even though there seemed little point if Carla was unable to explore its environs. In a moment of doubt I asked her: ""Is it important to us that we go on expanding our horizons at this rate?"" ""Yes."" ""Is it that we're going to discover something by doing this?"" ""Think deeper."" ""I fear something might go wrong and I'll lose you. Is this likely?"" ""Think deeper."" ""The risk of losing you is somehow important?"" ""Yes."" ""You must be given the means to travel further, to experience the edge of this creative horizon?"" ""Yes."" ""And I must accept the possibility of losing you?"" ""Yes."" The thought of losing her troubled me to the very depths of my soul but equally I could not have disobeyed her. There was only one reasonable means of doing what she asked, and that was to create some sort of vehicle. I could have cheated and invented a particle transporter, so she might beam herself to any location she chose, but in life it is not always the destination that is crucial to our understanding of things, but rather it is the journey we undertake. I wondered about an aircraft, or a jeep, but settled on a futuristic scout vessel, like a Dan Dare space ship. It drew its energy from the sun which limited its daylight range to about 6 hours in the summer, with a further six being required to charge. The propulsion technology was undefined, entirely imaginary and totally improbable, something to do with using solar energy to extract hydrogen from water. But this did have the effect of ensuring that Carla would always have to look for a lake by which she could set down in order to replenish her fuel supply. While I was at it, I improved the weather generation systems so that it was not always uniformly sunny. Sometimes, the daily news reading brought in squalls of rain or gusts of wind. These effected temperatures and I made sure that Carla did not like to be caught out in the cold and the wet. It made her irritable. It drained her reserves and, since it obscured the sun, it also made the charging of her vessel a less predictable business. The craft was ready to fly on my fifty eighth birthday. It could travel at around Mach 1, without any discomfort and was luxuriously fitted out so Carla could feel at home wherever her journey took her. I did program in a limitation on the supplies she might carry, so as to restrict her range. The plan was to compel her to return to Central Domain at least once a week, then I might talk to her, but her first flights involved food-drops, journeying out in various directions and leaving stashes of food, as I had taught her to do with the cabins. This came as a surprise to me. It was as if she were deliberately challenging my will, so I limited the time the food could be left in the open before spoiling and this brought her back more often, but I felt I had broken our agreement to grant her more freedom to explore, and so I relented, providing for her a supply of special containers which included a sort of solar refrigerator and a homing beacon. This kept the food indefinitely and allowed her to make a series of strategic drops. But then I saw to it that she never slept as well in the vessel, nor could she shower as comfortably and so, over the duration of a long trip, her personal comfort levels were eroded and she would eventually return, just to clean herself up. This was reasonable I thought, and a concession I had no intentions of giving up on. Those early voyages were boring. Long hours in real-time, skimming cloudbase over an undulating landscape, with only the occasional lake or forest to break up the monotony. I calculated the creative horizon was no more than a couple of days' flight from Central Domain, but this seemed to interest Carla less than a haphazard criss-crossing of the hills and valleys. Once, we set down on the sandy shore of a vast lake. It was as yet early morning. The sky was clear and Carla seemed intent on letting the vessel charge. She took on water, and collected food from a drop she'd made some days before - all of it suggesting a strategy,… a pattern of intent. Then Carla refreshed herself by spending the whole day swimming. Her personal comfort levels rose alarmingly as the water cleansed and refreshed her and I knew then that even if she slept poorly, I would not see her in the divination room at Central Domain for another week or so. She had found yet another way to avoid returning home. I lay upon the couch that evening, watching while she sat out by the lakeside, the cockpit glass of the vessel glinting in the sunlight behind her. She had brought a book from home and was reading, tapping her toes as if to music and flicking her hair. She was happy, it seemed, to be abroad. But how could she be happy? For all the complexity of the code that underpinned her, this was still a simulation and any talk of emotion was entirely delusional - except, it made me sad that she would not come home and talk to me. I had given her the means to be governed by data at the quantum level of reality, the quantum source, so to speak, and now the source was taking her from me. The first time we went to the edge was a profoundly disturbing experience. The vessel registered its proximity with a warning signal and even though I'd programmed this myself, it was a sound that sent a shiver down my spine, and brought me running from the bathroom where I had been taking a shower. I stood there in the living room, wrapped only in a towel, gazing at the TV screen, to find myself on the very edge, a place I'd rendered opaque by the introduction of a spherical dome of greenish tinted cloud. Beyond it, invisible in the unprogrammed void, lay nothing but the future - which was as yet undetermined. If she breached this barrier, the vessel would lose its bearings, which were all based upon triangulations of the known landscape. Beyond this point there was no way of knowing which way was up, down, left or right. In the known realm, which extended from the beginning of time up to the present moment, all things were defined by their position relative to each other, but beyond that creative horizon, beyond the future, there was no reference, no way back. We would have to wait until the past caught up with us, and hope our reserves would last that long. Of course when Carla's reserves fell below a certain level she would become irrational, unreliable, or she would take to her bed in an effort to recharge herself. But without food, she would eventually flatline and the code would branch to a sort of gosub-end instruction. In other words, Carla would die. However, as we hovered on the edge of the unknown, I told myself this was unthinkable. The purpose of Carla was to teach me something about myself and the meaning of my existence. If it ended now, I would have learned nothing. Fortunately, Carla understood fear. It was a concession to my including the gosub-end routine; she had to fear the end in order that she might take all natural precautions to avoid it. I checked her body state on the pop up menu and to my relief, her fear was considerable. That was why we'd stopped. She was calculating the chances of making it back. I knew the moment she made her decision because I saw the fear levels fall. Then the vessel turned and we headed directly for Central Domain. We'd been away for three weeks and both our nerves were shot. It was the second time in my life that Carla made me cry. The weeks that followed were curious in their own way in that Carla was confined to her rooms on account of poor weather. A thick blanket of cloud had formed, preventing the vessel from charging properly, and her aversion to rain meant that she spent the entire time indoors. But there was more: there were brief spells of sunshine and these should have had some effect on the vessel, but its fuel cells remained empty. There was a bug in the code,… a combination of events that I had not tested for, our journey to the edge perhaps? I worked on it for days, but control of the vessel was a complex matter and the solution proved to be elusive. I printed out the routines and laid them down on the carpet, a task that covered the whole of my front room. Then I went through line by line and concluded that the problem was not in the code I had originally written. Some time ago, as an experiment, I had introduced routines that enabled the code to modify itself. This is not so bizarre as it might sound and indeed any program that begins from a previous saved state has to some extent overwritten its own routines. The danger is of course that if bugs creep in, then the code can degenerate into rubbish. Then the program can fail entirely, or certain elements of it might become unreliable. I solved the problem by overwriting the vessel's routines, resetting it if you like - but only the vessel:Carla remained unchanged. I checked with her first and she said it was okay. Sure enough, the vessel began to charge normally and Carla began to anticipate journeying abroad again. But then I noticed a problem with the textures on the wallpaper in her bedroom. They had turned from a delicately mottled blue into a flat, untextured grey. It was at this point, I felt the bottom fall out of my world. The vessel had infected Central Domain, Carla's one reliable means of support. As an emergency measure I fixed up one of the cabin outposts to a similar level of comfort, then moved her food supply and the divination interface there as well. It proved to be a wise move for within couple of days the whole interior of Central Domain was a flat, uniform grey, and all the power-ups in terms of comfort and hygiene had failed. The greyness had the immediate effect of draining her reserves. Carla's well-being was now a matter of the utmost importance. If I couldn't fix the bug there would be nothing to stop the corruption from reaching the outposts and then it would be a desperate struggle to keep always one step ahead of things. The safest course was to equip the vessel with everything she needed, and then at least she might use it to travel about, to keep away from possible harm. I cannot describe how anxious a time that was. The code defining Central Domain was old and, I had thought, the most stable - indeed the very bedrock of Carla's world. But not any more. The textures were still there in the machine's memory, but not being written somehow. Also some of the models, the furnishings and fittings were similarly not being written to the screen. The world was turning grey and the detail was decaying back into a featureless plain. Was this entirely a problem with the code or was there some quirk of the language I did not fully understand? Within a month, the outposts had gone too and the centre of Carla's world was rendered flat and grey, like a huge eye, like an expanding plane of nothingness. She would enter it occasionally and wander around - the void was not openly hostile, merely unsustaining - a sort of dead zone. I performed an experiment in order to measure the rate of its advance, and it seemed to match that of the creative horizon. Creation and corruption were advancing in unison. Carla's world was expanding like a ring in the void. She might set off in one direction and if she flew far enough, she would arrive back where she had started from, but she would never again be at the centre of her world. After a lifetime of programming, I had become reasonably competent at it, but I was by no means an expert and after months of frustration I had to conclude that the solution was beyond me. I had lost control of the code. For now, it seemed to have stabilised, though in a strangely perverse way, eating itself up from the middle while expanding like a doughnut shaped balloon. Of course, I was afraid to undertake any modifications at all now in case I only made things worse. Thus, I was terrified of Carla venturing again to within warning distance of the creative horizon and bringing back another bug, because then I would have been powerless to make any repairs. Though by now I reckoned our days were numbered, she in fact seemed quite cheerful, touring the lake sites, swimming, eating, sleeping, exploring the forests on foot, then moving on before the grey void caught us up and ate everything away. It lent a strange transience to our existence, an arrow to our direction, for ever outwards, towards the future. My only comfort in all of this was that I now had more regular contact with Carla. Naturally, I could not call her into the divination chamber when she was piloting the vessel, or sleeping, or if she had wandered away from the landing site, but there was always some point in the day when I could sit down with her and talk. ""Is this the end Carla?"" ""Think deeper."" ""Have I failed you?"" ""No."" ""Will I ever understand what this has been about?"" ""Think deeper."" Deeper. Deeper. Deeper! We were heading slowly outwards, towards the creative horizon of our ring shaped world. Carla's personal routines had shifted over time so that she seemed to run in harmony with the needs of the vessel, sleeping by day while it was charging, and flying short hops in darkness at high altitude from midnight until dawn, when first light might reveal a fresh place for us to set down. I had grown used to her moods now and detected a pattern, a purpose in her behaviour. We set down one morning within sight of the greenish tinted clouds that formed the barrier between us and the creative horizon. Carla chose water as usual, an attractive lakeside landing site with forests and a collection of surrounding mountains. She set the vessel to charge and then took me with her as she climbed a peak in the near distance. The climb occupied a few hours and this wearied her somewhat, so she sat down upon the domed summit and seemed to gaze out at our future. I knew then that it would happen that same night. We were going up to the edge. And this time we were going to punch clean through it. I left her on the mountain-top, tore my eyes away from the TV screen and with a struggle, resurfaced in my own reality. I went outside then into my little back garden and sat down, amazed to find that it was late evening, for by now I had lost all track of time. I gazed out at the meadows, kissed by gold beneath the setting sun. There was so much colour in the world, the real world, so much detail, so much beauty, and I wondered what had caused me to reject it all in favour of an inward landscape, a landscape of pure imagination. Here I was, growing old and alone, and with very little idea of what the real world was about. It was too late to begin trying to understand any of it now, yet the world I had created inside my head was about to disintegrate into a hundred gigabytes of garbled noughts and ones. If that happened, I would have nothing. My whole life would have been for nothing and I would die alone, entirely anonymous in this little terraced house, in the middle of an obscure English town, on the very edge of nowhere. I lit candles in the front room around eleven o'clock. Carla was awake by then and eating supper. She had good energy levels, but her emotional state was depressed on account of an higher stress index. She was afraid. I tried to call her into the divination room, thinking it might be my last chance to talk to her, but she ignored me and I noted that her stress levels rose a little further each time I rang the bell. Better just let her get on with it then, I thought. We left the encampment on the stroke of midnight, flew high in the inky darkness to make sure we were above the tallest of the mountain ranges, and then we flew out. There was nothing to see, just a black screen with dim foreground details - the back of Carla's head, some dials reading out velocity and heading, others reading fuel. Everything was normal. We'd be at the frontier by dawn. I could not leave her, so I sat, curled up on the sofa and covered myself with a blanket while the vessel took us. When the dawn finally came, we emerged into a green swirling mist and she did not pause, but punched straight through, emerging into darkness and the infinite void. Except, ahead of us there was curious point of light,… Carla did not respond to it. The vessel continued on the course she had set hours ago. We no longer required thrusters here because of the absence of gravity effects, yet thrusters remained on full. Carla was tired and hungry after a night of flying, but she made no moves to refresh herself. Her body states were dropping. She was dying,… the ship was dying. But there was a light, and we were heading off, we were going to miss it! Then, slowly, she seemed to become aware of it. We changed course and began to close on the object. It puzzled me, naturally, for there was nothing out here that I was aware of, nothing I had coded, unless I'd set up a lamp in error, aeons ago and forgotten about it. But as we closed, the spot of light became a disc, green and textured. This was more than curious - it was unnerving. Meanwhile, the craft hurtled on, draining energy. It was a full hour before I realised what we were looking at. It was the centre of our world. Everything that had been eaten away at the core was growing out here. In making a leap beyond our future, we had reconnected most unexpectedly, with our past, with everything I thought we had lost! The sun shone over Central Domain as Carla picked out the landing site and set us down. She was weary, moving slowly and erratically as she made for her rooms. She showered, climbed into bed, then slept. While her body recovered, I used the roaming camera routine to check the place out. It was all perfectly stable, at least for now. But I guessed the code was looping. It had developed an iterative pattern, a period-two steady state in which the past grew like a bubble in a place beyond our future. It might take five, ten, or even twenty years but we would make that journey again, and again and again, each time arriving back in the past. The thought horrified me. I made my way outside, to the real world where dawn was now breaking into a thin, watery light. As I sat down upon the bench I felt the dampness soaking through the seat of my trousers, reconnecting me, so to speak, with the sensation of my former reality. But it meant nothing. Indeed at that moment, nothing meant anything any more! I knew the computer would be dialling up its usual daily connection. It would take its page of news from the BBC, convert it to code and use it as a seed for the landscape generator. The new landscape would be added to the landscape at the frontier of a future that was now behind us, a future we would never see, never experience. Indeed it seemed our only future was an infinite regression of past lives, an endless journey, ever deeper - iteration after iteration.Was that the answer to a lifetime's enquiry then? Everything I had done, I was destined to do over and over again. That was not an answer. That was the punchline to bad a joke! Returning indoors I was surprised to find Carla waiting in the divination room. It was normal for her to wander in from time to time, but I had never found her sitting at the table before. She was drumming her fingers and pursing her lips in that characteristic way, and in my imagination it struck me that she looked like she wanted to talk. ""Is everything all right, Carla?"" She lifted the cone to reveal the cloudy pearl. ""Uncertain. Think deeper."" That was no help, I thought. I was too tired to think it through,… to think any deeper now. Either things were all right or they were not. Except I noticed the pearl had changed and at its core there now lay a bright speck of light that illuminated her features, lending her an air of moody intensity I had not seen before. It looked rather like how Central Domain had appeared from the void between past and future. But we were sitting in Central Domain, reliving already a past life, so might the light have been our earlier expanding future? The one we had left behind? ""What are you trying to say? That our future is centred at the point of uncertainty."" ""Yes."" ""That it isn't lost to us?"" ""No."" I thought about his for a while. ""As we journey deeper through each iteration of our past, our experience of it differs, depending on how the future evolves?"" ""Yes."" ""And the future evolves in a way that depends on our experience, like how a reading of the news shapes the creative horizon, at the centre of the grey pearl?"" ""Yes."" ""Past and future. Each dependant on the other, at the point of uncertainty?"" ""Yes."" That was my answer! I wondered why I had not seen it before. Nothing that we do in life is pointless. We can run a country, or we can while away the years in the isolation of our little houses, reading books or watching TV. In the great scheme of things it's all the same and if we make a mess of our lives this time around, it's okay. We have a chance to do it differently, next time. The future is uncertain, like the decay of a radioactive isotope. But every time we make a choice, we shape the way that things unfold. The way we act, the things we say and do, all shape and colour a landscape that is invisible to us, but one which none the less affects our lives at that mysterious point between the atoms, the point where things happen without an apparent cause, things that never-the-less control the shape of the universe and everything in it. We cannot journey into the future, because the future does not exist. A soon as it is born, it becomes the past. The future is a barrier that cannot be breached in any meaningful sense because beyond it lies only a timeless void. But it is a barrier that can be transcended - all you need is a guide. Carla! She is the thread that links all the iterations of my past. For now, she lives on in her code, for even though the purpose of that code has been revealed to me, I have not the heart to let her go. We still talk from time to time, but everything is clear now and I observe her actions out of habit, and the comfort that comes from having her around, when no other human being takes an interest in me any more. To those who come after me, to find her acting out her role on my TV screen, and puzzle over the miles of code that underpins the things she does, perhaps these words will go some way to explaining what it is that she's about. I sleep a lot these days, which is not what I expected of my old age, and the nights have become like dark velvet canvasses on which are painted a succession of vast dreams. Sometimes I dream of the past lives I imagine I have yet to live, when I eventually transcend the future of this particular reality, a reality that is becoming progressively more blurred around the edges, so that sometimes I'm not sure where the dream ends and reality begins. There is one recurring dream I seem to settle upon more and more. It is the September of 1982 as it once was, and as it will be again. But this time I am reading a newspaper on a train. There is a full page advert for a Sinclair Spectrum computer. I am ignorant of such things, but curious,… Eventually, I lower my paper to gaze out of the window but am distracted by the reflection of a woman. As I look, her reflection smiles directly back at me. She seems familiar in some way and as she sits there, she regards me with a fascination that is at the same time unnerving yet also comforting in its intensity. I look around to view this lovely apparition in the flesh, but find the carriage otherwise unoccupied. Then I realise the seat she occupies is actually my own. I am staring at a reflection of myself. And the man I was, is now but a figment gnawing at the imagination of this life, the life that now expresses itself through the woman once known to me as the enigma - ",candidate00005
10,00001,candidate00006,"The last few words on the page burned like fever. The sculptor read them again and again until they blurred into insensibility. He let the book fall to the floor, and left it where it fell, the soft flapping of closing pages like a balm to his mind, the sudden loss of stimulus a cold compress over his hot eyes. He rubbed them until he saw stars and spoke those last few words out loud. In doing so, he not only confirmed to himself that it could be done, he knew instantly the way to do it. It would not be enough to build the thing of clay alone. He knew that. He had read the lore, of course, had in fact taken much of it with a pinch of salt, but much had touched something in him, something that bypassed his blinding grief. It had to do with hope and belief. It had to do with the fact that so much truth was hidden within the myth, so much that had to be true. It was this he clung to, a raft hopelessly battered upon a sea of nonsense. And then he had found the book. Called simply Earth, Risen it was written anonymously in flowing script onto dark parchment-like paper, in a mixture of Hebrew and English. It was this book that had finally convinced him that it could be done. Are you sure you want to know? the bookseller had asked him. There are some things a man should not be party to, and I believe with all my heart that this is one of them. But the bookseller was as driven by money as anyone else, and he had accepted the payment graciously, holding the sculptor’s gaze for perhaps longer than necessary. And so the book had been bought and devoured in the way important books so often are. The book had such a simplicity to it that he knew at once it was genuine. So much of the lore he had studied had been hyperbole, covering up lies and misrepresented fact with drama and shocking revelation. Not so this book. It was, in essence, an instruction manual, a description of the how and why of it. He bent now to retrieve the slim volume, and turned immediately to the last page. ‘… and so with truth, and with their own vitality, or substantial part of it, they will live. And when truth dies, as it eventually must, it will be the end of them, and they cannot revive… ’ And then that last line, as with the bookseller, holding his gaze just that little bit longer than he would have liked. ‘… be aware of what you do. Wrath, like love, has to be earned. Be determined which one you truly seek. Because all is possible, and all is truth… ’ The sculptor stood and the candles set all about him danced as he moved. A soft wind blew about his feet, sending dust motes into frenzied choreography. He poured a large glass of wine, took half of it in one swallow, and set the glass down on a long low bench that flanked one side of the room. In the centre of the room lay a table, high and sturdy. Next to this was a box, an old tea chest, rough hewn planks making up its walls, a hinged lid open to the floor. He reached into the chest, grabbed the neck of the sack within and hefted the load onto the table. A muted clunk broke the silence, and pale dust sifted through the open weave of the sacking. He opened the sack and one by one, lifted out the contents, arranging them roughly, discarding the sack when he was done. The assortment of bones on the table sent a cold shiver through him. They were small and dull and off-white. Dried sinew and tiny shreds of black flesh clung to some of the larger ones; the femur and skull, a shoulder blade. He had bagged hand and foot bones so as to keep them together, and released them now in a clattering pile like druids’ rune stones, beginning to arrange the tableau as if it were nothing more than a jigsaw puzzle. He had once studied anatomy and bone structure and human physiology for his sculptures. It was this knowledge he used now to reassemble the skeleton. Some bones were missing – a rib here, vertebra there, lower jaw hopelessly crushed when his shovel had broken through the rotted coffin lid – but it was only a matter of hours before he had something on his table that he recognised. It was an almost complete child’s skeleton. He took a battery-powered drill and fitted the smallest bit he could find. It looked no thicker than a toothpick. With whining monotony, sending tiny puffs of foul smelling blue smoke into the air, he set about drilling holes into the ends of each and every bone. He was fastidious, clamping each in steady fingers, blowing gently to send the smoke spiralling away from his eyes. A faint burning smell began to surround him, and he worked on. The bones in the feet were drilled now, and he moved onto the hand, and vertebrae. He used a slightly larger bit to drill the leg and arm bones, and the complex machinery of shoulder blade and ribs and collar bone. The rib cage was almost completely intact, apart from the missing rib, and he set this down on the floor as he worked. As each hour passed, tiny drifts of browning bone dust appeared at the ends of each cluster of bones. His excitement grew as each bone was holed, and he began to relish the sweet burning aroma as drill met bone. The sound became the soundtrack to his work, and when he had finished, the last vertebra drilled and placed back with its brothers, he stood back from the table, unaware that the drill was whining redundantly in his hand. He stayed that way, eyes scanning the skeleton over and over to spot any missed bones, until the battery died and the drill fell silent. He dropped it and kicked it absently away from him. From under the bench, in between sips of steadying wine, he sorted through a jumble of boxes and settled on two. The first contained wire. Yards and yards of hair thin silver wire, wrapped fastidiously with strands of spider silk, so that they shimmered like dull moonlight. It had taken months of painstaking and ultimately painful work to collect the silk from his battery of captive spiders. It had to be spider silk. This was one piece of lore that he truly believed, and the book was specific about it. The second contained a lump of wet clay about the size of a football. It was this he brought to the table now, along with a book detailing human anatomy. His skilled fingers worked quickly to separate a piece of clay and draw it into a rough cylinder, about an inch thick and eight long. With it, in between long consultations with the diagrams in his anatomy book, he fashioned a rough flattened semi circle. He drew each end into a paddle about twice the width of the rest. He moulded the whole into a rounded V, and set it next to the skull for sizing. With further modifications and trimming of excess clay, he fitted the piece exactly to the skull. He had made a jawbone. Satisfied, he removed more clay from its box and set about creating a rib, the missing vertebra. Soon, for he was an accomplished sculptor, he was satisfied. He removed the clay pieces carefully, and walked with them over to his kiln in the far corner. His hands were stained with the clay, calloused and sore from hours of painstaking drilling. He placed the pieces into the kiln, watching for a moment as the haze of fire shimmered around them. The smell of hot clay surrounded him. He washed his hands, and changed clothes, throwing the clay-streaked shirt and jeans into an uncomfortable heap next to the kiln. He allowed himself a short sleep. Hours later, the pieces fired and cooled, he sanded their jagged edges and drilled their ends. They fitted into place perfectly, as he knew they would, and a short frisson of excitement ran through him. The skeleton was complete. He began to thread the silk-wrapped silver wire through each and every holed bone. He snipped each piece to size and loosely twisted their ends together. The purpose of the wire was not for strength. It was not to hold the skeleton together, although he hoped the silk wrapped wire could bear the skeleton’s weight for a short time. Rather it was a symbol of completion; a tying together of spirit and bone, locking the loose pieces so that they might know they belong together, and behave accordingly. As sweat ran through the mask of dried clay on his face, his tears joined it, tiny tributaries swelling like a river in a cracked river bed. He wiped the moisture away, smearing the clay like claw marks under his eyes and across his cheeks, red ochre where his finger tips had cracked and added their own moisture. When the final wires between skull and clay jawbone were secured, he moved a second table into place alongside the first. On this he slapped down great chunks of wet clay, relishing the earthy smell, the living quality of the mineral. Fresh spatters of brown water coated him. He fashioned a rough silhouette of a human body, arms and legs and torso about three times their natural width. He pressed a large disc into place where the head should be. He offered up a silent prayer and slipped his hands under the skeleton, one at the knees and the other under the fragile puzzle of vertebrae below the skull. He hefted the wired bones off the table, and had a moments panic when the head lolled comically backwards and the legs clattered towards the floor. The wires held, however, and, its feet kicking in the air, he transferred the skeleton to the second table, laying it lovingly onto the clay silhouette, as a father might lay a sleeping child into bed. Next he filled a large bucket with water and set it next to the skeleton. Immersing his hands in the blessedly cool water, he let them sit there for a while, absently rubbing fingertip against fingertip, scrubbing the blood and grime away. OK, he said softly, and the words echoed around the dusty room. He removed his hands from the bucket and, still dripping, set them about their work bringing the soft clay silhouette up and around the collection of bones. The hollows in the rib cage and between leg and arm bones, he filled with rough blocks of clay. Hours he spent kneading and moulding and knitting edges, filling gaps, adding here, taking away there. He gently turned the body over, and began to work on the back, cleverly shaping the muscles in the back and neck, rounding the clay at the back of the skull, remembering the tiny flat spot just above the nape that he loved. Turning again, he set the body down, heavy now, its heft just right, the still wet clay falling as it should, legs turning slightly out, hands resting palm up. He worked on them now, separating fingers, moulding knuckles and joints, carving delicate lines and creases. Toe and fingernails were shaped, the minute curls of excess clay from his knife falling around his feet. The body he roughed into shape, content to have the idea of it just right, but the detail he forewent in favour of the tiny outfit of clothes hanging from the door. These he would dress the body in once dry. At last he could do no more, and sat back heavily, the table and its body lying at face height. He gasped at its likeness, despite the blank face. He ran a hand across its chest, cupped the narrow chin, and with a fingernail, described a rough mouth, and position of the eyes. He teased a rough pyramid of clay from the middle of the face and shaped absently into its nose. He could do no more and fell back, exhausted. From his jeans pocket he drew a picture. Its edges were torn and crumpled but the face staring from it was crisp and clear. His boy. He slept where he had fallen, the clay on his hands drying to pale ochre dust, the body above him hardening slightly in the dry air. He dreamt no dreams save for the face of the boy, and the sound of screaming. It seemed when he woke that he had been gripped by fever anew. He rose and almost instantly started his work, as early morning arrived without acknowledgement. With an array of shaping and cutting tools, he set about the body’s face. With memory alone he teased and shaped and moulded. The nose that he had roughed out the night before became exact, the small bump on its bridge so lifelike he bent to kiss it as he had so many years before. He worked tirelessly, cupping the shape of cheeks with his moistened palms, creating tiny flaps of clay that he pressed into place over eyes that stared into his with uncanny reason. He went as far as to scratch tiny lines at the corner of the eyes, extracting signs of life almost absently. The tiny full mouth; pointed chin with its smooth dimple; high, full forehead. All these features became reality in his hands. With strands of clay rolled into straw thicknesses, he began layering the dome of skull with hair, each layer subjected to a barber’s scrutiny to ensure that the strands lay just right. He created the flick of fringe that half covered one eye, and turning the body carefully, let the longer strands at the back just reach to the body’s shoulders. He looked at the face, and with a calculated flick, opened the mouth like a wound; remoulded the lips and added the impression of teeth within. Stepping back from the visage, he let out a coughing cry, hands covering the lower half of his own face, muting his shock. He reached to remould the ear lobes, but let the knife fall, content. It was perfect. His son lay on the table before him, androgynous from the neck down, but utterly right and beautiful above. The sculptor spoke his name over and over, and his sobbing words grew slowly quieter, and night fell once more. As the sun burned away a ground mist, and a sweet smelling breeze blew in through the recently opened door, he dressed the figure quickly, allowing the soft folds of cloth to mask any imperfections in the moulding of the body. He had slept well, and changed into clean jeans and a shirt. He rescued the book from the floor and smoothed the pages. Almost subliminal in their placing, the symbols he had searched for were in the middle of the book, scratched with faded ink into one margin; one truth, one death. To mark his son with the first would bring life. The second would end it. He had practiced their curling form over and over, until he could draw them in his sleep. He swallowed the dregs of his third coffee that morning and held his shaking hands up to his face. With a huge effort, he willed them to calm, and they did. The father became the sculptor then, all thoughts erased except for that of rendering the symbols perfectly. He turned once more to his clay son, smoothed the hair as if it were living, feeling and hearing the soft rasp of dry clay under his fingertips. It wasn’t until he saw the first drop of moisture on the face, sinking like rain on a cracked river bed, that he realised he was crying. He selected a knife from his tools, and laid an elbow next to the face, cupping the hand holding the knife with his other. He breathed deeply and held it. When all sound had ceased, when all he could sense was the slight pressure and throb of blood in his ears, he lowered the knife to the forehead and watched, as if he were a mere observer, as the tip scratched into the clay. ΧΩη Truth. The symbols came easily. Indeed, they seemed to form themselves, the knife cutting into the clay like it was fresh and soft. Tiny parings muddied the edges, and he blew on these absently. It was done. The last thing was to feed them. His blood was the only choice, obviously, and so he used the same knife, heedless to the clay-soiled tip, to part his skin on the tip of his thumb. Seconds passed until blood welled into the cut, spilling silently. His mind still blank other than thought of his task, he pressed the wound onto the symbol on his son’s forehead. He felt pain then, almost a sucking sensation as the dry clay eagerly sought his fluids. It happened very quickly. A slight hum filled his ears, the sound of electricity perhaps, and he felt a thrumming under his hand, still pressed to his son. He lifted his hand quickly, and stepped back from the body, rigidly upright, eyes wide with shock. He had known it would work, prayed for it, and yet now he was chilled to the bone with fear. A finger curled. The cloth of the figure’s clothes shifted and settled. The sculptor moved nearer, clutching the knife tightly, breath rasping faster and faster, nostrils flared. An eye opened, the sound like one stone scratching across another. Another eye. The perfectly rendered eyes, complete except for colour (why hadn’t he thought to add colour?), turned and moved and rolled in their sockets. They found him suddenly, fixed on him, blinked slowly, and stared. The sculptor let out a cry, fell to his knees, and moaned his son’s name. The body sat up on the table, dried clay falling from it like leaves, as if they had been playing in an autumn garden. The mouth opened, and impossibly, almost silent, but not silent, it breathed. It reached to him, flexing its fingers, working them like it was trying on new gloves. It smacked its lips silently, discovering the configurations of its face, learning movement and sound and form, even as it shifted its bulk to the edge of the table. A further icicle of fear pierced the sculptor’s spine as the boy raised one hand and made a fist. Slowly, exerting utmost control, it extended one finger and pointed to him. daddy? came a scratching question. The body shifted nearer the edge of the table, until gravity took hold. With no knowledge of balance or of the mechanisms needed to stand, the body pitched helplessly onto the floor and lay; a soft mewling sound broke the stillness. The sculptor moved quickly to its side, all fear gone. He moaned the boy’s name over and over, convinced he would find the body hopelessly broken. But whatever magic had brought tragic life to his sculpture, it seemed also to have brought a physical sturdiness, for even as he reached the body, it was pushing itself into a sitting position, limbs and face and body intact. daddy it said again, confident this time, its voice still no more than a scraping whisper. The sculptor reached his hands to cup the boy’s cheeks, chilled anew at the pulsing warmth beneath the clay. He pushed the fear aside, closed his eyes and bent to plant a kiss on the boy’s forehead. If he had expected the kiss to land on soft, pliant skin, perfumed with fresh air and the exertion of play, then the reality could not have come as more of a shock. Gritty powder coated his lips, and he tasted the alkalinity of clay, the earthiness of the boy’s flesh. He moaned again. The boy moaned with him, a helpless wa wa wa wa wa and the sculptor ran his hands across the waving hair, so lifelike to touch, but smelling like the earth it was. He kissed him again, this time knowing the feeling and so relishing it. His son, born again. As he drew closer, folded his arms about the boy, the sounds he was issuing suddenly became clearer. wa wa w … .w… wh… wh why? why? why? why? why? The sculptor sat back, unable to think as the boy repeated his desperate question again and again. In all his planning, years and years of searching, never had he thought that this would be the first question the boy would ask. Tears streamed down his face, and as he reached out, the boy backed off, shedding dust and clay particles as he went, backing up, backing up until he reached a wall. He continued to push with his legs and in doing so, learned the mechanism of standing. The sculptor stood with him, and moved to stand in front of him, imploring the boy with eyes and gestures and words, to come to him, to let himself be held and to be a son again. The boy’s eyes flickered around the room, landing on the sculptor’s face, the table, the chairs, the window, the open door, the open door the open door the open door Before the sculptor could gather his wits, before he had chance to move, the boy pushed roughly past him, knocking him aside, and crashed through the open door, morning sunlight highlighting the contours of his exquisite face. The sculptor let out a shout of fear and confusion, but ultimately he was too late. The boy had gone. Time passed of which the sculptor had no recollection. The air seemed muted and grey, sounds muffled. Indeed solace could only be found in darkness and in such a state of drunkenness that he felt nothing but the burn of cheap wine. Even the hollow pain in his chest seemed diminished. For a time after his creation had fled, he had raged, hurling tools and lumps of sodden clay about the room, erasing any sign of his work, erasing any sign of the loss he had faced twice now. His son. His poor son. Panic fluttered constantly at the edge of his mind, his hands shook, and sounds issued from his ragged throat that bore no resemblance to human noises. What have I done? he cried to the room. My son! He began to piece together anything that might help him find the boy. He read and re-read Earth, Risen, hoping, desperately searching for some nugget he had missed. Where might he have gone? Who may have found him? And all this was affording the sculpture sentient thought. What if it was mindless, nothing more than animated clay? What if there was none of his son left? But the first word from its mouth had been daddy. Surely it must be his son. It must be. He took a drink of wine then, and one followed, and followed. Bottle after bottle was consumed, and the sculptor began to dream that none of it had happened. Darkness turned darker, sound failed him, and he lost his fight with sleep. But even sleep could not protect him from images of moving clay, great lumpen faces with stretched maws, grasping hands, tearing, pulling. And always the questions. why why why why why why why why why? He woke screaming. ‘… be aware of what you do. Wrath, like love, has to be earned. Be determined which one you truly seek. Because all is possible, and all is truth… ’ Was it love he wanted, truly? Or was he really seeking the boy’s wrath? He closed his eyes and saw the boy’s face, heard screaming, heard the breaking of glass and shrieking of tyres. He lived the moment that his son died, over and over. Died because of him. Because he took the boy from his mother in a drunken rage, drove in a drunken rage, killed his son in a drunken rage. He read the words again. In a second he knew. Knew everything. He knew somewhere in the back of his mind that he could never have lived with the sculpture like he would have his own son. And so love was not his aim here. That left only wrath, and as soon as he thought it, he felt a great weight lift. At last he felt the burden of his son’s death lift from his shoulders, and he knew where to find him. The door stood open still, flecks of clay marring the surface. It was a short walk to the bridge. The place where he had driven from the road, plunged the car into the icy river. To this day, he could not have said it was truly an accident or truly deliberate. But it happened, and as the black water flooded the car, and he struggled with his own seatbelt, he heard his son screaming and screaming. Until water smothered them both. He lived. His son did not, and now as he approached the small bridge, the replacement railing that his car had destroyed still a shade lighter than the original all these years on, he saw the figure sitting on the wooden boards. It had lost its clothes, and he saw again how unfinished its body was. A mere suggestion of form, and yet hands as perfect as in life covered a face that he knew better than his own. It sobbed as it sat there, whispers of pain and sadness reaching the sculptor’s ears. He bent to it and rested a hand on its shoulders. It reacted violently, snatching itself away, its mouth open in a silent scream, a suggestion of fear in its eyes. It locked gaze with him, and in a heart lifting moment, its mouth curled in a smile. Faint and stiff as the clay had dried but it was there. daddy it said. my son, he replied holding his arms out wide. It came to him then, and wrapped its arms around him. He sobbed and sobbed, tears dappling the dome of its head, running along the cleft of its parted hair. He dropped to his knees, knowing what was to come, and yet feeling nothing but the joy of finding his boy. He smiled and kissed the face lightly. He picked the boy up, rested his weight on the railings above the roiling water. It was as black as he remembered. Reaching a hand up to the creature’s forehead, he whispered two words onto its tiny ear. i’m sorry Its grip on him tightened and its eyes widened slightly as it realised somehow what he was about to do. He rested a thumb on its forehead, and with a scratching stroke, scraped out the first symbol drawn there. He remembered the text from Earth, Risen, remembered the symbols perfectly. In scratching out that first, he effectively turned truth, ΧΩη into death, Ωη The transformation happened quickly. Suddenly the sculpture was just that. In its eyes, there was nothing. He looked down into its face and saw not life there, but only the numerous faint marks of the tools that he had used to render it. The body was a dead weight, and its arms a hardened clay sculpture around his middle. As it dropped and he had neither the strength nor the desire to stop its fall, it took him with it. The water hit him with a slap of iciness, and he didn’t hesitate to finish what he had started. His first breath was air and foamy water and he coughed it out reflexively. His next, and the next, and the next, were not air. It was black freezing water he was filling his lungs with now, and he welcomed it. His son would have breathed the same water, would have felt the same panic, the pain in his chest that was fading remarkably quickly now he had resigned to it. As darkness came over him, he felt the clay sculpture begin to disintegrate in his hands. Faintly he felt the scrape of its hands as it released him into the water, and he reached with the last of his strength and wit to catch hold of its face. Clay crumbled under his touch, and he brought his hand back and kissed the residues. The action of the water gave the face a lopsided grin, one he remembered so well, and his tears added infinitesimal volume to the raging river. The pain was gone. His sight and hearing were gone. There was no feeling as the current tore him this way and that, scraped his trailing legs along the river bed, tore into his flesh with loose rock and branch. There was just the feeling of floating and the heart-bursting joy as a small hand took his and a whisper of love from a small voice echoed in his ear. He was content to lose his life for this; as if he had sculpted love from the very bones of despair and guilt. To have that hand in his, and those whispers of love and forgiveness in his ear. To have those, without life? It was enough. ",candidate00006
11,00002,candidate00006,"Sol bought the box from a local antique shop, on a rainy Saturday morning. He paid twenty-five pounds and thought he had got a real bargain. The dealer had shown him the box, marvelled at its intricate carved sides; the swirls and eddies of wood, some of them looking almost like faces, teased from the block by an obviously immensely talented woodworker. He ooh-ed and ahh-ed at the burnished brass corners and mother of pearl inlays, while Sol glanced from tables to chairs, from mirrors and broken picture frames to a particularly stained and unattractive watercolour, yawning. He bought the box because he though it was just the thing to sit his bedside lamp on. The dealer told him it was 18th Century. He wondered aloud at paying only twenty-five pounds for anything over 200 years old. The dealer shrugged and dropped the price to twenty. The traffic was snarled in the winding streets all the way back to his house, and it took more than twice the usual 15 minutes to drive from the centre of town. The rain continued to pour and steam built up on the insides of the car windows, until Sol was forced to wind down the window and drive with his head lolling out like a particularly wet and wretched dog. The box sat across the back seat, unperturbed by the visibility problems. By the time he reached his house, the rain had reached tropical ferocity. It seemed to bounce three feet off the pavement and as he rushed to the front door, key in hand, head bowed, a small river tore down his path, the debris of months of garden neglect collecting across his shoes. He opened the front door slower than he would have liked, key knocking the brass plate that covered the keyhole several times before finding the hole, and almost fell through the door in his haste. He wasn’t a man normally given to introspection, but his cheeks reddened slightly and he glanced over his shoulder in what he hoped was an easy movement, hoping no one had seen his panicked entrance. He pushed the door shut with his foot and leaned against it. It was then that he realised the box still sat on the passenger seat of his car, and that he hadn’t locked the doors. ‘Shit,’ he said. Then he laughed. Anyone willing to steal his car or the box in this weather was welcome to it. He kicked off his shoes, cursing the mess on the hall carpet. Rain fell from his clothes and hair and wet the carpet further, spotting a few pieces of post that had been dropped through the door while he was out. He picked them up, and although three out of the four were obviously junk mail, he shook them dry and placed them next to the telephone. ‘Shit’, he said again. He checked the answering machine for messages, listened to one from his mother and deleted it. He told the machine that he still wasn’t sure when he was going to get married and provide her a grandchild (or maybe two) but he wasn’t going to marry someone his mother had picked, and certainly not someone he was told about via his answering machine. He contemplated unplugging the phone, but decided against it and walked slowly to the kitchen. Putting the kettle on to boil, he grabbed a tea towel from the back of a chair and furiously dried his hair. Five minutes later, sitting in his living room, hair a tangled, damp mess, strong coffee in one hand and a piece of toast in the other, Sol finally relaxed. The rain seemed to slow with his heartbeat and he thought that he would leave the house to lock his car and bring in his recent purchase as soon as his coffee was drunk. He considered switching on his ancient radio, but was increasingly unimpressed by the banality it spat at him these days. He didn’t own a television. He wondered idly whether he was missing anything in his life. The thought remained unresolved. As he set his cup down on one of the old fake leather drink-mats his mother had bought him as a moving in present (the one and only time she had been to the house), the phone shrilled from the hall. He frowned, adopting that slightly paranoid air that comes over people when they hear a phone ringing. For Sol, nine times out of ten, a phone ringing was bad news. ‘Who..?’ he started, mentally counting off a list of the people who he expected it to be. His mother had already rung today. His list ended. The phone stopped abruptly. He picked up the receiver and dialled 1-4-7-1. The call was from a number he didn’t recognise. He frowned more deeply and hesitantly dialled the number. His frown smoothed as he listened and nodded. ‘Ah yes, I see, thanks very much for calling,’ he said as he hung up. It had been the antique dealer. Apparently there was a key for his box and the dealer had found it when cleaning the space the box had taken up in his shop. Sol resolved to drive down and pick it up right then before he had his lunch. The rain had left a clean stripe down the centre of the garden path, mini-drifts of sticks and flower heads left by the flood lining the path. The air had a damp yet optimistic feeling, the sun was warm and the smell of recent rain and wet foliage was one that Sol treasured in his garden. He breathed deeply, his step a little lighter. The traffic had eased and the sun shone fitfully through the remaining cloud cover. Sol had to keep his window open to clear the condensation that always built up inside his car when it rained. His spirits, somehow, were high. He pulled up outside the shop and pressed the switch that set his hazard lights flashing. He ran into the shop and after a frustrating five-minute conversation with the antique dealer, from which he tried numerous times to extract himself, he made it back to his car, key clutched tightly in his left hand, while he juggled his main set of keys with his other. Eventually he managed to grasp the car key and let himself back into the car. For the first time, he noticed the smell. It came from the box, he was sure of that, and he thought it must be the damp condition, bringing out the aroma of the wood. It was not an unpleasant smell, rather like deep green olives and coconut oil mixed with smoke and the dark musty smell of ripe earth. He turned and looked at the box, and saw for the first time how the grain of the wood seemed to glow in the patchy sunlight. He smiled to himself and breathed deeply. He threw the key lightly onto the seat beside him and it seemed to chime as it fell across the upholstery. Sol checked his mirrors and pulled sharply away from the shop. He made it home in ten minutes and after pushing the key deep into his pocket, carried the box carefully up the path, setting it down to rest on the toes of his shoes as he unlocked the front door. He set it down on the couch in his front room, and sat down on the chair opposite. He pulled the key from his pocket and turned it slowly in his hands, relishing the sound it made as it travelled through his calloused fingers, like a distant wind chime. He shut his eyes. Instantly images filled his head. Dark, rent flesh, a butcher’s shop of images with flashing, silver blades, spurting redness and screaming mouths stretched to impossible size in their terror. He thrust himself back against the chair. The key fell from his hand and he at once opened his eyes and emitted a low keening sound from deep in his throat. His eyes flashed wildly. ‘Jesus.’ he said, running a hand full-palmed across his face. He glanced down at the fallen key, gleaming dully in the thick pile of the carpet. A nervous chuckle sounded impossibly loud in the quiet of his house. He forced a laugh, anything to break the silence. The warmth, the quiet, the heaviness of toast and coffee that lay in his belly; he convinced himself it was these things, these normal everyday things that had lulled him into a mid-morning nap, and that his tired brain had concocted the awful nightmare images. He reached for the key, aware of the wind chime sounding in his ears again. He picked it up. The wind chime became a thousand chimes, a hundred thousand; all of them ringing in a wind that he could not feel. He shut his eyes, screwed his face in an attempt to shut out the noise. It was futile, for the sound doubled, then trebled, and he thrust his hands over his ears. The earthy, olive smell of the box wafted to him, and he opened his eyes to look. The box sat where he had left it. Around it, around him, the world had become a mess of nothingness, as if he lived in a watercolour painting and the artist had decided to wash everything out. His living room ran like it was liquid and behind the wallpaper and red brick and mortar was darkness. He moaned involuntarily, a dead sound, a helpless sound, as his world was washed from existence and all that was left was the box. Its dark wood gleamed malevolently, and Sol had presence of mind to question his thought then. It was a box. Boxes don’t do anything, let alone do them malevolently. He forced his hand open and the key fell once again to the carpet. It has left a red impression in his palm, which he stared at. ‘When I look up,’ he said to himself, his voice echoing and distant, ‘my living room will be back where it belongs.’ He looked. It was. And the box stood open. Strange sounds issued from it, distant keenings, howls that beat into the softness of his brain. He covered his ears against the noise, but it penetrated deeper. He stood, and stepped onto the key, which felt warm under his feet. For a fleeting moment he unstopped his ears to pick it up, and discovered that the sounds had ceased. Almost absent-mindedly, he retrieved the key and pocketed it, and turned his attention to the opened box. As he drew nearer, he theorised that the sounds had not stopped, but only that he had become used to them, and now they played a gently lapping tide across his anxiety. His eyes drew closed, dreamlike, and he smiled. His hand reached toward the box and fluttered like a bird in a wind. The noise from the box intensified and Sol opened his eyes to see a swirling mass begin to solidify on the dark interior of the box. The opening to the box itself seemed to have grown and the mass grew with it. He murmured some unintelligible word at the sight of it, and began to reach further inside the confines of the box. The mass grew darker, more real somehow, and flashes of gold light began to appear on the surface. Its shape was not firm however, switching from oval to sphere to star and every shape in between. The noises, now louder and clearly audible as voices (in choir, in jubilation, in terror?), beckoned him in, and even as he tried to thwart the box’s obvious intentions (he had long ago given up any thought to why or how the box was doing what it was doing), he fell forward into the yawning darkness, that impossibly, but absolutely, swallowed him. He had time and faculties enough to wonder at this situation he found himself in and then darkness overtook all. The noises did not abate however, and voices joined voices joined voices until the choir was gargantuan. He felt warm wetness on his cheeks and it could have been tears or blood. By degrees, light filtered into his consciousness and afforded him some knowledge of his surroundings, and allowed his mind to make some sense of things. It seemed he stood on wooden floorboards but it was only as he looked down to confirm this that he felt them under him. His feet were bare, and the slightest movement upon the floor broke open the skin on them, so that he shed tiny rivulets of scarlet onto the warped grain. There was no pain however. Somehow, he accepted all of this, and as he looked skyward (for the room in which he stood was so vast that the ceiling was out of sight completely) he accepted the presence of the seething mass that had drawn him here, swirling and knotting itself into a hundred thousand nightmare configurations. Only now it seemed to have shed the confines of the box into which he had fallen, and was of monstrous size, easily a hundred metres across, with clouds of gray and brown and black ebbing across its surface, held together one minute and the next thrown violently apart by shafts of golden lightning. The sum of this movement was nothing less than terrifying and as Sol stared into its depth, his pained and terrorised voice became one among many that was still the only sound here. As in a daze, he backed slowly away from the mass, but it was so large now that it was forever above him. He sat heavily, and felt the skin on his legs and buttocks splitting, but again there was no pain. A warm wetness spread across his thighs and he tore his gaze away from the sight above him to look. The mass gave off a light, but it was a sickly glow, turning everything in its scope a dirty gray. The stain on his jeans was black and he knew it was blood. He touched a finger to it. As his fevered mind allowed him to grasp at some invented logic to his present state, he began to smell the deep green olive and earth smell that had signalled the start of this episode. He imagined that he had fallen and hit his head on the rim of the box perhaps, and was dreaming this fugue state. The feeling of panic and loss was slowly leaving him, as the choir of voices did. A calm washed across him, such as he had never felt. He clutched his hands together and moved slowly in a circle to better assess his position. The swirling mass of energy above his head now occupied every horizon. He could still see the grey, grainy floorboards beneath his feet, but of ceiling and walls there was no sign. He had the impression that he could walk for a lifetime with the seething nightmare for a constant companion and never reach the room’s (if that is what he was in) extremes. The thought chilled him and elated him in equal measure. He thought he had been tricked into thinking that silence pervaded, for he began to hear cracklings and hissing sighs all around. They surely came from above him, the golden lightning flashes punctuating the sound until it achieved a measure of rhythm. He understood suddenly that they were the sounds of it growing. It struck him then how quickly he had shed the confines of rational thought. How long ago it seemed that he had drunk coffee and run through the rain. He shrugged off this sad and ultimately destructive train of though and began to walk. It seemed he walked for days. His feet bled, and on occasion when the pain became too intense he stopped and sat. The skin on his legs was healing, and no new blood had soaked his jeans. He was thankful for that. Always, the seething mass accompanied him, its roiling voice stopping Sol from thinking too hard about his situation. Then all sound ceased and the loss in his head was almost painful. ‘Hello,’ said a voice. Sol’s fear prevented him from anything but a barked reply. It seemed so long since he had heard any spoken word other than the cacophony of screams from above. He turned to face the speaker. A small creature stood there, more simian than human, but with a small upturned mouth, bristling with silver whiskers and a blue cap slung low over his brow that made him look like a fisherman. He wore dirty dungarees and with nothing on his feet, Sol could see that fur grew to the ends of his toes. A whip of a tail curled around one ankle, its end twitching. ‘Who are you?’ Sol managed at length. His voice was hoarse, and he wondered whether his voice had joined the thousands for his entire walk. ‘Danté,’ said the creature. He stood as if waiting on a reply, and when Sol gave none, he coughed and the whiptail switched ankles. Sol could have sworn he heard its passage through the hot air, even above the noise. ‘Wanna get you away from that,’ the creature said, motioning upwards with a tilt of its head. ‘Never seen it so big.’ He beckoned and ran in the opposite direction, his gait light and altogether non-human. Sol figured he had no choice but to follow. ‘It’s not for you, y’see,’ Danté shouted over his shoulder as they ran. Sol kept pace, just, and soon felt his lungs burning. He ignored the cryptic comment, concentrated on matching the creature’s speed. Soon they came to a door set into one wall. Sol had not seen it coming, and indeed, it only seemed to waver into existence once Danté came close to it. ‘It’s protected by a shimmer,’ he explained. ‘Keeps me from going up there. Without it, you’d never find home, and run forever in this place.’ Sol noticed the creature never looked at the mass, which was still in every corner of his vision. Golden rods of lightning suddenly arced downwards, striking the floor and leaving scorched debris in its wake. Sol was sure that it had struck where they had been standing. He shuddered and followed the creature through the door. It slammed behind him, and as he heard and felt the shimmer hide them from existence, so he felt the pull and the noise of the mass disappear. A sickly feeling doubled him over, and he squeezed his eyes shut against it. He rubbed his ears and his eyes, unwilling to open them and admit to anything that he saw here. ‘We call it the Wrath,’ Danté explained. ‘We?’ asked Sol. ‘We. As in us. As in the guards of this place. Guards o’ the Wrath.’ It made no sense to Sol, even as a dream. He shook his head. ‘What do you guard? That thing?’ he gestured to the door. ‘God, no. The Wrath does at it pleases. As he pleases.’ He didn’t furnish Sol with a name. ‘We guard this place for when people like you come here. Wrong people, innocent people.’ His tone had taken on a dark edge, and Sol went cold at the word innocent. Was something about to happen? Something more? Something that shouldn’t happen to him, but that would happen because he was innocent and had no way of stopping it? ‘Don’t worry,’ Danté quickly said. ‘You’ll be okay now ole Danté’s got you. What is your name, anyway?’ ‘Sol.’ ‘Solomon?’ the creature asked. ‘Solomon and Danté!’ He nodded his approval, but Sol wasn’t sure of what he approved. ‘Just Sol.’ Danté raised his hands as if in supplication, and wrapped his tail a little tighter around his ankle. ‘Okay, okay. No offence meant.’ ‘Sorry,’ said Sol. ‘It’s just that…’ He let the sentence trail. ‘I know, I know. The Wrath can do that to an innocent.’ ‘What in hell is it?’ Sol asked, softening to this creature. ‘Exactly that. Hell. Or at least his representation of it. I don’t suppose Hell as such exists anymore, what with the state of things Earthly. There’d be no separating it, eh?’ He laughed at his little joke. Sol remained quiet. ‘Anyway, it is a magnet, if you like, for all of,’ at this he gestured upwards, ‘you know. You lot. Wrongdoers, evil-bringers, death-deliverers. What I like to call Society. There’s a few innocents, like you, that don’t belong here, never will, but for most, this is it.’ ‘Who is he?’ Sol asked. ‘All in good time, all in good time. Fancy a drink?’ ‘I’m not sure I understand all this. I was just…I…can’t remember what I was doing before this, actually. I don’t understand.’ Sol looked round for a chair, and finding none, bent and sat cross-legged on the floor. Danté joined him, although he had considerably less far to bend. The creature huffed. ‘Look, it’s like this.’ Absurdly, he found himself settling to listen. ‘Society sins. It’s the way it is. Year on year, decade upon decade, Society will find new and unimaginably unpleasant ways to commit sin. Now don’t get me wrong. I’m no judgement. God knows, I sin as much as the rest, but things are…different down here. Nowhere for us to go, you see? We’re here no matter what. And Society’s sinners? They come here. The Wrath takes ‘em.’ Sol swallowed and the click was audible. ‘Here, let me get you that drink.’ The creature stood and hopped lightly to a cabinet set deep into one corner, bringing two cups and a dark green fermenting brew that smelled to Sol like the bottom of a compost heap. He drank however, still content that he was dreaming all this. The brew was, if nothing else, palatable, and he smiled. ‘Thanks.’ ‘I know all this is hard, but we need to get you back up there before she decides she can’t wait no longer.’ ‘She?’ asked Sol. ‘Sorry,’ the creature blushed. ‘We reckon the Wrath is female. Don’t know why.’ ‘Wrath. Of course.’ Sol said, laughing softly. He sipped more of the green brew that, against his better judgement, was beginning to taste quite pleasant. ‘Go on.’ ‘Anyway, she collects things. We all collect things, don’t we, but she likes to collect people. Souls, if you like.’ ‘Sinners,’ Sol interrupted. ‘Now you’re getting it!’ Danté smiled. ‘Exactly. Sinners.’ ‘So where do I fit into all this?’ Sol asked. ‘I haven’t sinned, not like she thinks.’ Something else was bothering Sol, as if the current situation wasn’t worrisome enough. ‘I know loads of people who you’d call sinners. Adulterers, thieves. All that.’ ‘You mix with some nice people, Sol, I must say.’ ‘Well, I don’t know them as such, but my point is, I know of them. Why are they not here? And speaking of which, where are all these sinners? What does she do with them?’ Danté looked to the floor. ‘Here’s the thing, Sol. For people to be collected, they have to be..er..’ He paused. ‘Don’t tell me. Dead.’ ‘Yes. Dead. Then their souls have two paths. One is here. You can imagine the other. Anyway, what I am trying to tell you is that for you to be brought here, you will have to have died up there.’ He used his tail to gesture upwards, its whistling tip close to Sol’s face. ‘Did you?’ ‘How the hell should I know?’ Sol shouted. He began to stand, but something in Danté’s eyes stayed his movement. ‘Keep your voice down! The shimmer is only good for so long. We do not want her to find us down here. Are you sure you didn’t die up there?’ The questioning seemed so ludicrous that Sol found himself answering without thinking. ‘I don’t think so. I remember buying a chest, a box for my bedside lamp. Then I remember opening it, I remember falling towards it, and then. Nothing.’ ‘Right.’ ‘Right what?’ ‘Just right.’ ‘What the Hell’s that supposed to mean?’ ‘Shh, I’m thinking. I suppose that….’ Danté stopped and ran a clawed hand across his stiff whiskers. ‘There are portals here, portals to and from this place. Only we know of them, and usually, only we use them.’ ‘You’ve been up?’ Sol pointed towards the ceiling. ‘Once. Awful place. Anyway, I suppose you may have fallen into one. She does set them in the strangest places. They are to capture those she considers the foulest of the foul. Some that she cannot wait for.’ ‘So why me? And how did I manage to get here without….her finding me? ‘Well, it could be that she didn’t know you were here. What happened, exactly, with your box?’ ‘It opened and I fell in. I heard voices, I remember that, and I had a key.’ He felt in his pocket and the key was still there. He said so. ‘Seems important to keep hold of that, I reckon,’ said Danté. ‘Anyway, you got in through a portal, and we need to get you out. He may be looking for you now.’ ‘I thought you said it was female?’ ‘The Wrath is female. Him who owns it is a man. Or was a man once. Something like that. Although as time goes on, I don’t know who owns who anymore.’ ‘So he is the Devil or something?’ Danté laughed. ‘You humans, always so quick to put a name to something. He’s not the Devil or anything like it. He’s gone past being anything like that. More like he’s just a rumour now. Whatever the case, she is his pet, you could say. I don’t reckon he’s had a hand in her existence for as long as I’ve been here, at least.’ ‘Then why did you mention him, why did you say ‘the Wrath does as he pleases’ then?’ ‘Habit, I guess. No, the truth is that I don’t know where or who he is. He was human once, they say. They also say that he raised a demon and that the demon took his mortal life in exchange for an immortal one. The only catch being, that existence was down here.’ He gestured towards the door. ‘What a deal, eh? No one knows when he created the Wrath, but they say..’ ‘Hang on a minute,’ Sol interrupted. ‘Who is ‘they’?’ ‘You know. Just they.’ Danté said. Sol nodded, and indicated he was ready for the rest. ‘Anyway, ‘they’ say that the Wrath was created by this immortal man as a way of placating the demon and getting his mortal life back. If he collected enough damned souls, then he reasoned that the demon would give him his life back, and exchange places again. Hasn’t happened yet, as you can see. And hear.’ He pricked his ears towards the ceiling. ‘She’s getting louder, Sol. She must know you are here somewhere. The shimmer is holding her for now. We are safe for a while longer.’ ‘And then?’ Sol asked. Danté shrugged. ‘We run.’ Sol could hear the Wrath now as she roiled and crackled above them. He imagined the dark clouds and golden lightning and configurations that he now knew were the sounds of the Wrath growing. Soon it would not matter that he was no sinner; it would not matter that a shimmer protected them or that Danté was here. Soon enough, the Wrath would get him and he could not be able to escape her. ‘How do we beat her, then?’ he asked. ‘We don’t. We run and we run and we find your portal.’ The first few steps of their escape were easy and quiet, for the Wrath seemed, inexplicably, to have grown quiet during their last words together. Sol began to wonder (he had long ago stopped wondering if he was dreaming) whether he would be safely back home before long. Then a huge, deafening scream filled the void of sound, as if a million insects had made whatever squealing, chitinous, wrenching sounds they make. Sol felt a hot breath on his back as the Wrath turned her murderous attention to them once more, and they were flung off their feet, landing hard on the cracked wooden floor. Sol was momentarily stunned, and he felt a small, clawed hand grasping at his arm. ‘Come on, come on!’ a voice screamed, and he turned to see Danté inches from his face, panic in his eyes, spittle spraying from his whiskered jaws. His lips trembled like those of a jilted lover. They ran. They had to start the journey running in the opposite direction to the one that had brought Sol to Danté’s house. The Wrath now covered every line of sight back the way Sol would have ordinarily gone. He hoped that whatever skewed and deranged physics affected this place, he could find his way back in any direction, as if he were running on a tiny globe. Jags of bitter lightning forked down to meet them, crashing and sparking blue fire off the floor all around them. Danté squealed and leaped high into the air at every crash, and Sol concentrated on pounding his footsteps as hard and as fast as he could. There was no time for conversation, and each knew that to pause would be to die. Sol blessed the green brew that Danté had given him, for far from being tired, he was filled with a strange energy that lit his eyes and turned his feet over and over without effort. He felt almost as if he couldn’t stop even if he had wanted to. Despite this, and despite Danté’s almost constant encouragement, he could feel the heat and the anger of the Wrath gaining on them. He began to whimper, under his breath at first and then louder. ‘…run…run…RUN…RUN….RUNRUNRUNRUNRUN!’ Footsteps pounded in his ears. He tried to fathom their distance as they ran, but the deafening strikes of lightning and bitter ozone that they left beghind soon clouded his mind to anything but running. Suddenly Danté grabbed his hand and pulled him in an almost sickening twist to the left, and his stomach turned and roiled as they passed through another shimmer. He looked around him, almost unable to believe his eyes. A cup, remnants of green fluid stickly coating the rim, sat just where he had left it. ‘But..’he gasped. ‘We’re back. We have just run in a circle!’ The creature seemed unable to breathe. His cheeks were flushed red, and droplets of sweat dripped and splashed off his whiskers. His tail, no longer taut and whip-like, hung softly on the floor, flailing weakly. He shook his head slowly. ‘No. We’re not. It’s another shimmer,’ he explained through gasps of air, stale but infinitely fresher than the ozone-filled atmosphere on the other side of the door. ‘Different location, same destination. We have come far, believe me. I have shimmers all over this place, all leading here.’ Sol sat down hard. ‘Jesus, I’m going mad. It’s the only explanation,’ he said, wiping his forehead with his palm running his hand down the whole of his face. A sharp stinging slap to his cheek drew a loud cry from him. ‘What the hell was that for?’ ‘You are not mad, Sol. This is reality. I will NOT have you put all this down to your madness. I will NOT fail you but I must have complete faith from you. You must believe in this or it will not work. Do you understand me?’ Danté was back to his jittery, rodent-like self, tail twitching, whiskers twitching, fisherman’s cap once more pulled down tight. Sol laughed. He shook his head. ‘Whatever you say, cap’n.’ ‘What kind of answer is that?’ ‘The only one I can give right now, I think. It will have to do.’ ‘So it will, so it will,’ said Danté. ‘So all the shimmers lead here?’ Sol asked. ‘All of mine do, yes. There are thousands all over this place, but all mine lead here. You just have to know which are yours and which aren’t. It gets quite simple, really it does. You always know which house is yours on your street? Which car is yours in the car park? It’s the same here for me. My shimmers are mine and I know them and love them like you love your possessions. Apart from what you see here,’ he paused to sweep around the contents of his room, ‘they are all I’ve got. Think of them as…as stepping stones to wherever you want to go. Trouble is, we could open that door twenty times and be back where we started each time. They don’t work quite so well any more. With any luck we can be a way away next time we open that door. Now up you get, Sol. We need to move, ‘cause you can bet your life she knows we are here and she won’t stop looking.’ Noticing Sol’s downbeat eyes, hitching breath and trembling hands, Danté cheered. ‘Come on! What else would you be doing?’ Sol fixed him with a glance that would have been comical under any other circumstances. Under these, with the Wrath beating and swelling like a gargantuan poison-sac of souls, it wasn’t. He stood and they faced the door. ‘Now, when I say run, you run. Out of the door, and immediately left. Run for your life.’ Danté’s cheery demeanour left him and he hissed the words, tail twitching like a whip about its deadly business. In the end he had to say nothing, for no sooner than the door handle was turned, than Sol was out of it, feet barely touching the floor. Danté followed, slamming the tiny door behind him. It was as if the Wrath was lying in wait. They were instantly pursued, and the giant writhing mass was so close they could smell its bitter, cordite-laced aroma. Sol turned and looked directly into the mass, saw once and for all what the shifting patterns of grey and black on its surface really were. They were faces, hideously stretched and howling madness at him, faces of the people that the Wrath had snatched from life and collected in this cloud. They came and went so fast that the impression was of one single face, deformed and turned inhuman with the horror of it, the horror of their situation. That they had some comprehension, Sol was sure. It turned his bowels to water to watch and he tore his gaze away. Danté had gained some distance from him and his heart quickened. He raced harder to catch up. All the while the Wrath screeched and clattered at him, and now the noise was made all the more desperate, for among the scratching and crackling of the lightning that still struck the floor all about him, he could hear single voices, single words and though all were different, all were the same. Help….me…horror…fear…destroy…me Sol reached out and clasped a hand on Danté’s shoulder. He could feel wiry muscle barely covering tiny bones and a heat that was like fever. He suddenly felt exhilarated beyond anything he had ever felt, and he screeched loudly into the air. It fell silent, such was the clamour that came from the abomination behind him. He concentrated on following Danté’s stamping feet and athlete’s rhythm. When it happened, it happened so quickly that he barely had time to register. Danté turned and shouted something to Sol. Over the noise and heated fear of the Wrath, Sol heard nothing more than muted sounds, snatches of words that were swallowed instantly. ‘Here…must find…shimmer…SOL!’ He heard this last word as Danté turned abruptly, his small hairy hands reaching for Sol’s. Sol reached back, and would have caught them had it not been for a flash of lightning that exploded not five feet to his right. He flinched automatically, and his hands missed their mark. Sickeningly, he saw Danté turn an invisible door handle, and even as Sol slowed and tried to make the turn, the guard disappeared through the door. He saw a flash of shimmering air, like a heat haze and then nothing. For a second he paused, unbelieving. Stupidly he reached a hand into the darkness. Another lightning flash to his right, this one close enough to singe his clothing, snapped him from his daze. Pain flared in his right leg, heat and cold fear mingling through the very marrow of his bones. He ran on, blood leaking slowly from a wound he did not want to see, knowing that to keep going would lose him his escape, but that to stop would lose him his life. He shouted and screamed and clenched his fists tight against his ears. Tears coursed down his cheeks, and a wild look appeared in his eyes. Always, the Wrath bore down on him, its immense size beyond description now. He may as well have tried to outrun the world. He could feel it pulling on him, snatching at him with its unending and relentless army of souls. It thrust images into his head, images that mirrored the flickering blood and death visions he had had so long ago in his living room. He barked a sob, clutched his stomach, so deep did his feeling of loss and pain go. He glanced round wildly now, searching for any sign of Danté, of a door, of anything. There was nothing to see but vast expanses of wooden floorboards, struck black here and there with lightning strikes. He risked one more look over his shoulder, and at the sight of the Wrath, all hate and fear and writhing faces, he screamed. There seemed there was no choice but to run and run and run and wait for the thing, which seemed to have started it’s knotting and un-knotting anew, to take him. So he ran. Days passed, or seemed to. Sometimes the Wrath was distant, like some vast fireball bearing down on him, constant and yet far enough away so as to feel no heat from it. Other times it seemed as though the thing was on him, in him. He could feel the raw energy crackling his hair off his arms; feel the electricity jolt through his teeth, light his eyes with eldritch fire. As he ran, he began to notice more and more of the blackened spots on the floor. He knew they should mean something to him, but the noise and pain of the Wrath prevented him from thinking for more than a few seconds at a time. Then he saw a splash of blood, dried to a crust. He saw a small, clawed footprint in the blood, and more leading from it. More lightning struck the floor, sending bright sparks of blue and gold spiralling into the air. He increased his speed as much as he could, (how, he could never explain) and the noise from the Wrath lessened blessedly for one vital minute. His head emptied and thoughts locked into place like the tumblers of a lock. Suddenly he knew what he had seen. Blackened spots where lightning had struck. But ahead of him. Blood, his blood he was sure, ahead of him. It all meant that he had been past this spot before. And if the blood was from the wound he had received just after Danté had left him, then..? The door Danté had left though must be just…. He was wrenched violently to the side as Danté’s powerful hands grabbed him. They scrabbled and clattered against his skin, tearing it, scratching deep gouges into his arms. His panic, constant since he could remember, further heightened as he thought of running on his own again through this devil’s wasteland. In blind terror, he threw himself towards his saviour, badly twisting a knee as he did so. He thrust his arms out, grasping with his own hands. Mercifully they closed on cloth, and then he saw the leathery end of Danté’s whip-like tail close round his wrist. He saw the glistening heat haze and felt the now familiar sickness as he was pulled through the shimmer and landed hard on the floor of Danté’s room. He was sick, copiously and violently, and through it all he could hear the Wrath screaming in frustration. The voices joined in one long low churning moan. The protection of the shimmer could do nothing to lessen the noise now, and Danté threw a chair against it, followed that with a table and more chairs until there was a small mountain of woodwork piled there. He turned away from the mess on the floor and closed his eyes. He let his mind sink from white to grey to black, wallowing in the relief of unconsciousness. He awoke sometime later to the smell and spitting sizzle of frying bacon. The experience was so alien in this setting that he sat bolt upright, sure he had had a nightmare. His stomach rolled when he saw the pile of furniture by the door, heard, above the cooking sounds, the dreadfully familiar sound of the Wrath crackling in hideous parody of the frying pan that Danté was filling now with giant mushrooms. ‘Thought you might want some food,’ he said, conversationally, as if his life had not just been seconds from its end. ‘That was close, Sol. Very close. Good thing you found your way back to this shimmer. Top marks, my friend!’ ‘Believe me,’ Sol croaked. ‘It was not planned. How long have I been out, anyway?’ He rubbed his leg, which had developed a worrying throb, on one side from the searing lightning bolt, on the other with the deep ache of his sprained knee. ‘Not long. An hour, maybe.’ ‘Did…it…ever leave?’ he asked. ‘No. Didn’t get worse, mind. Just kind of sat there as if it was waiting. Never known it to do that before. Hmm… ’ Sol tried to stand, and immediately his weakened leg betrayed him and he fell with a sharp cry. ‘Now then, Sol, that leg’ll not get better like that. Here, sit.’ Danté brought the single chair that did not make up the mountain at the door and Sol slumped gratefully into it. It felt good to sit. A mounded plate of steaming mushrooms, crisp bacon and soft hot bread was dumped on his lap. He ate greedily, washing the lot down with huge mouthfuls of sweet creamy milk. A cup of the green brew ended the meal and he sat back, the pain in his leg, for the moment, gone. ‘Thanks, Danté. For everything,’ he said. ‘Don’t thank me yet. You’re not home yet.’ ‘Speaking of which,’ Sol said, ‘we run again?’ ‘We do. But not that way.’ He gestured to the door. Sol looked around him, eager to spot another secret exit, but found none. ‘Where…’ he began. Danté moved to the centre of the room and bent to the floor. A quick flick of one tiny finger against a knot in the wood revealed a hidden catch. He pulled this and Sol heard a rolling clunk, as if a huge key had been turned. A square portion of the floor to the side of the room rose by about three inches and revolved, revealing a dark passage that led downwards on stone steps seemingly cut into whatever passed for bedrock in this place. Sol raised his eyebrows. ‘And how am I supposed to fit in there?’ Their escape was a tiny trapdoor, no more than eighteen inches across and about nine wide. Danté waved his hand dismissively. ‘You’ll see. And besides, this might be our only way. She’s waiting, y’see. Can you still hear her?’ Sol admitted that he could, all the while. A hissing, groaning, crackling rumble, as if the thing had settled in to wait, and would not move until it had him in her grasp. He shuddered. ‘This may be the only way, Sol.’ Danté moved quickly to a set of drawers set deep into the walls of his room. Out of the top drawer, he pulled a long rolled up piece of paper, which he hurriedly set down on an empty space of floor and unrolled. He motioned Sol impatiently to hold down the loose end, which he did, a quizzical look beginning to appear on his face. His heart quickened as he saw Danté’s plan unfurling. ‘A map?’ he asked. ‘My map. Of all my shimmers’ locations.’ ‘So we can jump from here to anyone of these?’ he asked. He had left his chair, the pain in his leg momentarily forgotten, or gone, and squatted next to Danté. ‘And back again. That’s the idea. Remember, though, as I said. It’s not always that simple.’ The map looked like the mad workings of some insane mathematician. Swirls and circles with numbers and strange hieroglyphs marked inside them, that Sol took be shimmer locations, were crossed and crossed again, back and forth, with lines of scratched pen interlacing the whole so that it resembled a mad web of unending complexity. Across it all were more markings, words, numbers, blots of ink and smudges. The guard was tapping a claw on the map, at a point where the lines of intersection seemed to meet. Indeed, as Sol rose to get a better look, he saw more clearly. There was a definite centre to the chaos. ‘Home.’ ‘Just how many shimmers are there?’ Sol asked. ‘Thousands and thousands across the whole. I’ve never counted them all. I have…’ he seemed to count in his head, ‘two hundred and twelve, I think. New ones crop up from time to time. Doesn’t happen much any more, though.’ ‘Wow,’ was all Sol could say. Danté looked at him approvingly. ‘Indeed.’ The light in Danté’s room had dimmed. The candles that he lit were smelly, smoky things that spat grey wax onto everything within about three feet of them. Sol kept his distance. Danté was crouched over the map, pouring over it like some pirate, desperate to find a treasure. ‘Now,’ he said, ‘the easy part is the…er…going. The hard thing will be to decide exactly where to go to.’ The muted screeching from outside the door had intensified in the last few minutes. Sol could feel the hair on his arms prickling in the static atmosphere that was building up. ‘I think we had better make that decision sooner rather than later.’ Danté just looked at him. Without looking down at the map, he asked, ‘Now, where did you come in? Anything you remember? Anything at all?’ ‘Nothing. Grey floorboards. Come to think about it, the floorboards here are all brown, aren’t they? Does that help?’ ‘My boy, it helps! It helps!’ the guard cried. ‘You arrived at the Fifth station. All grey. Only place that is. Someone is on our side, I tell you!’ Sol looked confused. ‘This place is divided into stations. Areas, with exits and entrances to them. Only one is grey. The biggest, the grey one. The Fifth. Makes sense really. You arrive at the biggest station, because most doors lead there. Why didn’t I think!’ He began to beat his forehead quite alarmingly. Sol started to move toward him when he continued. ‘Only trouble is, there is only one shimmer that leads back there. We have to go, now. No time to lose, Sol.’ He headed to the trapdoor when Sol grabbed his arm and spun him on his heels. ‘I thought we had to go out there?’ he asked a little wildly, pointing at the barricaded door. ‘Ah, I told you that, didn’t I? Normally yes, but I have one other exit. Down there.’ He pointed down the rough-hewn steps that disappeared from the trapdoor. ‘But I’ll never fit…’ Sol started. ‘It has a way of….accommodating people,’ Danté explained. ‘You’ll see.’ They approached the trapdoor, and as Danté put his feet on the first step, Sol was sure he could hear the Wrath intensify its screams. His teeth began to ache, and he urged the guard on. The guard vanished down the steps. Sol reached one leg to the first step and as he did so, was aware of a sensation not unlike floating in water. He steadied himself on the edge of the nearby table, and then he was on the second step, then the third. He turned to look at the room one last time and was amazed to find that the edge of the trapdoor was level with his waist. How he would never know, but he was descending the steps through a trapdoor barely big enough to fit a child. It accommodates he thought. Whether that meant it grew, or he shrank he had no idea. And had no wish to know. He closed his eyes and descended. Danté was waiting at the foot of the staircase. A fluttering torch in his small hand lit the way about five feet in front of them, no more. ‘Come on,’ he said. ‘Not far. It’s not far.’ The door appeared in front of them as Danté neared it. It hazed into view behind the thickest shimmer Sol had yet seen. It looked blurred and out of shape. The guard grasped the handle and quickly opened it. They looked out on an expanse of dirty brown floorboards. Danté’s head dropped, and Sol’s heart with it. This wasn’t the fifth station. It was obvious. The Wrath hummed and buzzed like a millions rain drenched pylons. Sol looked up as the guard slammed the door hard. He seemed to be murmuring something, a prayer, and curse, Sol wasn’t sure. He opened the door again after the murmuring ceased. ‘YES!’ shouted Danté. The grey floorboards of the Fifth stretched away from them through the doorway. Sol felt some of his jubilation, but also felt the pull of the Wrath and knew it was near. Hell, it was everywhere. Sol hoped that it had a focus, a point that was forward and a point that was backward, and if so, the back was what they could see now. He shuddered with a fresh fear at the sight. It was everywhere, this thing. No longer gold and grey and blue flashes, the Wrath had turned black at its centre. Lightning arced down from it every few meters and the floor was scorched and blackened. It was as big as a world. A smell of burning wood and (flesh?) filled the air. Sol fought to keep his lunch down. ‘We have to go, Sol. Have to find your box!’ shouted Danté, raising his voice loud enough to be heard. They ran through the smoke and the heat haze that permeated the air. Ran towards the Wrath. Sol felt his breath catch in his throat, felt the hairs on the back of his arms fizz and crackle. He resolutely followed Danté as he weaved and ducked past lightning strikes. The going became more and more treacherous the nearer they got to the Wrath. Having run from it for so long, it seemed ludicrous to be running towards it. Now that they were near, Sol realised that they had never been near the thing. Not really. It was gargantuan, and now nothing of their environment showed past its bulk except the floor. Sol focused all his energies on the pattern of his feet, trusting to the guards unerring sense of direction. When he first thought he saw the box, standing on the floorboards like some discarded attic furniture, he almost ignored it, so channelled were his thoughts. He had almost left the reason for their flight behind him. A sharp tug on his arm brought him around and when he saw Danté pointing and pulling him round, his heart quickened and he followed. He sped up, if it were at all possible, and drew level with Danté. There was no doubt. The box stood before them, perhaps a hundred metres or so away. The lid was shut, and even through the gloom, Sol could see the grain gleaming dully. ‘How did you know where to find it?’ he shouted at Danté. The guard shrugged and grinned a huge whiskery grin. Sol clapped him on the shoulder. As Sol turned to look over his shoulder, to look one last time at the seething mass of stretched faces that made up the Wrath’s bulk, he saw the damaged floorboards a second too late. He felt his foot come down on floorboards that were splintered and cracked. He bare feet were lanced with pain as splinters drove themselves deep into the flesh there. He screamed. He was the luckier of the two. Danté stumbled on the broken floor. His feet were less than half the size of Sol’s, and where the man’s bridged the splintered holes, the guard’s pushed through the gap, hard. Even over the hiss and writhing hatred of the Wrath, Sol heard the snap of bone as clear as if the world had been in silence. Danté yelped and tumbled from Sol’s peripheral vision. He turned, unable to stop running now, and saw Danté mouthing at him. go go go GO GOGOGO! He stopped and watched in helpless horror as a fresh arc of lightning, slower than the rest and soot black inside, pierced the gloom and lit upon the guard’s upturned face. There was a moment of clarity in his eyes, of peace, and then all was hell. Danté’s features were stretched beyond reason, his body blackening and withering in the lightning’s grasp. Smoke rose from his curled form, and as his body burned, sickeningly, the noise from the Wrath abruptly ceased. All Sol was left with was the tortured screams of his new friend. He ran someway back toward him, and caught a look of pleading in his eyes. The look stopped him cold. There was a flash of light, and a renewed burning smell and Danté was gone. The Wrath began its chitinous, scrabbling frenzy afresh, and added to the mix now was just one more voice among innumerable others. He had lost his friend, and hatred boiled in Sol. He raised his fists, uselessly of course, at the mass, cursing the very day he had stumbled into the antique shop. He turned and ran, tears blurring his eyes, vowing to succeed where Danté had not. Twenty steps (he counted them all as a way of shutting his mind from the recent horror) brought him within six feet of the box. The dull woody gleam of its sides cut through the gloom, and he heard the choir of voices that had so enraptured him. The sound of the Wrath became even more intense as if to shut the choir out. Sol slowed his run and approached the box at a walk. He ran his hand over the closed lid, shut his eyes, and for a moment he could feel soft carpet under his feet, hear the blare and hum of distant traffic, taste the remnants of stale coffee on his tongue. He opened his eyes suddenly, sure that he would be home. But no. A haze around the box showed colours, patterns that Sol recognised as his wallpaper, but that faded almost instantly, so quickly in fact that he convinced himself that he had imagined it. He placed his hands again on the box. This time he left his eyes open, and there, around the box like a fuzzy halo, he saw his world trying to creep through the tattered edges of reality. It was there! He knew it. All he had to do was open the box and… The key! His fished desperately in his pockets, searching for the cold, hard chunk of metal that had brought him to this world of pain. A low moan escaped him as his hands found nothing. As if aware of his despair, the Wrath screamed louder than ever before, and did Sol hear mocking laughter in that noise? Surely not, but he turned wildly, and was quick enough, with a second to spare, to dodge a vicious lightning strike that lit down in front of the box, its eldritch light creeping around the base of the box like a living thing, a swamp mist. The sound of its strike was deafening and Sol screamed again. His throat burned and his eyes stung from the screaming and crying he had done here. Thick tarry smoke rose from the floorboards beneath him, and he turned away. He had to find the key, and as wrenching as it was to do, he ran a hand across the box, closed his eyes, offered a small prayer for Danté, and ran. He felt no fear, as if all his fear has drained from him now that he knew the box was his. He quickened his pace, seeing his route in his mind’s eye, never wishing to see the Wrath again. He knew he could run forever in this place blinded and never falter. It was just too vast. He matched his reverse route, had he but known, almost exactly. He envisaged leaving the relative safety of Danté’s room, and felt a strange pull. Open your eyes, he urged himself. Not yet. Not yet, just a few more feet ‘NOW!’ he screamed, shocking and emboldening himself in equal measure. His eyes flew open just in time to see a faint heat haze, the merest outline of a door. He reached for it, squeezed his eyes shut once more and formed a tight fist in the air. He felt cold metal in his hand and as he turned it, heard the faint snick of a door opening. His heart leapt and he copied it, literally hurling himself at the opening in space. He fell hard through the shimmer and landed with a breath-taking thud. The door slammed shut behind him. He was back in the guard’s room. Without the energetic, ever-moving guard here, the place appeared drab, as if in his dying, Danté had robbed the place of its own life. Sol mourned him quietly. He found a measure of the green brew and raised the battered cup high. He drank, letting the energy given drink wash through him. ‘You were a good friend, old guard,’ he said to no one. ‘A good friend.’ He downed the remainder of his drink and set the cup down. He looked around at the room, subtly altered and yet the same as the last time they had been there. Danté’s absence, he thought. He stared at the room hard. Tried to spot anything that seemed different to the last time he had been here. Anywhere that he may have left the key. Not on the chair, the table, not… He remembered suddenly plummeting into the room, falling hard on the floor and passing out. He dropped to his knees quickly, scoured the worn, bare floor for anything…and there! Trapped between two floorboards, a dull gleaming key. His key. He reached for it, scrabbling his fingers in the groove between two boards until the key shifted and came loose. A fingernail tore painfully, leaving a raw wet crescent that beaded blood. He let it come, let the stab of icy pain clear his mind of the torments. The blood dripped to the floor and he pressed it into the grainy boards, ceremoniously. ‘I’ll get out of here, Danté, if just for you. I will.’ He retrieved the key and stood facing the door. He remembered the guard’s warning that the door didn’t always open on the right place, and he remembered the trapdoor that had taken them to the Fifth. Somehow he knew it wouldn’t function without its owner, so it must be the door. He tried to envisage the station, the grey floorboards, and settled on an image of his box, before all this madness, standing on his living room carpet, glowing with a woody warmth. ‘OK, shimmer,’ he said, alarmed at the croak in his voice. ‘I’ve had about all the shitty luck I can stand. Just take me to the box.’ He had no idea if this was how Danté found his way around, but it seemed right. He only hoped it would succeed first time. Despite the drink, he had neither the energy nor the inclination to do this again. In the end, he needn’t have worried. A soon as he opened the door, he knew he had it right. He stole one last look at the room, and the smudged thumbprint of blood on the floor, the still drying smear on the edge of his cup. ‘Bye, Danté,’ he whispered and shut the door forever. The Fifth station was changed. The Wrath seemed to falling apart. It had lost none of its size, but jagged motes of dirty grey ash were falling everywhere, like hellish snow, like the aftermath of a volcano. Ozone and smoke pricked his nostrils and he walked calmly towards the box in the distance. The Wrath sent down lightning strikes all around him, but it was as if the key was some kind of talisman, protecting him from danger. The Wrath seemed to sense this and doubled its attack. Sol looked at the mass, smiling, and saw the damage it was causing itself in its anger. Great chunks of it were falling away, and falling as ashen clouds. Most had disintegrated by the time they hit the floor. Faces pulled and stretched away from the thing, (souls escaping, he surmised), and gone was the raw power that seemed to exude from it. Now it was an extinguished star reaching its end. Its innards boiled and churned with black fire, it configurations increased until to look at it was painful. Sol looked down, content to walk the way to the box and contemplate his friend’s passing. He reached the box finally and it was like coming home. He reached to it and stroked its surface. The key slid home and there was an intake of breath sounding like an avalanche as the Wrath realised its undoing. An arc of fire bolted through the gloom at him and scorched the side of one leg. He screamed in pain and lifted the lid of the box. ‘NO MORE!’ he screamed and lunged into the darkness that lay within the box. Sound ceased instantly and his ears whistled and hissed with its leaving. He had no senses now it seemed, sight, sound and taste all rendered useless in the utter absence of everything. He welcomed it, and sank into unconsciousness. When light hit him again, it was the soft, welcoming glow of dusky sunlight filtering in through his living room windows. He was sitting on his chair, the key in one hand, the box on the couch opposite. The pain from his torn fingernail was the only thing that dissuaded him from the notion that it had been a dream. The lid of the box was open and smoke wafted lazily from it, redolent with the smell of ozone and fire. He stood and looked into the blackness. Nothing. Not even a hint of the nightmare contents that had almost ended his life, and taken the life of his friend. He sat on the floor, rested his head on the side of the box, and cried. The days passed slowly for Sol, blurred round the edges as if he was looking through smoke. He ate, drank, worked. And he thought of Danté. He would be on a bus and would see his whiskered grin peering at him from a stranger. Sitting in his car, he would pass him on the street, see the casual wave of a hand, see, and sometimes hear, the crack of his whip-tail. He had unplugged his phone as soon as he had woken up that first night, and yet sometime, always at night, he would hear whisperings down the line, screeches and muted howls that took him back. Back to hell. Four days later, eyes blood-shot and tired from lack of sleep, Sol hefted the box into the back of his car. He drove for miles, through villages, across lonely desolate moors where lightning jagged down from the clouds the Wrath and thunder split the air in deafening peals. He stopped next to a crumbling dry-stone wall, and opened the back door of his car. He looked at the box for a moment, and quickly, as if to deny himself any real thinking time, he grabbed it and slung it over the wall. It landed softly in the mud, one corner sinking in it. That night he dreamed. Danté was berating him, silently, as if a ghost, beating his tiny clawed hands on Sol’s chest. He was whisked away into the air suddenly, by hands made of black fire, and a deafening laugh rent the air so that Sol’s ears began to slowly bleed. The Wrath grew above him, larger and more violent than ever, faces appearing and then disappearing as quickly as Sol could focus on them. One face remained, however. That of Danté. Stretched and wrought into a nightmare of features, it screamed down at him, begging, pleading to be released. Sol tried to speak but was cut off by the intense noise. Suddenly all sound was silenced in a shock of pain and fresh blood coursed from his ears. The Wrath had finally deafened him. Sol had time to think how ironic it was that the one thing that the Wrath had used to tempt and terrify him, was the one thing that finally stopped the Wrath being terrifying. Without noise, it was no more than an angry cloud, venting its power. Sol closed his eyes, and without sight, the Wrath was nothing. A hand closed on his. He opened his eyes, sat up in bed, fully awake. The hand scratched slowly down his and disappeared. He flicked on the bedside lamp, which sat on a chair, and saw nothing. You must come back, Sol. You must come back for me… The voice was scratchy, hissing like air escaping a tyre, but it was unmistakably Danté’s. Sol rubbed his hands across his face and looked again. Nothing. Was Danté still alive? Surely not, after seeing his blackened hulk vaporised by the Wrath, hearing and seeing his death throes as the guard was lifted into the mass of the Wrath. Sol agonised that point over breakfast, at work, over lunch, on the drive home and all through the next night and into the morning, without a minute’s sleep. He screamed his frustration at the bathroom mirror, marvelling at the demented, unshaven beast that screamed back at him. He left the house for the last time the next morning. A cold, metal object sat in his pocket, and when he touched it, chimes sounded, a thousand chimes, a hundred thousand; all of them ringing in a wind that he could not feel. The key. He drove through villages, across desolate moors where the clouds hung low and oppressive. He stopped by a dry-stone wall, and got out of his car. He had the unerring single-mindedness of a man contemplating suicide. He looked over the wall, knowing what he would see. The box sat where he had dropped it, one corner sinking slightly into the thick mud, the dull glow of its grain vibrant even in the morning gloom. He climbed the wall, unmindful of the avalanche of stones that preceded him. As he pulled the key from his pocket, the box glowed deeper, and the chimes began again. Voices were raised in jubilation and as Sol lowered the key to the brass lock, he whispered, ‘I’m coming Danté. This is my portal; this is my way. I am the box. I am coming for you.’ The darkness lasted for a millenium. When light edged into his vision, Sol opened his eyes to a blackened, smoking, twisted ruin. The floor, where it had been grey and straight, was charred and pitted with fire. He looked upwards and saw nothing except long stretches of night. There was no end to it. Far off in the distance, he saw what had become of the Wrath. It was a thousandth of its size now, twisting and knotting itself like a coil of vipers in extremis. He smiled, and the Wrath boiled its anger down towards him. He would fear it again, he knew, but not yet. Not yet. He walked, and he found a shimmer. They called to him now, and he could see them like a silvery heat-haze in the air. He opened the door in the first one and was back in Danté’s room again. His room now, he supposed. He sat, drew the map of shimmers to him, and waited. Soon enough he would hear from Danté again, and he would know how to reach him. He would save him. He studied the map. He saw all his shimmers across the void, and he began to memorise them. As a Guard O’ the Wrath, he would need to know them. He smiled, and raised a glass of the green brew. Tomorrow, he would start exploring this place, and he would make himself ready for when the Wrath grew in power and size and threat. There would be people like himself to save. ",candidate00006
12,00001,candidate00007,"A guitar riff into the future PhD student Tim O’Shenko slipped out of the Portsmouth Guildhall for a smoke. In Britain the anti-smoking legislation had become severe. If caught lighting up in public Tim would be forced to smoke an extra two packets as punishment. Within the civic centre, Rin Tizzy Too, a Thin Lizzy tribute act, were giving their all. Unrestrained by convention, Thin Lizzy’s music barely appeared in their repertoire. Standards from TRex to Van Halen were straining the amplifiers. What the musicians lacked in talent, musicality or shame was compensated for in raw sound energy. A fan of retro-rock, Tim made his jailbreak when he could no longer bear the murder of classic anthems. Leaning against a tree near a poorly lit war memorial and drawing on his cigarette Tim wondered if his eyeballs were suffering from the concussive waves escaping the building because there was a haze around people queuing to get in. It was a surprise that people still wanted in when everyone in the city could hear the quality of the performance. Stunned pigeons lying around the guildhall square legs twitching to the beat should have been ample warning. It was then Tim spotted himself handing over his ticket to enter the building. Space-time was being warped by Rock! The next morning Tim’s thoughts galloped like crazy horses as he walked through basement levels of the Physics Faculty at the University of Portsmouth. Here were the laboratories above which was Tim’s little office. A theory solidified as he sat down in front of his computer. Tim wrote his extraordinary paper in a day. Equations, squiggly diagrams and the word ‘quantum’ flowed from his fingers and into the computer. The universe was vibrations of the quantum foam. Sound was vibrations and the vibrations of the quantum foam. If a sound was shaped so were the quantum vibrations. If you had an amplifier of suitable power then the universe could be changed with the right tune. Macro and quantum universes weren’t supposed to interact directly, but he and two dozen traumatised birds had seen it. Tim didn’t take the concept too far because this was radical thinking and could lose him his research grant. Instead he framed it as a proposal that sound could cross a vacuum by measuring the changes on a quantum level. There was Heisenberg to deal with, but Tim prided himself on being able to win research grants (his lifestyle depended on it) and thus Heisenberg would become the key to asking for more beer money. Tim never thought that his progress was being monitored. A virus so sinister that it made computers run faster and with less crashes had infected every machine on the planet. It watched for keywords. Tim won the prize for most used keywords that decade; he would have to be dealt with. Confidently emailing his great work to his professor Tim decided now was a good time for a beer. The email was intercepted and rerouted as he shut the door to his office. The contents of his computer were wiped as he walked through the subterranean halls. His paper notes would vanish with a cleaner who only did one night’s work. Wisely the city planners had placed a row of pubs directly outside the university’s main buildings. For lunch Tim had three pints and, to make sure he wasn’t drinking on an empty stomach, a bag of peanuts. It was nearly 3pm when he decided he should return to work. With a mellow feeling of a man who knows he’s very clever Tim ambled down the steps of the hostelry. A stretched limonene with blacked out windows aligned itself with its target. Tim ambled across the narrow road. The vehicle accelerated. Tim crossed safely then heard the car draw up behind him. “Excuse me,” said a husky-voiced female. A woman leaned out of the back window. He was aware of a national cleavage shortage and could see why. This girl was using up half the country’s supply. He didn’t register her face because of the barely constrained orbs threatening to escape her skin-tight black leather minidress. “Er… yes?” “I am looking for the Physics Building,” she whispered provocatively forcing Tim to lean closer, which he didn’t mind at all. “It’s up those steps on the corner.” “Oh good, physics turns me on. Are you a physicist?” Tim’s throat had gone dry. “Yes,” he squeaked. “Oh good.” “Oh good,” he repeated. Physics groupies were a particular unfulfilled hope for Tim. If she were slightly drunk she’d be perfect. “I need a place to park this car, would you help me?” The door popped open and the girl uncurled her long legs sheathed in fishnet stockings ending in high stilettos. “Oh good… er, I mean oh yes. These a par cack, I mean, car park. There’s a car park. Oh yes, I can help.” Tim climbed in with the girl who managed to run those beautiful legs against his. Thoughts one hundred percent carnal were interrupted when she stunned him with a Taser. Water splashed over Tim’s face. He awoke on a gilded nineteenth century chaise lounge. Towering over him was the girl dressed as before hence it took a long time for him to spot the Taser in the opposite hand to the glass of water. “He’s up,” she stated then poured the rest of liquid on his face. “Cool,” coo-ed a man. Tim had moments to take in a room big enough to house aircraft, full of antiques of random taste and style. They had been arranged in the same way a toddler arranges its playthings. The man approached offering his hand. Expecting violence Tim recoiled then had a good look at the man and recoiled in fashion shock. Physicists are usually immune to this since most stick to the rule: thin for hot weather, thick for cold and leave tailoring details to others. A wiry man nearing fifty he wore a T-shirt and shrink-tight jeans. His face was lined through years of excess that Tim would never be able to match even in his physics groupie fantasies. His hair was like an electrocuted poodle. Ringlets of defunct dog hung loosely dancing about as he moved. “I know you,” Tim said cautiously shaking the man’s firm hand. “Sure you do, but call me Fahrenheit, or Mr F for short. You are clever Tim O’Shenko. You worked it all out didn’t you? Spotted our clues: the spaceships on the album covers and videos. Why someone with a PhD in astrophysics gave up the pleasures of hard science be the lead guitarist in a rock band. The Einstein/Stones tongue clue. Not that Mick understands what’s going on, but he’s always game.” “Yes… er, yes,” Tim stuttered without any clear idea of what was going on. “I don’t think he gets it,” Ms Taser said. “Katie, he can’t get it until we show him. Can yer man?” “No, best to show me.” Tim agreed hoping to reduce the likelihood of future electric shocks. “You’re not the first to discover the link between music and space-time,” Mr F began. “After that mistake with the atom bomb, the scientists who discovered it couldn’t dare share this secret with politicians. That was where rock met science!” Mr F ended like Tim would understand. “Yes indeed,” Tim said after realising there was a pause for him to speak. “He doesn’t get it,” Katie said. “Over thirty years ago it was discovered that if you pick the right rock track, amplify it then focus in the right direction whoooooosh!” “Whoosh,” Tim agreed, then pointing at Katie, “Don’t say it. I think I’ve got it.” Pause. “Nope, you’ll have to tell me.” “Faster than light drive.” There was a longer pause as Tim didn’t know whether to laugh (and get stunned again) or continue pausing (and delay being stunned). “Yeah man, my musical brothers and I supply the rock, Katie and her egghead dudes do the science and whoooooosh!” “Stadium rock works best,” Katie stated with a sour expression. “Rock stars earn lots of money which helps. Half the tech here was built under guise of rich men’s whims or set designs. Say you try to buy heavy water in bulk. Every intelligence agency in the world will be going through your trash.” “Hey, I just said I wanted the most expensive water in the world for my pool and they said how much do you want. Cool huh? Champagne fountain, heavy water pool, no one cares. Then of course my buddy wants to out do me and orders the same; then my other buddy does the same. No one cares.” “We make our own now on a Caribbean island owned by —” “By?” “Need to know,” Katie said, “Exclusive recording studio.” “With the biggest damn power station you ever saw!” added Mr F. “Shall we give him the tour?” “Kinda pointless bringing him here if we don’t,” she replied. “Cool, I love showing off.” Tim thought the same could be said of Katie in her revealing attire. “Follow me Tim. This is the European base of operations, rock and science united in making a better world.” Mr F explained leading them to double doors inlaid with silver. “Got everything here indoor Olympic pool, gym, beach volleyball.” Beyond was an elevated walkway either side were huge rooms. There were men and women in each enjoying the luxury. “It’s important to stay chilled. Get fit in mind and body and party!” Tim stopped to look down on the beach volleyball court where four bikini clad women were raking the sand at the end of a game. “I thought you’d be more interested in the library,” Katie thumbed on the opposite side of the walkway. Reluctantly Tim switched sides. Sweeping away were four storeys of book shelves. “We get every learned journal and have on-tap any research material you might want.” “Hmmm,” he said noncommittally. “The off-duty librarians were playing volleyball.” “And do you play volleyball?” Tim recovered more quickly from being Taser-ed the second time. Mr F was slapping his face. “Katie doesn’t like dumb-ass remarks about how she looks,” Mr F warned too late. “She used be forty pounds heavier and got a lot of comments, now she’s fit she still gets comments.” “Fit’s the word I’d use,” said Tim after checking Katie was no where in sight. “No one asks Katheryne about the dozen papers in Nature she’s written on quantum cosmology and superconductors, just her body. It’s the downside of being a dancer.” “Dancer? Katie… Katheryne… ” Tim clambered up. “Yeah, she’s one of my dancers when the band tours. Great way to visit our friends without being of any interest to anyone, drop out child prodigies are two a penny.” “Katheryne… cosmology and superconductors. Featherstone! That’s K K Featherstone! Good God!” Tim looked at Mr F. “I thought she’d vanished into some University. She’s got to be thirty-four, thirty-five.” Ancient to the twenty-seven year old Tim. “Thirty-eight.” “She is fit.” “Word to the wise, if you don’t want a fat lip don’t talk about her body.” Mr F pushed open matching double doors at the end of the walk way and into a grand dinning room. This was Renaissance decadence with a twenty-first century twist. It was gold, gaudy and garish to the point of criminality. Tim stopped to stare whilst Mr F continued down the length of a table large enough to play hockey on. “We kept this and the bedrooms for show, but scooped out the rest of the chateau. We got four sound stages, dance studio, forty-babe hot tub, roadies, electricians, pyrotechnicians, set builders, geeks of every shade. All you need to keep a world-shaking rock band on the road or a science network under wraps.” Upon reaching the other end of the table Mr F discovered he was alone. “Tim, keep up or you’ll miss your flight.” “This is either real or the greatest wind up in history,” Tim said. “Hey, Tim, you’re a nobody. You ain’t worth my time for some kind of gag.” “How do I know you don’t get off on suckering nobodies?” “I get off on sleeping with as many women as I can and the adulation of fifty thousand screaming fans who want to be me! Occasionally smoking a spliv staring into Jupiter’s great red spot at point blank range does it for me too. C’mon man I didn’t bring you to France for this.” Tim hurried along the table with two time zones. “I can’t be in France, I wasn’t out that long.” “Depends on how fast you can go and I am fast!” Mr F took Tim around the chateau explaining how they were channelling their discoveries to help mankind, whilst anything with weapon potential was strictly kept for them. The tour ended in a leather-lined room in the centre of the building, cameras and screens were inset into the tanned cow walls. “We do TV interviews and satellite link-ups here,” Mr F said. Gesturing with a finger Mr F called Tim over, who was gaping at very familiar furnishings. “Didn’t you do that notorious MTV awards link in here? You were all doped to the eyeballs.” “Man, we were sober as judges except… except we’d just come back from saving Delhi from being totalled by a meteor. Trust me; you can’t get a high like that with drugs.” Mr F pressed a stud in the leather and a stainless steel pole rose up from the floor. Hidden coloured lights began playing their beams over it and the floor around. “Don’t tell me Katie does that kind of dancing.” “Maybe on her days off,” Mr F said pressing a second stud that caused the floor beneath the pole open. He slid, via the pole, out of sight. Tim followed and nearly broke his ankles crashing into the floor. “Always wanted to be a fireman – not!” Mr F explained pulling Tim upright. They were in a mechanic’s workshop if mechanics created exotic abstract sculptures out of gold and silver. Around the walls were benches with hundreds of drawers above and below. Amongst the strange items were more familiar ones; such as: soldering irons, sheaths of paper, mugs of coffee, paper aeroplanes, a handful of butchered Fender Stratocasters and a Moog that had been forced to mate with an amplifier. Paper notes were stapled to the walls. Computers with huge screens were showing graphs morphing into mathematical landscapes as iterations evolved. Tim could smell ionising air. There was the hum of high voltage. A tingling sensation warned him of the same. Also there was a rising excitement. This was a physics lab. Here were the equations that he had solved last night made real. Rock chicks in fishnet stockings might punch his biological buttons, but the biggest hits he got were when the weirdness of physics exploded into the madness of reality. “She solved the vacuum energy problem.” “Katie and others; apparently you gotta realise there isn’t a vacuum and zero is zero, but not nothing or something like that, but hey that’s not for me to fret about.” Mr F had to take Tim by the shoulders to pull him away from the hypnotic power of complex mathematics. They stood in a hanger and in front of the most amazing object Tim had ever seen. Seeing it confirmed everything, apart from what Katie did on her days off, was Gospel truth. “It’s based on a Lamborghini Diablo,” Mr F said ushering Tim toward it. “Nah, actually the Diablo is based on it.” Mr F continued talking yet Tim couldn’t hear him. His eyes studied every line of the extraordinary vehicle. It was a big faceted wedge angled like a sprinter straining on starting blocks. Sharp edged panels blended into a central transparent sphere that was obscured by ribs running bow to stern flowing around the shapes and looking like cooling fins which they couldn’t be. The rear became black blocks two stories high. Crazy Little Thing was written in gold letters riveted onto the flanks of the blocks. “No heat shielding or scorching,” Tim mumbled. It was impressive he retained enough self-control not to dribble. “It’s sheathed in a nickel super alloy for safety, but Mercury class ships have enough spare power to slow themselves down before hitting the atmosphere so no significant frictional heating.” Katie had returned. She was the only sight that could break the siren hold of the Crazy Little Thing because it looked like she’d been dipped in white chocolate with tubes and wires set into the coating in all the places that Tim would have chosen to make a great body achieve perfection. He was drooling now. Katie threw a large white blob that hit him full in the face. Pulling it away as it threatened to suffocate him, Tim discovered it was an identical costume to Katie’s. It flowed in his grip. “Put it on,” Katie commanded. “What this?” Rolling her eyes heavenward, she said, “You did write that paper didn’t you? You’re not some clerical error?” “I did; I’m suffering from information overload.” “It’s your spacesuit. It’s elasticated so it doesn’t have to be pressurised also it exercises your muscles so they don’t atrophy as fast.” “It feels thick,” Tim said realising it was the reason the woman’s curves were curvier than before. “Two layers sandwich microscopic piezoelectric crystals, it behaves like a non-Newtonian fluid so it goes hard if impacted, protects from micro-meteors. It’s an insulator too so you won’t cook or freeze.” “I know what a non-Newtonian fluid is. It’s why you can walk on custard.” “We’ve all walked on custard,” Mr F stated and both scientists looked at him. “I don’t need a spacesuit,” Tim said. “Yes you do, now take all your clothes off and put it on. Use the changing room over there.” “Right, right,” Tim said. Her second skin gave no place for her to hide a Taser; he decided not to be proven wrong and headed for the changing room. “Have I got to take everything off?” “The suit reacts in antiphase to the acoustic pressure the engines flood the cabin with. Electrical charges pulse through the suit to affect the crystals to prevent you being pulverised by the sound waves. It works like those sound neutralising headphones you can buy. Wear something underneath and you’ll get bruised at best, broken at worst.” Doubtful but obedient Tim entered the changing room. He undressed then picked up the white costume that oozed between his fingers. Having never worn a cat suit before, Tim faced the challenge uncertainly, giving the stretchy material a tug or two finding pulling it quickly it became stiff whilst a slow pull made it yield easily. Unlike the lithe woman with a dancer’s suppleness, the only dexterous feat Tim had could claim was drinking a pint of beer through his nose. The neck hole was the single entrance; it stretched against his effort to snap snugly around his neck when released. Unfortunately his head was in the outfit and his naked body outside. Greater effort was required to extricate his head before he suffocated as panic lead to hard yanking which caused the suit to put up maximum resistance. Tim fought like a streaker attacked by an epileptic albino squid until the suit eased off his head with a pop. After that with much wriggling and swearing, Tim finally wore his new attire. Tim did look coated in white chocolate except it had melted gathering in creases and bulges around his gut. Returning to the Crazy Little Thing, the more pleasant vision in white had donned a large helmet and handed him one. The headgear clamped on his neck and the padding inside began expanding sealing the neck joint. A high fidelity voice reached his ears. “Can you hear me?” It was Katie. “Yes,” Tim said. “Good, follow me.” The Crazy Little Thing was lined in the same yielding material as the suit. Tim didn’t manage to have much of a look around as he was led up to the cockpit. He realised most of the volume of the craft was engines and power generation. Katie pushed him into one of a pair of Recaro seats with five-point racing harnesses. He tried to act like a scientist as she fastened him in. “You’ve said the engines are based on amplifiers but what is supplying the energy, it must take one hell of a lot.” Katie slipped into the pilot’s seat and hit a button. The craft lurched into the vertical as the ceiling slowly slid out of the way. Briefly water poured from the growing view of the sky. “The main complex is under the house, but the hangar doors are under the pool. Water is a great radar absorber. Mind you it’s also lined with anechoic materials.” “I asked about the power.” “Fusion.” “Cold or Hot?” “Jazz.” The ship’s controls were pedals for speeding up and slowing down and a wheel for turning. Katie shifted in to D and floored it. Tim awoke to a bright slivery glow. “You’re going to have to get fit if you want to do this regularly.” “I wasn’t ready, I pulled must have been nine or ten g’s.” “Four. It’s about then inertia is cancelled out.” Out of the window was the Moon or rather five hundred meters away a bright wall of craters and softly sloping terrain. “Stone me,” Tim observed The landscape continued to grow. “Aren’t we getting a little close?” Katie ignored him. Crazy Little Thing swooped in. The peanuts he’d eaten earlier wanted to leave, his stomach wanted to follow. He could feel his lack of weight: this was real. He wanted to follow his stomach. The craft descended onto the surface. Outside was the base of a lunar lander sitting in the centre of a blast pattern. Less than five meters away from Crazy Little Thing’s bow stood an American flag. “This can’t be real,” Tim said out loud to convince his digestive system; otherwise the inside of the suit wouldn’t stay white. “You’ve got me in a simulator. This is a wind up. No radiation. I’m getting no flashes where cosmic rays fly through my eyeballs.” “We’re shielded. Mercuries are good up to a coronal mass ejection outside the orbit of Venus.” “That flag, it was blown over when Apollo Eleven returned to the command module.” “It has fallen down three times in the last fifty years. Some of our American members tend to it. Twice we’ve had to get it back when others put up the Confederate flag instead. Let me show you something.” Shifting into R Crazy Little Thing backed away from the historic site. It spun on its vertical axis (by pulling the spin-in-vertical-axis lever) then headed for a nearby hillock. Skimming over sterile regolith the ship followed the curve of the land to dip into a shallow valley and then up to a taller peak. Tim’s knuckles were white inside their white cushioned gloves. In a power slide Katie brought the Crazy Little Thing to a stop on the summit. In front of Tim was a field of flags. Almost every nation was represented. “Now’s the moment of decision,” Katie said. “You have to decide whether you’re with us or not.” “What happens if I’m not?” “You’ll never go into space again.” “Oh God, you’re going to kill me. This is all to lure me away so my body will never be found.” Katie’s groan was thunderous. “We’re not that kind of secret organisation; that’s so clichéd. Haven’t you got any imagination?” “I have a great imagination, but I know all your secrets —” Katie stifled a laugh. “You’ll have to keep me silent from telling the world.” “What? That spacecraft propelled by Rock are controlled by a conclave of scientists and musicians?” “Er… yes, but you’re K K Featherstone. You’ve got science cred.” “Look up my history sometime. I am a burnt out wunderkind. I haven’t written a paper for twenty years.” “Ah, but my work—” “Will be discredited,” Katie said. “You can join us and help slowly bring incredible technology to the world without being used for war or, if you don’t want to, we’ll set you up in one our research companies with a salary so big you’ll forget about telling the world anything. Choosing option two means you never see the inside of a spacecraft again.” Tim looked at Katie’s helmet and wondered what her face looked like. “I need a smoke.” “There are some cigars in a humidor in the chill out room. Look for the drinks cabinet.” “This ship has a drinks cabinet?” “It’s for Rock Gods; the cabins have mirrored ceilings too.” “I’m in.” ",candidate00007
13,00002,candidate00007,"The praying never stopped at St. Barbara's convent and Mary couldn't stand it any more. She had joined the convent in February and now during an oppressive August night the rhythmic verses were boring into her mind releasing all she had been suppressing. Waking Mary wanted to dash her throbbing head on the rough brick walls of her cell. Staggering into the corridor she groped in the half-light toward the nearest barred window. Beyond the bars were the industrial shadows of London's East End. For all her need to escape the relentless pressure, Mary couldn't face what awaited her in the outside world. Resting her head on the cool bars eased the pulsating pain. Rubbing her forehead on the coarse metal distracted her enough for a moment's peace. Maybe she was going down with the fever that had been afflicting the nuns. Each day there was another woman missing. The thinning numbers had become noticeable, even to someone new like Mary. A candle glow appeared at the end of the corridor. Mary flopped to the ground hoping her white nightgown wouldn't be seen. The candle bearer passed. The novice wondered why she had hidden. Guilt probably, a legacy of her past life, like the slight trembling of her hands. It made Mary follow the light. Three nuns shared the candle. They walked in silence descending from the dormitory floors through the living spaces and into the cellar. A Victorian pile St Barbara's sat on a huge cellar; a vaulted area of heavy columns divided with brick walls into rooms. The party stopped near the stairs by some disused cells. Hiding by a column, Mary could finally see enough to identify the women. Sister Rachel, doctor for the convent's clinic for 'fallen women', pulled a heavy bolt on one of the cells. Sister Beatrice, the mother superior, was revealed by the light coming from the cell. She rested her hand on Rebecca; the only person Mary would call a friend. An innocent girl of twenty, Rebecca had seen none of the world and didn't want to, unlike the thirty-year-old novice. She'd found her calling early seizing it with a single-minded focus Mary was jealous of. Rebecca who took it upon herself to help novices. She and Mary always breakfasted together. Sister Beatrice ushered her into the cell. The bolt was thrown, padlocked in place and the remaining women left. Mary held herself tightly to the shadows allowing the others to pass before creeping to the cell door. Ear pressed to the door Mary thought she could make out Rebecca praying, then there was a gasp. Mary sat in Sister Beatrice's office opposite the full authority of the mother superior. She had been summoned the next morning after breakfast, which Rebecca had missed. Sister Beatrice was in her early forties with clean striking features. There was cunning in her eyes and a thin smile as if she knew what life could offer and had enjoyed experiencing it all. ""You left this behind,"" the mother superior stated holding up the tip of a broken knife. ""Before you deny it, I had your cell searched during breakfast. This was found."" The remainder of the knife appeared in her hands. ""I would prefer a confession Victoria."" When the cutlery broke in the lock the novice knew she was caught, but how had Sister Beatrice found out who she was? ""You know who I am?"" Victoria alias Mary replied. ""Do you think when a woman goes missing the police don't contact us? They know we collect girls who need help."" ""You haven't told my parents? Not about the baby."" ""Of course I haven't, but the police know you are safe and they will have passed the news on to your parents. You can contact them if you want to or not. Nothing has been said about the abortion. That is for your conscience. Now, Mary or Victoria, are you going to confess?"" ""I'd prefer Mary, I'm not proud of who I was."" ""Victoria still seems to be present. Was it her who was breaking into the drugs store?"" ""It's the drugs store?"" ""Are you denying your actions? I had so hoped you had freed yourself from the addiction to intoxicants."" ""I haven't touched any drugs since I came here. Not even the communion wine. I'm certain I saw you lock Sister Rebecca in that cell."" ""Why would I do that?"" ""I… "" Victoria was aware the older woman looked straight at her hands which she held tightly to stop them disobeying her. ""Are you still having the nightmares? I remember the delusions you suffered when we first found you."" Sister Beatrice asked. ""No I'm not delusional, I saw a light, I followed you and I saw you lock Rebecca in that cell."" ""I'm not sure she'd fit in the store, it's full of shelves. Delirium tremens produces vivid hallucinations. Perhaps you're not clear yet. How many nights did I sit with you screaming about demons and murder?"" Victoria's hands began shaking for a different reason. The eternal chanting coming from the chapel was hammering into her skull like nails. ""I've never said anything about demons. I'm sure I didn't say anything about demons."" ""You are troubled Victoria. You are still not at peace. I forgive you. Go and pray in the chapel, take time to organise your thoughts to know what is real and what isn't."" Victoria left without a word. Not to the chapel, but to search for Rebecca. Lying on her bed fully clothed Victoria waited for darkness to cover her escape. She had decided to leave before she too vanished. Evading Sister Beatrice's lieutenants as she searched, Victoria had failed to find her friend. Victoria knew she had to be in the cellar. It remained the only place yet to be examined. Victoria did find more empty cells than she expected. Each one like Rebecca's, Spartan and clean readied for the nun's return except some had dust thick enough to grey what it covered. Victoria decided she would search the cellars and escape by them, through the coal cellar's hatch. It was a matter of waiting for the convent to sleep. While dusk turned to night, and the river traffic of the world's greatest port quietened, Victoria tried to remember every night in the clinic's wards. Victoria was sure in all the nightmares, all the pain, she had said nothing about the night that had left her lying in an ally. Perhaps she had called her best friend's name. Maybe she repeated the pleading in her fever. Never would she have mentioned demons. Ceaseless Latin verse cycled through the fabric of the convent. Voices rebounding in her head, steady and unending grew clearer as all other sounds faded. An oppressive heat rose with the night, she sweated and feared until finally she acted. Along the empty corridors Victoria travelled quietly. All the while there was an urge to run, dash wildly and keep running until she was as far from the echoing halls and sounds in her head. At the top of the stairs to the cellar Victoria stopped. Without a light the windowless void below was as black as blindness. Her hands were shaking again. Memories of another cellar and a gunshot. Perhaps she could save a friend this time. Into the cellar Victoria felt for every tread the memory of the layout turning in her mind as she approached the locked cell like it was the edge of a cliff. ""Victoria,"" Sister Beatrice's voice softly rang. An oil lamp was uncovered its dazzling light froze Victoria. The mother superior and Sister Rachel were blocking the stairs. She must have walked between them. ""Victoria,"" Sister Beatrice began. ""No!"" Victoria shouted and a second knife stolen for attacking the padlock was in her hand. ""Get back."" ""Victoria, we want to help."" ""No."" ""Rachel, if you'd be so kind,"" Beatrice said. With practiced skill the doctor lunged catching and twisting Victoria's wrist. A thumb in the correct joint and shooting pain forced Victoria to drop the blade. Rachel continued to twist the arm forcing it behind Victoria's back. Victoria screamed defiance and dived for the floor pulling free almost dislocating her limb in the process. Scrambling up Victoria bolted for the coal store door, shouldering it open she stopped. Lying on pallets hands crossed over their chests were nuns. There were at least thirty women with spaces ready for a dozen more. A lighted candle at the head of each made their cold white skin glow. Sister Rachel grabbed Victoria from behind. Victoria threw herself backward arms flaying. Rachel lost her grip. Victoria snatched up a brass candlestick ignoring the hot wax spilling on her hand. Rachel recovered and came for Victoria again. Wheeling Victoria hit Rachel with all her weight. She felt and heard Rachel's skull crack. The nun crumpled. On the floor a thin line of blood, black in the poor light, flowed lazily from her head. Staring at what she had done for once Victoria's thoughts were louder than the praying. Sister Beatrice arrived. ""Get back,"" Victoria warned, preparing for another strike. Ignoring the blunt instrument wavering above her, Sister Beatrice bent down to check for pulse and breathing. ""Her breath is regular; the bleeding is not as bad as it looks."" With a handkerchief she made up a pad for the wound. ""She'll survive, but she'll be of no use tonight."" ""I want out of here,"" Victoria demanded. It was happening again. Violence seemed to be part of her soul, bubbling up with tragic consequences. To survive she had to escape and to do that she would have to brain another victim. Hands shaking as if eager to move in a fatal downward arc she gripped the candlestick with two hands holding it back. ""I cannot let you leave here, you are too dangerous."" Sister Beatrice said standing. ""Me? I am too dangerous? What about these women you've killed?"" ""I've hurt no one. I will never hurt a living soul."" ""What about them?"" Victoria's wild eyes flicked about the room yet her impromptu weapon stayed ready to strike again. ""The sisters here are in coma. They will recover, but will sleep for several weeks. It is the penalty for donating more blood than is safe to do so, but the cause is vital."" Sister Beatrice edged closer, ""You have killed. I know of two, but will there more?"" ""How..?"" ""The praying still hurts you doesn't it? It burns in your head, getting worse each day?"" ""Let me out. Please let me out,"" Victoria begged, her arms wilting. ""I had hoped we could help you because this convent is a protected place. Evil cannot enter here, but you are cursed and bound to it. You are doomed."" ""It's not true."" ""Cursed by the friend you killed and too quick to violence to stay here."" ""I'm not damned,"" Victoria whispered, after months of repression, a tear finally escaped. ""The incantations of faith bring peace, but not to those who are already lost."" Beatrice took the candlestick and placed it on the floor. ""While you live you can still do good."" ""I'm cursed. I bring death,"" Victoria said. ""Not even my own child was safe."" ""Change that tonight,"" Beatrice urged. ""We shelter those who work against the darkness. One was tracking a new evil to the city. He was trapped in the open when dawn came. One of my patrols found him like they found you. For once I offer you a chance to save a life."" The mother superior took Victoria's hand and led her to the locked cell. Sister Beatrice unlocked and opened the door. An oil lamp filled the room with light. On the bed was a man. His once handsome face had been burned with a terrible heat, a shadow of his hand held up to shield him from the fire was clearly visible. Those hands lay outside the bed fingers charred stubs. Victoria was drawn to the man. She sat on the stool by his bed. His eyes bandaged, mole-like he turned to Victoria, sniffing. ""Why's he sniffing?"" ""It's the tiny droplets of Rachel's blood on your habit. It's exciting his baser nature."" ""One can't smell blood."" ""That poor wretch can,"" the Mother Superior said. ""He needs it to survive. Normally he can live on substitutes, but if he is to recover from these injuries he has to take human blood and the essence of our souls it contains."" Victoria felt her world shifting from the reality. She wondered if this was a trick of her drug-damaged brain. Was she in fact lying in some gutter her mind spinning stories as life finally ebbed away? ""What are you saying?"" ""The truth."" Beatrice paused before sighing. ""His Christian name is Paul. Given to him by St Martin of Tours. Paul has fought evil ever since, but his own crimes fill centuries. He has no soul yet works for redemption."" ""What is he?"" ""Someone in need of help. In need of your help."" Paul's deformed fingers were reaching for Victoria. She stood up backing away. ""I can't help anyone I destroy everything I touch."" ""Here is where that can change. No one else is ready. I need you to help him. You simply have to stay with him and let him feed."" ""I can't."" Victoria looked back. Paul was growing in activity. Although bandaged, his eyes tracked her. Sister Beatrice continued. ""He will only take what he needs, but don't struggle. His animal hunger is close to the surface and behaving like prey would not be safe. He could kill you or worse."" ""Worse?"" ""He is waking will you do it?"" Victoria thought of her disintegrating life and how death was always in her hands. She sat down. Victoria took Paul's nearest hand. Corpse-cold it tightened on her fingers. ""Perhaps I might do good for once. Perhaps this is all a lie and this is my end. Perhaps for one night I won't fight."" Sister Beatrice shut the door and threw the bolt home. ",candidate00007
14,00001,candidate00008,"The house looks exactly like it did eighteen years ago—the brush grew thicker after Mama got sick—but the inside never changed. Now she’s gone and the house is mine and it’s October—Halloween is a week away and the memory seems like yesterday. I was nine years old and Halloween was only seven days away. I looked into the water of the Mohawk River one day and it was black. The kind of black you see when there’s a bad storm overhead and the shadows of the clouds are reflected in the river. Only there was no storm overhead and the sky was blue. I closed my eyes then looked again but the water didn’t change—just stayed black. “Mama, why is the water so dark?” “Dark? What do you mean, dark? It just like it’s always been, Sammy.” “No Mama, it’s black. Come and see.” I was standing in the doorway of our little brick house and Mama was stirring something on the stove. “In a minute, Sammy. This is almost done then I’ll walk down with you. Is it warm outside?” “Yes Mama.” The water had looked … swollen. Like something was there, just under the surface. I closed the door. “Okay Sammy I’m finished—let’s go.” “Maybe we should wait, Mama. I’m kind of tired.” “Oh c’mon sweetie—I want to go and you have to keep me company. Besides, you’re too young to be tired.” Mama reached for my hand and smiled—that special smile that always made everything seem all right. “Are you thinking about the story Mr. Toby told you? It’s just pretend, Sammy. There’s nothing that comes out of the water—it’s all made up.” But I held on tight as we walked down the path. “See, Sammy? There’s nothing wrong with the river. The water’s blue, not black.” And it was. It even felt normal again. Mama and I lived a half mile away from the school bus stop—down a short road bordered by trees to the first bend and along a narrow dirt road that went past a row of homes facing the river. Our house sat at the end of another short road, out of sight of the water. On my way home I was usually greeted by Daisy, the little pug dog that lived on the first corner. She would run down the drive and launch herself straight into my arms. The first time she did it she knocked me down and sat on my chest, grinning. On this day I rounded the bend and looked for her but she was nowhere in sight. I went on home, disappointed. “Mama, Daisy wasn’t there today. Do you think she’s sick?” “I don’t know, Sammy. Maybe she’s sniffing around somewhere—I think I saw her by the river earlier. She likes to dig. She’s probably still there. Change your clothes, honey, and take out the trash. Then you can play until supper.” “Sammy!” The voice belonged to my friend Eric, pedaling toward me on his bike. “Watcha doin’? Hey, I found a cool cave in the woods by the river. C’mon—I’ll show ya. I tried to see inside but it’s too dark. Today I brought a flashlight.” He parked his bike and we took off on foot down the path. It hit me as soon as we rounded the bend—the water—inky, black. I stopped. “Eric! Look at the river!” “C’mon! I wanna show ya this cave.” He kept going, getting further ahead. I stood rooted, watching the water move—rippling, swelling, then smoothing again. Like something was there, trying to escape. “Eric!” Panic made my feet fly. “Look at this, Sammy.” He was poking around in the brush, shining the flashlight. My heart was thudding against my rib cage. Imagination, I thought. Nothing can live underwater except fish. Eric and I soon discovered his cave was no more than a deep depression under a bank. We wandered around for a while, climbed an old tree with thick arms then walked back the way we came. When we reached the river, it was blue again—like the sky. Imagination. “Sammy, what do you want to be for Halloween?” Mama asked. “Let’s do something different this year. I was thinking—how about going as a creature that came from the river? You can pretend to be Mr. Toby’s monster. We’ll do you up really scary—I’ll make you a neat costume. What do you say?” Mama’s costumes were the best—no one ever guessed who I was. There were about ten of us that went from door to door—kids from our small neighborhood and the nearby town of Fairlee. She was looking at me, waiting for my answer and I wanted to tell her no—I wanted to say that I didn’t want to go trick or treating this year. Not after dark. Not by the river. Maybe I was too old. I told her that. “No, you’re not. Anyway, all your friends are going. Tell you what. I’ll surprise you, okay?” She smiled at me and busied herself at her favorite pastime—cooking. The river seemed to turn blacker. I tried not to look at it but couldn’t seem to help myself. My young mind began to wander along impossible roads. Images of misshapen creatures emerging from the water and creeping through the grass kept my attention riveted on the waters’ edge. It was Wednesday. Halloween was Friday. Daisy still hadn’t shown up and Eric’s dog, Mutt, didn’t come home last night. Then the wind started. “Sammy, be careful on the way to the bus stop this morning. It’s getting windy and things can drop on you from the trees.” “What things, Mama?” Visions of bats as big as hawks popped into my head. “You know, pine cones, or nuts—even limbs that have broken off but not yet fallen. Walk down the road, not under the trees.” She hugged me and pushed me out the door. “Scoot. You’ll miss your bus.” I stood on the steps and looked down our short road. Maybe I could cut through the woods behind the houses so I wouldn’t have to walk by the river. Mama raised the window. “Sammy, is something wrong? You’d better get moving—the bus driver won’t wait for you.” “Okay Mama, I’m going.” The notion of the woods was discarded—I’d probably get lost and Mama would skin me alive. A short while later I was running along the road by the river, keeping a watchful eye on the water. Just as I turned toward the road where the school bus stopped, something caught my eye. A form, like an outline. It seemed to be filled with liquid, undulating over the ground. What I heard was a splash, like the sound water makes when Mama empties a bucket out the door. What I saw was a face—Daisy’s face—only bigger. A lot bigger. I ran for the bus. “Sammy,” said Mrs. Sanders, “you don’t seem to be with us today. Are you feeling all right? Would you like to go to the nurse’s office?” ""No Mrs. Sanders. I’m okay.” I buried my nose in my book without seeing the words. The day lasted forever, and was over too soon. Then the bus was stopping, the door was opening—and I had to walk by the river. I descended the steps and my cap became airborne, flying to the other side of the road. By the time I captured it the bus was gone and I stood alone. Tree limbs thrashed as the wind picked up its assault, growing more intense with each passing moment. It swirled around me and turned cold—I closed my eyes against its fury. Then, as if someone turned off a switch, it stopped—leaving me in silence surrounded by air so dead it reeked. The sound started a long way off—a thin wail. As it came closer it grew louder and louder—like a scream rushing through a tunnel, echoing off the sides—and it was right on top of me. I was crouched on the ground and I was crying when I realized everything was normal again—it was quiet. When I stood, my knees bumped together and I leaned against the trunk of a tree until my legs decided to support my weight. I forced myself to walk, concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other. The turn in the road beckoned. My feet seemed to grow heavier until I could hardly lift them. I reached the corner in front of the house where Daisy lived—nothing was in sight. The short road spread out in front of me, leaves tumbling along the ground pursued by the relentless wind. I stayed as close to the houses as possible. Halfway home. Then—something was behind me, getting louder, coming fast. Visions of dogs’ faces with long yellow fangs—huge heads floating on air, stretching toward me from behind made my spine prickle. I ran. I wanted to scream, but it came out a whisper. “Hey Sammy! Wait up!” Eric’s voice jumped at me as his bike skidded to a halt. My legs turned to jelly and I sat hard, dropping my book bag beside me. He laughed. “Watcha doin’ down there? How come you’re not home yet? I beacha today. C’mon. Let’s do something. Sammy! Get up—ya gonna sit there all day?” He hopped back on his bike and took off toward my house. I scrambled to my feet and followed as fast as my rubber legs would allow. “Did Mutt come home?” I asked as we walked toward the woods. “Nah. Stupid dog probably got caught in a trap someplace. Pop says it’d serve him right—can’t never stay home. I kinda miss him, tho—was hopin’ he’d come back.” He shrugged. “Eric, if I ask you something promise you won’t laugh?” “What?” “Did you ever see anything—you know—funny, by the water?” “Like what?” “Do you remember the story Mr. Toby told us?” “You mean ‘bout animals 'n things disappearing and coming out of the water? D’ya think that happened to Mutt? Nah! That’s just dumb stuff. He was tryin’ to scare us. ‘Sides, the river looks the same.” “I saw it turn black.” “You did? How come I didn’t?” “I don’t know Eric, but he said not everybody could see it. He said it only happens every nine years and a girl disappeared last time and the water turns dark and this is the ninth year … ” “Ah—you’re just seein’ things. None of that other stuff is true. Stop bein’ a sissy, Sammy—forget it. Let’s go climb one of them big trees. Wouldncha like to make a tree house? Then we could see everything—nothin’ could ever sneak up on us. I found a good one in the woods next to the river. Some of the branches hang over—c’mon, I’ll show ya. You can climb right out over the water and look down.” He ran off ahead—he always did that. Once he made up his mind to do something, he was impatient to be doing it. I was forever trying to keep up with him. “Ain’t it neat?” He was staring up at a gnarled old tree that looked like it could fall into the river at any moment. “C’mon. I climbed it yesterday and you can see under water when the sun shines right.” He caught a low branch and swung himself up, then turned and put his hand down to me. I realized I had avoided looking to see what color the water was. He scrambled upward and I ventured a small glance toward the wet expanse and was relieved to see that it looked blue. “Eric, wait for me. What if you fall in?” “I can swim—can’t you?” “Well, I guess so—they taught us at camp last summer. But I never go swimming. Do you?” “Nah. But ya never forget once it’s learned. Lookit down there. Didn’t I tell ya?” We grinned at our twins in the water. As I looked, a gust of wind tried to dislodge me from the branch I was wrapped around and my reflection disappeared as the water turned inky. A light spot seemed to appear where my face had been and a wavy shape began threading slowly through it. It swirled around and around, holding my gaze, hypnotic, pulling at me. I hugged the branch so tight my arms hurt. “Eric!” I whispered. “Can you see what that is?” “What? Jeez Sammy, there’s nothing there—just our faces. C’mon—let’s walk down the bank a ways and see if there’s even a better tree.” He began backing down the thick trunk—I was still frozen in place with my eyes closed. “Whatsa matter Sammy—need help?” I half-opened my eyes and squinted at the water beneath me. It was blue again and the only thing in it was my reflection. I scurried down before it could change its mind. That night the wind sounded like it was trying to blow the house down. “Mama, are you sure nothing can live underwater but fish?” “Not for long, sweetie. Maybe snails, or plants, or things like that. Are you still thinking about that story?” “No, I was just wondering. Did you get my costume done?” “Almost. It’ll be finished when you get home from school. I have to stitch the bottom, then I’ll be through. It’s a surprise. You’re going to love it, I promise.” Thursday morning I hurried along the narrow road bordering the river. The wind was still trying to steal my cap. As I rounded the bend toward the bus stop, there was a noise from the edge of the water. I was afraid to look, and afraid not to. Around the corner I went, turned without stopping and walked backwards up the road as I tried to identify the sound. Something ran between the trees. Something big, like Mr. Bailey’s mule. Maybe it got loose. I stopped moving. It came around the front of the tree. Not a mule—a dog. It was Mutt, or almost Mutt—colors seemed to ripple inside the water-filled shape. It was coming toward me on stilted legs, its lip curled. I couldn’t move. It was at the edge of the road when the horn blew. I jumped and yelled, then turned and ran. When I looked back from the safety of the bus, there was nothing there. Had there ever been? Halloween morning the sky was gray. Mama was making cream of wheat and toast, my favorite breakfast. “Morning Sammy. Are you excited about trick or treating? Oh—Tim and Margie are sick so there’ll just be you and Eric from here. Danny Carol’s mom is going to bring the rest of them over. The wind isn’t blowing quite as hard this morning, maybe by tonight it’ll stop. Last night it would’ve blown the masks right off your faces. Here—sit and eat your breakfast. You don’t want to miss your bus.” She smiled at me and walked out of the kitchen. The only place the wind was blowing hard was by the water. I ran all the way to the bus stop, never looking anywhere except straight ahead. If anything was there, I didn’t want to see it. Maybe if I didn’t look, it wouldn’t look either. After school I ran all the way home from the bus stop. Mama was putting the ironing board away and I could see the colors of my costume draped over a chair. It was a mixture of yellows, rusts, grays and blacks covered with matted fur. Closer inspection revealed long pants and sleeves, with paws on the ends of all four. It also had a tail. It looked more like a wet dog than a monster from the water. “Mama, what’s it supposed to be?” “My own creation. We’ll call it a water dog. And it has a special face. Wait ‘til you see!” She went into her bedroom and came out carrying something. “Here—close your eyes so I can slip it on. Then you can look in the mirror.” I stood quietly as she put the soft mask over my head. “Okay. That came out great. You’ll fool them all. Go on and look.” I walked over to the mirror and Daisy’s pug face stared back at me. I yanked it off. “Sammy? What’s the matter, hon? Don’t you like it? I know how much you like Daisy—I thought you’d be pleased.” “Mama, Daisy never came back.” Her voice was soft when she answered. “Oh Sammy—I’m sorry. I didn’t know.” She paused. “Maybe she wandered into the woods and a bigger animal got her. It happens around here—you know that. She was so little. Honey, you don’t have to wear the costume. We can dress you up in old clothes … ” “No Mama, I like it—really. It just made me feel sort of funny for a minute. It’s a great costume.” I didn’t tell her about seeing Daisy, or Mutt—she’d say I was imagining things. Maybe I was. No one else saw them, or saw the river turn to ink, or whatever was in the water. “Hi Eric. Gee, you look great.” “Thanks. I made it myself.” He was wearing a pair of his dad’s coveralls and an old hat, his face painted with lipstick. Mama came into the room. “Hello Eric. You guys ready to go? Mrs. Carol should be here soon—it’s almost dark. Why don’t you wait for them outside?” We sat on the steps listening to the wind in the tree branches. From somewhere in the woods came the sound of something heavy crashing to the ground. Eric grinned at me. “This is a great night, huh Sammy? Spooky, like Halloween should be. Maybe there’ll be bats flyin’ around!” I didn’t tell him that spooky wasn’t exactly what I wanted, or that I didn’t want to do this at all. Eric wasn’t afraid of anything. We sat and watched the night creep up on us while we waited for Mrs. Carol. Then Mama came to the door. “Boys—Mr. Carol just called. Mrs. Carol’s car stalled a couple of blocks from their house and won’t start. They can’t make it, so why don’t you guys go to a few houses around here? I can go with you, if you’d like.” “No way! We’re not babies!” Mama laughed at Eric’s indignation. “I kind of thought you’d feel that way. All right then, but don’t be gone too long or I promise I’ll come looking for you.” She handed us both sacks and went back into the house. Eric, with his usual speed, took off down the path. The wind stirred the darkness and I hustled to catch up with him. “Listen!” Eric said. “Hear that? Sounds like a dog howlin’. Maybe it’s Mr. Toby’s ghost.” The sound carried on the wind, getting louder, then falling to a whisper. He glanced at me and shivered. “C’mon, let’s go. It really is spooky! Wish Mutt was with us.” A vision of Mutt as big as a mule came into my mind as we headed to the first house. “Trick or Treat!” “Oh you boys look so cute,” Mrs. Justin gushed. Eric looked at me and rolled his eyes. She dropped a handful of candy into our bags, we thanked her and left. “Let’s just do these houses and go back,” I said. “I don’t want to go by the river.” “Why not?” said Eric. “That’s where we get our best stuff. Stop being a scaredy cat.” “I am not!” A fleeting thought about leaving him alone was soon forgotten when I looked into the black night. “Okay,” I said, listening to the thrashing trees, “but let’s go. Maybe that wasn’t a dog.” As if on cue, the mournful sound began again. Eric frowned, making me laugh. All the lipstick across his forehead made him look as if he were smiling upside down. We were both giggling as we turned the corner. The apparition seemed to come out of nowhere. It was in the middle of the road. “Jeez! Do you see it?” My voice came out like a croak. “Whadya think I’m blind? ‘Course I see it. Sorta looks like Mutt, but it’s too big. What’ll we do?” We stood still, leaning against each other, when whatever it was lay down in the road and put its huge head on its paws. “There’s another one! Looks like Daisy!” His voice was hushed. It walked over next to the Mutt thing and sat, watching us. Eric looked at them, then at me. “That one looks like you,” he whispered. Only then did I remember what I was wearing. The Daisy thing was looking at me with its head cocked to one side. “Eric, they’re all wet, like they came out of the water.” They watched us. We were afraid to look away. “We could back up real slow. Maybe they’ll stay there and we can get to your house. Try it.” One foot, then another, and another … the Mutt thing stood. We stopped, clutching each other. I must have made a noise—Eric jabbed me. We were shaking so hard our teeth chattered. “We gotta run,” I said. “We can’t stay here.” “They’ll get us. Look how big they are. I’m sorry I called ya a scaredy cat.” His voice was thick. “Maybe they’re not real. C’mon, just turn and run toward my house. Don’t stop and don’t look back. Run as fast as you can.” The Daisy thing sat and the Mutt thing looked at it. “Wait! Maybe it’ll lay down again. Then we run. Okay?” “Okay,” he said, his tone quavery. We stood there while time stopped. Finally the Mutt thing lowered itself to the ground. My hand tightened on Eric’s arm. The Daisy thing stood, sniffed the air toward us, then lay in the road. “Now!” I said, and ran. I could hear Eric’s footsteps thudding right behind me. Then all I could hear was my own blood pounding in my ears to the beat of my heart. I never once looked back. All that happened eighteen years ago. I don’t remember the following months. Mama left the river and took me to her sister’s. They said it was a long time before I spoke again. The next summer trees were cleared and a new road was built on the other side of the houses by the river. The old dirt road disappeared beneath the weeds—a place where strange shadows sometimes appeared. Shadows, like wet animals—and once, a young boy. Mama went back to live in the little brick house when I turned sixteen—I stayed with my aunt. I never go out after dark during Halloween weeks. My friend Eric? No one knows. He disappeared that long ago night—without a trace. ",candidate00008
15,00002,candidate00008,"HARD EYES GLITTERED as they watched the dim figure behind the wheel. That long ago night, never forgotten. She would be the same – older, but that same contrived innocence as before. He touched the spot that she had touched – the scar that started below his right eye, curved downward, trailed along his chin. No feeling, as if his hand was touching someone else. The car door opened slowly, foot hesitant as it touched the ground. When she closed the door he barely heard the sound. She approached, eyes wide in the moonlight, the flashlight in her hand still off. At the steps she stopped, looked down at them for a moment – straightened her body and climbed onto the porch. Her hand reached for the doorknob. A grin split his face. His time had come at last. This time, she would not leave. … 1988… It was almost hypnotic, driving along this dark country road. Trees bordered the road on the right with the occasional farmhouse appearing on the left. I switched on the car radio and the first thing I heard was a song from my youth. Donna’s face appeared in my thoughts. We were so different – she with her pretty blond hair and brown eyes, me with dark hair and blue eyes. She was confident and I always worried about everything. Donna used to tell me that was fine, “You keep me out of trouble Sara” she’d say, “you keep me safe” and she’d hug me. Our parents first met at the hospital the night we were born and we had been best friends ever since. I loved her dearly and couldn’t image life without her. Today we’d both be thirty-six. She’s been gone for twenty years and I still missed her. I needed to close my eyes. Next pull off…and there it was! Doors locked, I sat looking at my surroundings. So quiet. The moon hung low and pale and yellow, throwing shadows across the landscape. This place looked familiar. Something had happened here long ago, and now it was trying to surface from the bottom of forgotten memories. Déjà vu. My one true experience had been at an old cabin in a clearing in the woods. These woods. My friends disappeared from that cabin twenty years ago. I stopped the thought, closed my eyes, drifted…dreamt… Laughter drifted up from across the years – voices I knew, friends from high school. All except Bill. He was Donna’s. He was also older and taboo. Donna didn’t care – she was mad about him and I couldn’t figure out why. He was tall and thin and always had grease under his nails. That was okay, but he never looked clean. Like he didn’t bathe often. But we put up with it – he had a car! There were four of us – driving along, laughing, passing cigarettes back and forth and sharing bottles of beer. All except me. I didn’t like the taste and said so. They made fun of me at first – tried to get me to drink but I never would. The radio blared country music and we all sang along. I was sixteen and in heaven. Donna was my exact opposite – wild where I was timid, brave where I was shy, defiant where I was obedient. I was not like them. But they accepted me. Night quiet shrouded the fields, the road, the trees. Not even the insects made noise. Wide awake now, I reached for the key, started the engine and shifted out of ‘park’. That’s when I saw it – the road that lead to the old cabin. I was parked on it. I began to pull away and the car stalled. It never stalled. I turned the key, the engine roared into life. Once again, I eased down the shifting lever, stepped on the gas pedal. The tires spun and the car swung sideways. When it stopped, I was looking into the dirt road. I sat, staring into that dark tunnel. Something was propelling me, or the car. “Okay. The car doors are locked, I won’t get out – just drive ahead a few feet.” “I want to show you guys something really neat. I found this old cabin a while ago. We could come here and have parties. Have ta clean it up some, y’know – probably got animals living in it. It’s kind of falling down in spots – have ta be careful.” Bill’s voice, hollow, coming from that place in my mind. The road curved, light glinted through the trees. The sun was high and warm that day as we barreled through those woods. “Almost there. Look! You can see it – right between those trees!” Right between those trees. I came out in a clearing, bright in the moonlight. There it was, just like that day from my past. The cabin sat forlorn, it’s back to the woods, its front looking at me, waiting. The feeling came rushing back – squeezing my throat, making it hard to breathe. The door yawned open. I felt it pulling at me, like it did before. I wouldn’t go in. I didn’t want to go in then, either. “C’mon Sara. You’re such a chickenshit.” Donna, trying to get me out of the car. “Maybe we’ll just leave you home next time. Jeez. It’s just an old, broken down cabin. Probably nobody lived in it for a hundred years. You baby!” I watched them all go inside. I felt miserable. They were right. Just a cabin. So I got out of the car and walked toward the steps leading up to the small porch. When my foot touched the bottom step, the first vision came. I was going to walk into a living room, then into a small kitchen through a doorway at the far end of that living room. There would be a sofa along the left wall – plaid, with rounded arms, across from a long wooden table centered between two windows. Then came the color – red, bright – and wet. I really didn’t want to go in. “Come on!” Donna poked her head through the open door. “ Jeez. I’ll never be able to live this down, y’know. Why do you have to be like this? There’s nothing inside ‘cept broken down furniture. It’s really neat. We could maybe form a club and this could be our club house. Betcha nobody even knows it’s here. Will you come on?” She whirled around, disappeared behind the door. I followed, reluctantly. Inside everything was just where I knew it would be. There were two floors. Narrow steps lead up to tiny bedrooms under a low ceiling. Not much – more of a loft than a second floor. Downstairs in the kitchen a wooden table lay on its side, one leg missing. “Somebody knows it’s here,” I said, pointing to cigarette butts in the corner. “They been there forever,” Donna said. “The only thing here is animals… hey! I got a great idea. Let’s spend a night here! We could bring food, sleeping bags … it’d be a kick!” “We can’t do that. Our parents would never let us.” “Oh Sara, we could too. Just tell them we’re sleeping over each other’s house. You know they don’t check any more. We been doing that forever anyway and besides, I’m sixteen now. That’s almost grown up. ‘N so are you. Hey guys!” She let out a shriek and left me standing there. She didn’t have to convince anyone – they all loved it. Maybe I could get sick. The trunk had as much junk food as would fit between the sleeping bags. The four of us – Bill, Donna, Jeannie and me – we had been here twice now and the cabin was as clean as possible, considering the shape it was in. We carted the food inside and piled it in the middle of the small living room. Next in came the sleeping bags, which we spread on the floor in a circle. Weak sunlight was streaking low and long through the window, causing dust to float around us. “Anybody want a beer?” Bill’s voice came from outside, the last word punctuated by the heavy sound of his booted foot. He stepped through the doorway, grinning, looked at each of us in turn. The light did something to his mouth – broken teeth, that’s all I saw. No one spoke for a moment, then Donna reached for the bottle in his outstretched hand. That’s when we heard it. Upstairs something fell. But it was the sound – half moan, half growl – pain, or anger – not quite human. The quiet that followed sent chills through me. We all stood there staring up at the dark opening. I don’t think anyone was breathing. I remember the wind starting, just a breeze, then harder. It came through the window, caught the door, slammed it behind Bill. It was getting dark and we didn’t have a flashlight. I know, because we looked on the ride up. It got dark so fast that long-ago night. We were all together and then there was only me. Where had they gone? The door was slightly open now and the cabin wanted me. It had waited all these years. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched as I stepped out of the car. My imagination? Probably just the darkness. I pulled the old wooden door open. Cre-e-ech! The noise, right out of a sci-fi movie. I turned on the flashlight and made myself look inside. “I must be nuts.” Shoulders back, I shone the light farther into the room, stepped inside. It was empty. A slight breeze tickled my legs and I pulled the door closed, remembering Bill’s grin and broken teeth. “Enough! Breathe – in, out – in, out…” My pulse slowed and I shone the flashlight up the stairs. The beam created weird dancing shadows on the dark wall. “What is up there? Did I go upstairs that night? Why can’t I remember?” I walked into the kitchen and it, too, was empty. Back in the living room I again looked up the stairway. Low ceilings, dirty walls – I raised the light beam higher. That’s when I saw the color. Red. Smeared, like finger painting. It came out of the room, ended halfway down the staircase. Blood. The flashlight slipped. Pulse racing, I raised the light. A shadow passed through the beam – fleeting, gone. Adrenaline pumping, I turned, yanked open the door and ran for the car. My fingers were shaking so badly I dropped the keys twice before I could get them into the ignition. The engine screamed, I jammed the shift lever down. The car shot backwards. “Shit!” I drove the brake pedal to the floor, shoved the lever back up and hit the gas pedal hard. The quiet that filled the small space was louder than the engine had been. And then I did it again. This time the only response was the feeble turning of a flooded engine. That’s when I knew. I was going to spend the night here looking at the yawning mouth of that cabin. And whatever, or whoever, was inside would be looking back. I locked the doors, reclined the seat slightly so I could see outside – just in case. “I won’t go to sleep, just rest. When it turns light the car will start. If it doesn’t I’ll walk!"" … 1908… There was just the two of them – a women and a little girl. The woman was pretty – soft oval face and blue eyes – Sara’s eyes. Her clothes were different – from a time gone before. Dark hair piled on top of her head, she was wearing a long dress that swirled around slender legs. The bodice had small buttons that stopped just beneath her chin. She stood, shading her eyes, looking toward the forest. “Jennie!”… a pause… “Jennifer Sarah! Where are you?” “Here, Mama.” The little girl came running from the woods. Her small face was ringed with curls and long dark braids bounced behind her as she ran. Jennifer Sarah was eight years old and loved everything she came into contact with. Animals would come up to her as if she was one with them. “Jennifer, I told you not to go in those woods. It isn’t safe. Why don’t you ever listen?” “It’s okay Mama. Really. Just animals and they like me. Can we go now?” She was standing on the porch of a small cabin nestled in the trees as her daughter, the only thing in life that mattered, narrowed the space between them, finally wrapping herself around her mother’s legs. She laughed and hugged the little girl. “Yes - I need a few things in town. You sit here while I hitch the horse up to the cart. Don’t you run off – I don’t want to be looking for you again. We need to go so we can get back before dark. Okay?” “Okay.” She smiled her consent up into her mother’s eyes. … 1988… In my dream the clearing was sunlit and the cabin looked new. A slight breeze moved a wooden rocker that sat on the porch. A row of yellow flowers bordered both sides of the steps. A few feet behind the cabin, by the woods, stood a small structure with one door. Awake now, I was looking at a cabin that was old and in disrepair – standing alone in the overgrown clearing. The daylight seemed to stop at the edge of the woods. “I should just leave.” It crossed my mind, but my hand was already opening the car door. They used a horse and wagon in my dream. There was no electricity and no running water, so there must be a well someplace. My great-great grandmother had lived in a place like this. Something had happened to her. I felt it, but it wasn’t clear. Like the memory wasn’t mine, but was in my head. I straightened my body and began the walk toward the woods. The path appeared soon after I entered the shaded glade. I moved slowly, ready to turn and run – just in case my legs refused to obey. Farther in, I could see a space that looked brighter where the path went around a tree. And I knew what I would find. Graves, most of them marked with crude moss-covered stones. All except two mounds, marked with wooden crosses that had the remnants of what was probably names scratched on them – now mostly illegible. I stood looking around this small open area. Something was wrong. It should have been overgrown but it was neat. There were no weeds between the graves. I couldn’t stop looking over my shoulder as I walked out of the woods. When I reached the cabin I didn’t hesitate. I knew I would go in, climb the stairs and look in the upstairs rooms. They held the key to whatever happened, and I had to know. Now it felt different inside – almost like…coming home. When I looked around the living room I could see the sofa with the round arms and the table across from it. In the kitchen, I stood still, closed my eyes and inhaled deeply. Food. It was on the long shelf and there was a woman standing with her back to me. She turned and smiled at me. I reached out – she was so close. When I opened my eyes, the room was empty. I had the strangest feeling that I had lived here once. I didn’t believe in reincarnation – but now… A friend had given me an exercise – a way to help me remember things I buried in my mind. “Sit in a quiet place, close your eyes, let your thoughts flow. Never dwell on one memory. Go backwards, ever backwards.” The idea was to take me back to places time had blurred. It had worked for me before, why not now? I retrieved a blanket from the car, spread it out in the kitchen below the window and made myself as comfortable as possible. I closed my eyes, let my mind drift. Family – Mom – the last get-together with Grandmother Jen before her death. Conversations about the past. Dad’s frowning face. I wanted to stay up that night but mom insisted I go to bed. I couldn’t sleep. I got up, crept out to the landing, crouched in the corner. I knew I must be very quiet. Mom would make me go back to bed if she caught me. Soft music drifted up the stairs, then my father’s voice. “Don’t bring all that old stuff up again, Evie. What good can it do?” “I didn’t bring it up. Mom did and she likes to talk about it. The past is the only thing she can remember clearly – she can’t even remember getting up this morning. Let her talk. What can it hurt?” “Well you certainly don’t want Sara to hear this stuff. She has nightmares as it is. Imagine her hearing about a family murder. We’d have to put her in therapy. Besides, no one ever knew for sure what happened. He just disappeared.” “Sara’s in bed, Ken. She’s been up there almost an hour and it doesn’t take her long to fall asleep.” I could visualize Dad looking up the stairway and I almost went back to my room, but curiosity held me. A murder? In our family? “Evelyn, you have to make sure you write all this stuff down and keep it”. Grandmother’s voice. “It’s our family’s history and Sara has a right to know. And I can too remember getting up this morning.” Her voice had a hurt quality, rarely heard from this once strong woman. “I’m sorry Mom – I didn’t mean to hurt you.” “Well, you did.” Grandmother’s voice shook. Everyone knew she was forgetful and hard of hearing. Normally she missed a lot of conversation. Not that night, though. She spoke again. “I think it’s colorful, that’s what I think. Well, most of it anyway. All that other stuff – about a spirit – I don’t believe any of it. Besides, none of the family even knows where that old place is.” I jerked upright, reflection broken. “That’s why this is so familiar! My great-great grandparents lived here! How in the world did I ever end up here – of all places!” Goose bumps raised on my arms. The past had somehow pulled me here, to this cabin. A horrible thing had happened – and I was meant to know. I wouldn’t give up. I leaned back, closed my eyes again. Grandmother Jen’s voice. “Sara was named after her you know – your great grandmother, only her name was spelled with an ‘h’ on the end.” “I know, Mom.” “It was tragic, really tragic. My mother watched my grandmother endure so much. That night – all the noise up there. Mother tried to ignore it. After a while she just couldn’t take it any longer. She told me all of this before she died. I can still see her face when she was telling me – it looked like she was back there. Grandmother sat her down and told her not to move, then ran out of the kitchen and up the stairs. The next thing she heard was screaming, screaming, scream…"" … 1908… Her mother was screaming. Something was wrong. She ran up the stairs, into the bedroom. Her father was hitting her mother and she was bleeding. Jennifer yelled at him to “Stop, stop, stop. You’re hurting Mama.” There was a revolver lying on the bed. … 1988… When I opened my eyes I was standing in the middle of the empty bedroom. Empty of everything – except… I felt it – an energy – pushing into my mind. A pressure that built in intensity, invading my head. I had to get out of this room! My feet wouldn’t move. I was smothering – there was no air! It took all of my will power to break free. I ran down the stairs, straight through the doorway – yanked open the car door. My foot was on the gas pedal even before I sat. I jammed the pedal down, twisted the ignition key. The engine screamed, roared into life – died. Before my mind caught up with my actions I did it again – this time, to silence. I sat, my hand still twisting the key, my foot on the gas pedal, tight to the floor. Finally I made my body relax, put my head down on the steering wheel and closed my eyes. Deep breathes, over and over, until the pounding inside my chest slowed. “I have to stay.” In my mind I knew that if I left now, whatever was in that upstairs room would never rest. “One more night. It’s the cabin – it wants me to know. I’ll do the exercise again. I’m close and I can do this. I can! I will!” I sat in the safety of the car a little longer, then got out and returned to the cabin. There was no feeling here in the downstairs rooms. I stood looking up the stairway, slowly started the climb. The feeling began when I was almost at the top. “Wait! Not yet. Later. I’ll come up later.” Outside once more, the sweet scent of pine filled the warm air. Noises of the forest and the sounds of life beyond my vision soothed me. I sat on the steps, let my body relax. In the back seat of the car there was water and a few Granola bars. I carried these, along with another blanket, inside the cabin. The night ahead would be long. The day passed slowly, and yet it seemed twilight came too soon. Stretched out on the blankets I watched the shadows grow longer. Now, there was only weak light shining from the pale moon as it rose above the trees. I closed my eyes, drifted – lulled by the songs of the night creatures… … 1908… “Here, take it.” He was holding the revolver toward her. “You need to know how to use it. We live in a place where it’s possible to get hurt, either from animals or people who want to take what you have. You have to be able to defend yourself.” Jennie took the gun out of his hand very gingerly. “I don’t like guns, Papa. ‘Sides, animals won’t hurt me – I’m their friend.” “Well maybe all of them don’t know that.” “It’s heavy and I’m scared.” “Jennifer, once you know how it works you won’t be afraid of it. What if your mama and me are gone and somebody comes to the door. What would you do? You know not everybody is good.” She looked at her papa and knew what he was talking about. After all, he wasn’t so good all the time. He hit her mama. “I could run and hide” this, timidly. “That might not work. You could be found. Now c’mon. You never have to touch it unless you feel scared and we’re not home. Or maybe I’m not home and someone is trying to hurt Mama. You could help her. Your mama and me – we don’t want anything to happen to you…"" … 1988… Thump! Upstairs. It invaded the dream. I woke holding my breath. Thump!! Fear – a bolt of electricity. It started at the top of my head, shot down my body. “Sarah. Sarah! Come up.” The words, in my mind. Low at first, then urgent – coming from that upstairs room. I didn’t move, couldn’t breathe. The words came louder. I stood on legs of rubber. “If I don’t move maybe it’ll…” The sound grew louder still, as if reading my thoughts. I forced myself to walk, stopped at the bottom of the stairs. When I looked up, that doorway looked like an open mouth, waiting to devour me. I backed up. “Sarah!!” My legs gave way and I sat, hard. The sound was a wailing wind, crashing into my mind, breaking barriers, opening passages into forgotten places. I moved forward, then upward until I reached the top of that long, long stairway. What little moonlight there was stopped just outside the bedroom door. The dark inside was an abyss of pure evil. I crossed the threshold. “I’m here. Who are you? Where did you come from? What do you want?” He spoke inside my head. “You know who I am. I pass into the minds of males. That’s why I brought the man here. When it’s time, I discard their bodies.” “Did you hurt him – hurt my friends?” “No, he did, the man named Bill. But I helped him bury them – showed him where. He is still waiting.” “What do you mean…” I grabbed my head as the sound, deafening, burst into me. “NO MORE QUESTIONS. Now you will listen. What she did was not right. She wanted the child all to herself – she wanted me to go. She had to be punished. She would have learned. The three of us could have all been together as a family. She couldn’t see it was her that was wrong – she should have taken her punishment. But no! She chose to end me! She killed me! You were too young the last time, but now you are back and you are one with her! You must pay for her sins!” His voice filled my head, circled around and around, words echoing, growing louder, louder… Then I was on the floor. The push felt like the force of a gale. I was lifted, flew through the air, hit the wall, fell. He came again and I rolled. The noise of his rage sliced through the cold air as he pushed. I hit the opposite wall. The doorway, lit by pale moonlight, penetrated the haze in my mind. I rolled toward the light. Before I reached it, I was airborne. Stunned, disoriented – I knew I wouldn’t last much longer. The next time I felt him coming, I tensed. When he lifted me, I dove out into the hall. His rage, a crescendo, roared behind me. I pulled myself out of the room and half crawled, half fell down the stairway. At the bottom I lay still, eyes closed, my mind – reeling. And there was silence, blessed silence. Moonlight was shining through the window and the feeling of rage was gone – for now. I stood up, reached for the outside doorknob, turned it. Nothing happened. With both hands wrapped around that knob, I twisted and yanked. It was stuck. I would have to climb through a window. The only one large enough was in the kitchen. I reached for the partially open top window, pushed it up all the way. With my hands on the bottom sill, I started to lift myself. Something slammed down onto the back of my hand – the pain, excruciating. There was nothing in the window. I held on to the ache, reached up again. The same thing happened. This time the pain floored me. I cradled my hand, rocked back and forth. It felt like it was smashed. And I realized I would not be allowed to leave until this – whatever it was – was finished. There was no rage downstairs. I sank down onto the blanket. It would soon be daylight – then I’d figure it out. Sun on my face woke me. I felt disoriented, achy. The night’s events came quickly back and I raised up on one elbow, winced, lay back down. My body did not want to move. Through half-closed eyes I gazed out at the expanse of floor – uneven old floorboards – like wood gets when there’s too much water… I sat up, suddenly wide awake. The floorboard in the corner. It was slightly higher than the others, as if it had been taken up and put back into place – but not quite. Probably nothing, but I walked over, ran my foot across the top. It was raised high enough to be over the side of my shoe. I reached down, pulled on the board. It didn’t move. Upon closer inspection, I could see pry marks. I pulled up again, with no luck. “Probably just old wood.” I went back to the window. Where it had been open last night, it was now closed. I tried pushing it up but it wouldn’t budge. The front door produced the same result – still stuck. The cabin was very quiet. When I looked up the stairway, the entrance into the bedroom was dark. “There is no way I’m going back up there! I have to get out of here. There should be another door to the outside.” But there wasn’t. On the far wall in the kitchen there was a line. From where I stood I could see the shape – like that of a small arch. I ran my fingers along it. Maybe this was once an exit. The raised floorboard again caught my attention. I needed a pry. My Swiss army knife! I opened the blade, sat on the floor and slid the knife in under the highest end. I pushed down. It didn’t budge. I forced the blade down farther and tried again. This time, it moved. The next time it moved even easier. Once more and the board popped up. I couldn’t see anything except loose dirt. I reached inside, pushed the blade down into the soil. There was a metallic ‘thunk’. After a few minutes of trying, I pulled out a small metal container with a latch that hooked over a piece of protruding metal, keeping the lid in place. Inside I found a few small pretty stones, an arrowhead, a large copper button. A child’s treasures, hidden beneath a floorboard. On the very bottom there was a folded piece of paper. It was a letter, written in a child’s hand. But it was the contents of that letter. After I read it, I understood. I stood at the doorway of that darkened upstairs bedroom and felt the presence inside. The urge to run, run, run – out the door, away from here was overwhelming. But I had to go into that room – make him understand. It was the only way this would ever end. Somewhere deep inside I knew the cabin would call me back – and if not me, someone else. He would have his revenge. My hand touched the pocket with the letter tucked inside. I closed my eyes, willing him with my mind. I could feel his pull, just beyond the door – wanting, needing me to enter his realm. Without my fear to strengthen him, he had no power. “Just go in. Go in and get it over with. Move now!” The door closed hard behind me. I walked into the center of a tornado. I was lifted, spun around, slammed into the wall. “Stop! Please! Hear me! I have…” The roar cut off the sound of my voice, his anger louder than a freight train. “YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. YOUR ACTIONS SPOKE FOR YOU. NOW YOU WILL PAY!” This time, I stayed on the floor. My arm was yanked, I was spun around and around. With my free arm, I flailed out, screamed at him. “Let go! It wasn’t me! LET GO NOW!!!” And I stopped moving – the noise, now only a jumbled whisper. I jumped to my feet, raised my voice. “I am not her! I am her great-great granddaughter and YOU are my great-great grandfather and you’re trying to hurt me! NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME!” The room was silent, my anger was intense. What was total darkness was now gray – his uncertainty changing the atmosphere. His turmoil swirled around me like a great unrest – but now with hesitation. “There was a letter hidden under a kitchen floorboard. It’s from my great-grandmother, your daughter. Listen while I read it to you.” “I did a bad thing. Mama said I would feel better if I write it down. Papa was hurting Mama and I shot him with a gun. But he told me I could use it if anyone was hurting Mama. He told me I could protect her. He said I could so I did. I don’t know if Papa meant from him, but he was hurting Mama so I did. I loved Papa. Mama said I did good but it doesn’t feel good. I don’t know why Papa hurt Mama but he did – a lot. Mama took Papa in the woods and I helped her because he was heavy. Mama said God would have Papa now. I didn’t know how he’d get him because she made me come back to the house. But I snuck back after Mama came home and Papa was gone so maybe God did take him. I feel really bad about what I did. Maybe Papa can read this and he knows I’m sorry I hurt him but he shouldn’t have been hurting Mama and maybe he knows that too. Mama said I would feel better after I wrote this but I don’t feel better. I miss him and I’m sorry for what I did. Jennie” There was total silence. I stood for a moment, taking in the quiet. The room felt different, no longer disturbed. I turned, walked down the stairs. The cabin door opened and I went outside, breathed deeply of the clean air. The small clearing was sunlit and smelled like pine and flowers. Bird songs and warmth filled the air. For the last time, I went up to the bedroom. Sun was shining through the small window. As I looked around the room, I felt a sense of peace. The feelings of rage were gone, along with my urgency to escape. The car started with the first turn of the key. Once again driving towards home, my thoughts went back to the last couple of hours. “They never told anyone. Once I knew what happened, I found his grave – just a grass-covered mound with no marker. They must have left the cabin soon afterwards.” My glance went down to the tin box on the seat next to me and I vowed to keep her secret. A deep feeling of sadness swept over me. The morning I drove Bill’s car home after that night twenty years ago. So many questions, none of them answered – Donna’s family, Jeanne’s family – the police. I just couldn’t remember. The police had finally found the cabin. They came to the conclusion that Donna and the rest of them had decided to take off together. After all, they were a wild bunch and I wasn’t really like the rest of them. Time passed – their families never let go but the search ended. I’m not sure anyone really believed me, but they accepted my loss of memory. They all watched me pretty closely for a while. I remember I didn’t feel much like talking and I know that worried mom and dad, but eventually things went back to normal. I’m glad I could bring peace to great-great grandfather. There’s still gaps in my memory that I can’t bring back. Déjà vu – if I didn’t believe in it before, I do now. Someday I would return to this place of my ancestors. A quiet cabin – a great place to write our family history. Grandmother Jen would like that. … LATER… The cabin sat, in peace at last. Summer turned to fall, leaves began to drop and the winter came fast and heavy. Wind found its’ way down the path into the woods, circled the graves, rested in a small funnel over the mound by the tree line. Leaves blew into the air, the funnel turned into a swirling black cloud, reversed its’ direction. The cabin door slammed as wind whooshed up the stairway into the bedroom. A scream filled the air for no one to hear. “YOU LEFT ME. COME BACK! BURY ME NEXT TO DONNA! COME BACK! I WILL WAIT AND YOU WILL PAY FOR LEAVING ME UNDONE!!” The maelstrom thrashed around the room, screaming its’ anguish. The room turned dark. Bill’s anger – a whirlwind, entered the walls, burst through, spread outward. I woke with a start. It was warm, soft music was playing. I must have fallen asleep reading. The hour was late – time for bed. I bent down, picked up the book that had slid off my lap, stood upright. A prickling sensation started at the back of my head, went down my spine all the way into my toes. The warm room went cold. I turned, walked toward the bedroom – and stopped. The cabin appeared in my mind, door open, waiting… ",candidate00008
16,00001,unknown,"What a beautiful drive, I thought, as we headed towards Albany and my sister's place. This was what we’d been waiting for — July, 1995 and Bill’s retirement. Upstate New York’s Route 7 runs parallel to Interstate 88, quiet and pretty, with towns dotting the rolling landscape. We both loved living in Florida, but this was a pleasant change. And I hadn’t seen my sister in two years. There was a hard ‘thump’ and shards of glass sprayed the windshield. “Oh my God! Bill! What was that?” “I hit a deer. I caught a glimpse of it as it jumped. Of all the rotten luck!” The town of Worcester was still visible in our rear view mirror as my husband stopped and walked over to the crumpled form of a small spotted deer. “It’s only a fawn,” he said, shaking his head. “Just a baby.” While we were looking at our smashed grill and broken headlight a car pulled up and the driver stepped out. He was tall, heavyset, wearing a dirty coverall. He was chewing on a toothpick clamped between his teeth. Strapped around his waist was a belt, and one of the biggest knives I had ever seen. “Tough luck,” he said, glancing at the animal. “No help for him. Car okay?” Hands jammed in his pockets, he sauntered over and looked at the front of our van. “That there tire’s gonna rub against the fender. Good thing I came along ‘cause you’re gonna need that looked at. You folks just passin’ through?” When we didn’t respond, he shrugged. “Just askin’. Saw you come off the interstate — might be able to help you out. I know a mechanic — not far, either. Does good work and he’ll fix it fast. Where you folks from?” “Where is this mechanic located?” Bill asked, again ignoring his question. “Back there a couple miles.” He was gesturing behind him. “You just follow me. I’ll take you to his place.” He started toward his car. “Bill!” They both turned and when the stranger looked at me his eyes seemed to narrow. Bill came back to where I stood. “I don’t like this,” I whispered. “Let’s go on to my sister’s — we’ll be careful.” “That’s at least a hundred miles, Sue. I might be able to pull that fender out, but if the front end’s damaged we could have a real problem.” “Thanks anyway,” he said to the stranger, “but I think we’ll find a phone and call our insurance company before we do anything.” “My friend has a phone at his garage. Look. My name’s Larry and I’d really like to help you folks out. Why don’t you follow me to his place and talk to him? He knows his business. You’re takin’ a big chance driving that car — you don’t know what happened under the hood. You can call while he looks at the damage, then decide.” The thick, smooth voice drifted over to me. My husband hesitated, glanced in my direction. “Well, I — I guess it should be checked.” He looked at me again. “Okay, we’ll go to your friend’s garage.” Larry’s eyes met mine and he smiled — a smile that almost looked evil. “Turn right at the stop sign in town,” he said. “It’s only a little ways out — you just follow me.” Bill settled in behind the wheel and started the engine before speaking. “He has a point, Sue. I don’t want anything worse to happen. I’ll have the guy check it out, then we’ll decide. Okay?” I nodded. My husband was trusting — it was his nature. He walked through life believing that most people were good and his trust usually paid off. I was the suspicious one and right now, my senses were flashing caution, caution, caution! We followed Larry down what looked like little more than a dirt path. “Where’s he going? I can hardly see a road.” “The trees are pretty thick,” said Bill. By the time we turned, our guide had all but vanished. Suddenly we came out into a clearing strewn with old, rusting farm machinery and cars, in various stages of dismemberment. “Talk about no mans’ land,” my husband observed. “You could drop off the face of the earth up here.” “Lovely thought,” I said. We watched Larry walk toward a dimly lit garage where someone appeared to be working on a vehicle. After a brief conversation, both men approached us. They were similar in appearance from their expressions down to their shoes. “This here’s my friend Joe. He’s real good at fixin’ cars,” said Larry. “You folks never did tell me your name.” “I’m Bill Andrews and this is my wife, Sue. Do you have a phone I could use? I’d like to notify our insurance company.” “Inside the door on the left,” said Joe. “Meantime, I’ll take a quick look at your car, if you’ll pop the hood.” “Sure,” Bill answered. He reached down, pulled the lever and I stepped out of the car. While he was crossing the distance to the garage, both Joe and Larry put their heads under the hood, out of my vision. Bill disappeared through the door and the next thing I knew there was an explosion. It seemed as if the entire car was filling with smoke. The speed of the inflating air bag made me duck. I must have let out a yell, because Bill came running out of the building. “Sue! What’s wrong? Oh my God! What made that happen?” “The sensor tripped,” Joe said. “I barely touched it and the thing went off. Good thing you weren’t drivin’ any distance. Could have had a real serious accident — might even been killed. Did ya get your insurance company?” “No, I didn’t. It seems that your phone doesn’t work.” “You sure? It was okay a few minutes ago. Let me go check.” They walked back and I could hear my husband’s agitated voice. His face was red as he came through the door. “We’re leaving!” he stated, striding toward me. “Can you drive the car like that?” The air bag was already deflated but the smoky substance was still there. “I don’t think so,” Joe said. “Hey, I can’t help it if the phone’s out of order. Happens all the time out here. Probably go back on soon. Air bag should be replaced though.” Bill turned the key and the starter clicked, but nothing else. Two more tries produced the same result. He slammed the palm of his hand down hard on the steering wheel. “Well, appears she’s gonna need some work before you can leave.” Joe looked around at the deepening shadows. “I got an extra room you can use.” He pointed toward a ramshackle house partially hidden from view. “No sense doin’ anything tonight — can’t see anyway. But I’ll start first light tomorrow. Phone’ll probably be workin’ by then. Don’t worry. We’ll fix ‘er right up. Oh, I’m gonna need your keys. So’s I can start early.” When Bill hesitated, Joe added “Y’know, so’s I can lock ‘er up tonight.” “Okay, fine,” said Bill. “Just get it so we can drive. We’ll take care of the air bag when we get home.” “I don’t like this at all,” I said, looking at the sparsely furnished room. “Is there a lock on that door?” “No. Sue, we don’t have another choice, at least not tonight. Try to get some rest.” He stretched out on the bed and I sank down next to him, fully intending to stay awake all night. We were in a situation where we had no control, and no one in the world knew where we were. My eyes opened as daylight filtered through the dirty window of this strange and silent place. I jumped up, disoriented, calling my husband’s name. “It’s okay — I’m right here. Did you have a bad dream?” “No, I — I’m all right, but I could really use a bathroom.” “I’ll find one — wait here. Don’t wander around without me.” While he was gone, I tried to see something from the window but the angle through the wavy glass showed only the side of the other building and trees to the rear. When I looked at my hand, it was covered with peeling paint from the sill. Harsh morning light revealed a sagging ceiling over shabby walls and a floor coated with dirt that hadn’t happened overnight. “There’s a bathroom of sorts just down the hall,” Bill announced. “Don’t touch anything if you can help it. Come on — I’ll stand by the door.” A few minutes later we were outside in the yard. Our van was exactly as we left it. “Where is everyone?” Bill said. “Let’s check the garage.” There was no one there. “Try the phone again. Maybe it started working.” He picked it up, clicked the button a few times, replaced the receiver. “Nothing. We have to find somebody. Did you notice if Larry’s car is still out there?” I poked my head out the door and looked around. “It’s gone. Maybe he took Joe somewhere to get a part, or report the phone, I hope. Bill, what are we going to do? We’re trapped up here. Do you think we should try walking out to the road and hailing a ride back to that town?” “No — not right now, anyway. I’m not going to leave our car here. Someone has to show up, eventually — maybe Joe’s still sleeping.” So we waited. My restlessness drove me from Bill’s side and I wandered through the discarded automobile parts scattered around the yard. So many different pieces — some I could recognize, some not, some looking as if they had only been there a short while. I turned back towards Bill, stumbled and fell against a barrel. My weight caused it to tip, then overturn. Bill came running over. “Are you all right? Please be careful Sue — you could fall on something sharp … what’s that?” He was looking at a metallic object partially buried in the dirt. I rubbed it with my foot. The outline of a license plate became visible. Closer inspection revealed the word ‘California’ written in red over the number. “Oh my God, Bill! Look at that!” We both stared. The sticker in the corner read ‘CA 95'. The month was February. This was July. When I looked at him, his eyes were echoing the thought in my head — what was this doing here, buried in the dirt of this man’s yard, so far away from California? “Listen! Is that an engine?” The sound sent us scurrying into action — we quickly stood the barrel upright and distanced ourselves from it. The car pulled up and Joe stepped out, arms laden with sacks that shouted ‘McDonald’s’ all over them. “You folks hungry?” He was holding a steaming coffee cup toward me. When I reached for it, my hands trembled. “Well,” Joe said, “the phones are out all over town. Auto shop didn’t open ‘till nine. I can get the parts I need then fix whatever else is wrong. Problem is — gotta pay cash. Afraid my credit ain’t too good lately. Had a few setbacks. So I’m probably gonna need a couple hundred — he don’t take checks.” He looked expectantly at Bill. “Can’t you pay for them and then we’ll pay you when you’re finished?” “Well, see — problem is, I’m also kinda broke. You wanna go pick up the parts, it’s okay by me. Larry’ll take you over. But he won’t take your check, neither.” “My wife can go in with Larry and put them on our credit card. We don’t carry a lot of cash when we travel.” The two men exchanged a look that made me shiver. “Sure,” said Larry. “I can bring her into town. Take us a couple hours, probably.” Bill put his arm around my shoulder and walked with me to Larry’s car. “Please be careful,” he said in a low voice. “And when you get to wherever you’re going, try to call the insurance company. Here — take the number. Even if they can’t do anything now, at least we’ll have notified them. And make sure you tell them where we are.” “I will. And don’t worry — I’ll be fine.” By that time Larry was behind the wheel with the engine running. I opened the door, gave Bill a weak smile and climbed inside. We drove in silence until we reached the main road and Larry turned — in the opposite direction of town. “Aren’t we going the wrong way?” I asked, motioning behind me. “We’re not goin’ to Worcester. Place Joe found the parts he needs — it’s just down the road a piece. This here’s a short cut over the mountain. Road’s not real good, but it’s quicker.” He wasn’t exaggerating. We seemed to climb forever and the farther we went, the worse the road became — in places, little more than dirt where a few patches of pavement still clung. As we neared the bottom on the other side, a town came into sight. “Shop’s up ahead to the right,” said Larry. He pulled in under a sign that read simply ‘Auto Parts Store’. “It looks deserted,” I said. “He knows we’re coming,” Larry answered. He tried the front door and when it didn’t open, he motioned toward the rear of the store. I spoke through the car window. “Do you want me to come with you?” “No — I’ll come get you if he’s in there. Might have gone to lunch or somethin’.” He disappeared and I leaned back against the seat and closed my eyes, feeling very vulnerable. I needed to keep my wits and all I wanted to do was cry. Larry finally returned and beckoned to me. “He’s here — doin’ some work in the back. C’mon — we can get the parts and be on our way.” I walked beside him, clutching my purse close to my body as if it were going to be snatched away at any moment. A miniature of Joe’s yard appeared behind the building and a grimy man in coveralls came toward us. “Got your parts in here,” he was heading toward a door. “C’mon in. We can take care of everything inside.” He was making out a bill as I entered. “Don’t take checks. Did they tell you?” “Yes. I’m going to pay with a credit card.” “Oh. Okay, wait a minute. I got a machine around here someplace. Gotta find it. Most people just pay cash.” “Do you suppose I could use your phone to call my insurance company? It’s a toll-free number.” “I wouldn’t mind,” he said, “but the phone was out last I checked. Happens all the time around here. All these lines need working on — they’re old. I’ll go see if it’s fixed yet.” When he returned, he was carrying a manual credit card machine and a receipt. “Phone’s still not working — sorry.” He took my card, ran it through his machine and I signed my name. Larry picked up the box with our parts and we headed back over the mountain. “Did you get the carbons from the credit card?” my husband asked. “There were none — but that doesn’t mean he won’t … ” “How about his phone? Was it also conveniently out of order?” “Yes. We can’t call, we can’t leave … ” My voice seemed to stick in my throat. I took a deep breath. “Bill, we’ve got to stop this. I’m really getting scared. Let’s keep out of his way until our car is fixed and we can get out of here. We’ve got to believe everything will be all right!” We wandered along the side of the house toward the rear and into a yard that was fairly uncluttered. The house seemed to be surrounded by trees except for the front. I was trying to see if there was another way out when Bill’s voice stopped me. “Be careful, Sue. I don’t want to lose sight of you. Let’s find a place to sit and wait.” We were nearing the front when we heard voices coming from the garage. “… her all the phones were out. I don’t … ” “Sshht!” A little sound escaped my throat. I felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. What was going on around here? I opened my mouth to speak and Bill put his finger to my lips, then walked noisily into the garage. “How’s the car coming? Did he have all the parts?” “Sure did. It’s comin’ along just fine. Larry here’s giving me a hand — should be through in a couple hours. You folks get hungry, Larry can take you into town for a sandwich or somethin’. Not much here, unless you want some soup. I don’t do much cookin’. But you’re welcome to the soup. Just help yourself to the kitchen.” “That’s fine with us,” Bill said. “As long as you don’t mind, that’s what we’ll do.” He was holding my hand tightly, pulling me away from the two men. When we were out of earshot, he turned to me. “Sue, I don’t know what’s going on, but we can’t say or do anything that will make them mad. All I want is to have the car fixed enough to get us the hell out of here. Our only option now is to walk, and then we may get lost, or they might … ” His voice trailed to a stop. A picture of the California plate flashed in my head. I felt ill. The sun was sinking behind the trees when we finally heard their approach. “Well, she’s finished. I’ll let you start ‘er up,” said Joe. We all returned to the garage and sure enough, the van looked complete once more. Bill turned the key and it started immediately. Larry walked around to the other side and leaned down. “If you want to take ‘er for a ride I’ll go along with you. Might be a good idea.” I started around the car and Joe stopped me. “Tell you what. Why don’t we let them go and we’ll just settle the bill. That way, when they come back, you folks can be on your way.” His fingers moved suggestively against my arm, making my flesh crawl. Bill looked at me and turned off the engine. “That’s okay,” he said, “I’m sure the car is fine so let’s finish this and we’ll get out of your hair.” Joe shrugged. “Okay by me. I already got everything figured.” “There should only be labor,” said Bill. “Sue paid for the parts.” “There’s a little more than that. I had to use a few things from my place, and you know it took all day. I broke it all down right here — see?” He handed Bill a piece of paper, and my husband’s eyes opened very wide. “Fifteen hundred bucks!” he choked. “For what? All you did was fix the light and pull out the fender! How can you justify…” Joe held up his hand. “Well, I did a little more than that. It is what it is — and I don’t take checks, either.” Our keys were in his hand. They stood between us and our van. They were not smiling. “Bill please — pay them. I want to get out of here.” His hesitation was brief — he pulled out a credit card. Joe shook his head. “Sorry folks. I ain’t set up for credit cards. Gotta be cash.” “You know we don’t carry that much cash,” I said. “Well, now what’re we gonna do about that?” said Joe. “Guess if you really don’t have it, you’ll have to go into town and draw some out of that bank.” “There are no banks open at this time of day,” Bill answered. “Look — we’re honest people. We’ll go into town, rent a motel for the night and bring you the money in the morning. You don’t have to worry about us — I’ve never cheated anyone in my life.” Joe’s laugh was ominous. “I don’t think so. Looks like you’re gonna spend one more night with us. Bank’ll be open at nine in the mornin’ — we’ll settle up then. Oh — Larry here will be stayin’ the night, too. Just in case you get any ideas about leavin’ before then. And I’ll just keep your keys for you.” That night I didn’t close my eyes. I paced. The thought entered my mind that this was the first time I’d ever been in jail. A laugh from somewhere in the house seemed to echo in the hallway before fading away. The room was warm. I was cold. “He won’t let us both go into town tomorrow,” I said. “You know that. He’s done this before — both of them. It’s extortion.” “You’re right, Sue. Not that we can do anything about it until we leave. And even then — he’ll give us a bill, which we’ll pay — what would you do about it? They know what they can get away with.” He was silent for a moment. “I actually did think about trying to leave in the middle of the night. I might be able to start the car without the keys, but I’m not sure. And I can’t make things worse than they already are. What time is it now?” “Three o’clock. A half hour later than last time you asked. And fifteen minutes later than last time I looked.” “Why don’t you at least try to get some rest?” he said. “In the morning, you go to the bank and I’ll stay here, just like we did yesterday. We’ll pay him and get out of here — then if there’s anything we can do about it, we will. My concern right now is to put as much distance between them and us as possible.” He shook his head. “Unbelievable — one baby deer created all of this.” The tree tops seemed to dance as the morning sun touched them. I stood beside Bill and watched — the beauty of it out of place here, in our isolation. “Do you hear anyone?” I asked. “No, but since we're both ready, we may as well go down.” “Not yet. We can’t do anything until the bank opens and I’d rather spend the time waiting up here — I won’t have to look at them.” My husband sat on the bed and put his arms around me. “Everything is going to be all right. I’m not going to let anything happen — to either one of us. Please trust me.” “Yes, Bill. It will all work out—it has to.” “You ready?” Joe’s voice came from the hall. I looked at my watch — it was eight-thirty. Outside, Larry was standing next to the open door of our van. He motioned for Bill to sit behind the wheel and I started around to the other side. Again, Joe stopped me. “You just stay here with me until they get back. It’ll work better that way.” “Sue, why don’t you go into town with Larry and I’ll stay here,” Bill said. Joe shook his head. “No — that ain’t the way we’re gonna do it. You go — she stays.” He held up his hand as Bill started to get out of the car. “It ain’t open for debate,” he said, holding my wrist. “If I were you, I’d get goin’ so’s you can get back here. You wouldn’t want to leave me alone with this pretty little lady too long, would you?” My husband’s face turned red. “If anything happens to her, I promise you that you will pay, no matter what it costs me.” Joe laughed. It was an ugly sound. “Then I suggest you get goin’ so you can get back. Or it’ll cost you more than money.” The wheels spun as Bill gunned the motor. The van disappeared into the trees. I listened to the familiar sound fade into nothing. Only then did I realize that Joe was still touching me. I looked into his grinning face, shuddered and pulled away. “If you don’t mind,” I said, “I think I’ll wander around until they get back.” “Now wait a minute, little lady. Why don’t you come on in and I’ll make you some coffee?” “No thanks. I’m fine, really. I — I’ll stay out here.” I stepped away and he reached for me again — this time, he grasped my shoulder. “Well,” he said, “I want some coffee and I’m not gonna leave you out here alone. Let’s just do this the easy way — and you come on inside with me.” He pushed me toward the house and I didn’t resist. I couldn’t chance his anger while we were here alone, so I would sit, have coffee and talk to him until my husband returned. It would be the safest way, or so I thought. We walked into the kitchen and I headed for a chair on the opposite side of the table. I cringed as his finger caressed my cheek. “You know you’re right,” I said, hastening away. “Coffee would really taste good right now.” “Well you sit right there while I get it started. Only take a minute, then we’ll get to know each other. Trouble with people today, everybody’s a stranger. People ought to be friendlier, don’t you think?” He put water and coffee in an electric pot and plugged it in. Then he walked around and sat next to me, pulling his chair close. His leg touched mine. I jumped up as if electrified, scraping the chair loudly against the wooden floor. In no time I was on the other side of the table. He just sat there — laughing. “Now where do you think you’re goin’, little lady? Y’know, you’re being downright unfriendly. You really don’t want to do that, do you? Old Bill’s gonna be gone a while — Larry’s gonna take him around the long way. We got some time to kill, you and me, and I got a few plans. No sense in fightin’ — won’t do you no good. You ain’t goin’ nowhere.” He stood and came toward me. The table was large and heavy and I circled it, managing to stay out of his reach. He was laughing as he changed direction, keeping me away from the door and possible freedom. How could I distract him? I couldn't take my eyes off him long enough to look around. The coffee was gurgling, the smell filling the room, steam rising into the air. One more circle and I was standing next to it. I took a deep breath, grabbed the pot and threw it. He saw it coming and raised his arms to shield his face — too late. The lid came off, splashing the hot water. “Shit! You bitch! You scalded me! I’m gonna … ” Through the door and outside, I headed for the woods — Joe directly behind me. The thudding footsteps came closer and closer — I felt rather than saw the arm reach out. I veered away. His fingers caught a piece of my shirt. I yanked free. Then I was running in circles, barely avoiding his lunges. I skirted a broken-down truck and almost collided with a brick structure. He was on the other side and reversed his direction — I did the same. When he couldn’t get to me, he stopped. My hands gripped the rough edge as I waited for his next move, panting. We eyed each other — predator and prey, the sound of our ragged breathing pounding in my ears. He swayed and I tensed, ready to go in the opposite direction. How long could I do this — would I last until Bill returned? Joe made his move. He climbed on top of the bricks. I turned and ran. The next thing I heard was a sharp ‘crack’ — whatever he stepped on broke. Good, I thought. Maybe that will slow him down. “Help!” His voice, muffled. I glanced over my shoulder and he was gone. All I saw were fingers gripping the brick ledge. Scraping sounds came from inside. “Help me — please!” I walked over and cautiously peered into the structure. He was trying to scale one side with his feet while holding on to the other side. It looked like an old well — unused long enough so the sides were dry. The wooden cover had broken, most of it, gone. I few pieces of wood remained, jutting sharply from the sides of the well. “I can’t hold on — please — help me up.” “That’s funny,” I said. “Help you up so you can do whatever you want to me. I was born in the city, not the sticks.” “No — I wasn’t gonna hurt you … ” More scrambling and he managed to brace his back against the far side. He actually started walking up the wall, his hands flat against the bricks behind him. My help was no longer needed — and his tone changed. “Okay,” he grunted, “city or sticks — ain’t gonna make no difference. I was just gonna fun with you — now you ain’t gonna think it’s funny. You can’t get away … ” He looked up as he spoke those last words — and that's when he disappeared. The brick he was holding broke. His howl echoed for a few seconds, there was a thud, then stillness. I stood motionless, stunned, my hands covering my mouth. No sound came from the well. I looked over the edge. There was nothing to see, only a black hole. “Joe? Can you hear me? Joe?” Silence. I backed away and looked around. It was so quiet. Even the birds weren’t singing. Almost like they knew. What will he do when he sees Joe is gone? If Larry decided to extract revenge for his friend, my husband would be no match for him. I needed a weapon — a gun would be perfect. Where would he keep it? He must have one — people like him always kept guns. Back inside I yanked open kitchen drawers, my ears straining for the sound of the returning car. The last drawer I opened was full of rags. Nothing! In frustration, I slammed it shut so hard it bounced back, spilling out its contents. Something hard hit the floor. I dug through the rags and there it was — a handgun. Perfect! It would fit into my pocket where it would stay unless I needed it. What if it isn’t loaded? I ejected the clip and to my relief, it was full. Outside, I waited. Joe’s face stayed with me as I paced back and forth, back and forth on the small porch. I couldn’t take my eyes off the well — the slightest sound made me jump. My imagination saw him coming for me, slowly climbing up the sides. What was taking them so long? Relief mixed with dread when at long last I heard the engine and the van drove into the yard. They walked toward me. “Where’s Joe?” asked Larry. “Uh, he’s inside. He — he’ll be right out. Did everything go okay?” My husband didn’t respond. I was looking at him, trying to send a message with my mind. After all our years together we sometimes knew each other’s thoughts. Larry walked around until he was directly behind Bill. As much as I concentrated on my husband, I couldn’t stop myself from looking at Larry. The smile started slowly, until it spread across his entire face. “Well I’ll be damned! You got him, didn’t you?” “I don’t know what you’re talking about. He’s inside, I told you. He — if you don’t believe me, why don’t you go look?” “That’s what you want, ain’t it — so you two can take off. Well, if he’s inside, I got a feelin’ he ain’t in too good a shape. So I might’s well settle his account for him. Bill old boy, I’ll take whatever you got in your pocket. You can be on your way and I’ll settle up with Joe for you.” “I’m not giving … ” Bill stumbled forward as Larry twisted his arm behind his back. “Hey — what’re you doing? Let go of me!” Joe’s nasty laugh came out of Larry’s mouth. “Stand still now — I could break your arm real easy. Now, little lady, why don’t you just pull the money out of old Bill’s pocket — okay? No games, now — unless you think you can get me, too. Bill here won’t be much help with a broken arm. And if you hurry, I’ll let you go on down the road a piece before I discover what you did to Joe. I told him he’d get outsmarted someday.” My husband’s face was ashen and I knew there was no choice. I went to him and put my hand in his right pocket. “It’s not in this pocket. Must be in the other one.” “Hurry it up!” snapped Larry. I reached in and pulled out a wad of bills. Larry’s greedy eyes lit up and he grabbed the money. He turned away and began to count it. I stepped close to my husband, slipped my hand in my pocket and pulled out the gun. “Give that back!” Larry looked at me, then at the gun in my hand and began to laugh. “Where’d you get the toy gun?” he said. “Probably don’t even work. Kinda shaky, ain’t ya? You better give that to me.” He walked toward me. The gun went off. He stopped, a look of surprise on his face. His hand went to his side. A red stain was spreading through his shirt, above his belt. His face darkened, surprise quickly changing to anger. Bill took the gun and held it on him. “Okay, we’re leaving. Get over by the house and stay there until we drive out. Wait — hand me my money.” It was still clutched in Larry’s hand. He looked down at it, then back at Bill. “Like hell!” He yanked the knife from his belt and lunged. Bill pulled the trigger. This time Larry staggered backwards, blood oozing from a wound in his shoulder. He was on the ground, face contorted. The voice that came at us was low, menacing. “You think you’re gonna drive away and it’s over. Think again. I know where you live.” Dead air hung among the three of us — the words, a physical thing. My husband finally spoke, still holding Larry’s stare. “Sue, we can’t leave him like this.” “Let’s just get out of here. He won’t … ” He looked at me with the oddest expression and this time, his meaning was clear. “Oh my God! No — you can’t … ” “Do you want to look over your shoulder the rest of your life? Or — maybe he’ll go to the police and then we’ll be in jail — one dead, the other wounded.” He stopped, his eyes searching my face. “Bill! Please! Let’s get … ” “Where’s Joe? Is he dead, Sue?” There was a lump in my throat that seemed to grow as I stood there. My words whispered out. “He’s — the well — b-but — he fell — I didn’t … ” “Doesn’t matter,” he said. “All that will matter is what Larry decides to do. If he goes to the police, it’ll be his word against ours — and he has two bullet holes in him. If he doesn’t go to the police … ” “The bank!” I said. “They saw him with you. Just tell them … ” “He didn’t come in with me, he didn’t have to. You were back here, he knew I wouldn’t do anything to put you in further jeopardy.” “But — they’ll be found!” “No one will look for a long time. I’ll take my chances.” “Bill, I can’t … ” “There is no other choice. Go sit in the car.” “What are you g-going … ” “Sue, get in the car! Go on!” As I waited, I kept seeing Larry’s eyes — full of rage — eyes that would stay with me. There was another shot. A few minutes went by before Bill sat next to me in the car. We drove away. Silence hung heavy between us. His breathing was rapid, his knuckles white, gripping the wheel. The lines in his face seemed a little deeper — like the lines in a face staring out of a recent photograph — his father’s photograph. Our freedom was a trap. There was no escape. What would our future hold? A shadow blotted the lone shaft of sunlight that reached into the dark hole. He hunched back into a hollow the water had made before the well ran dry. Larry’s body fell at his feet, landing on top of their last hapless victim. He waited. Time passed. When he felt it was safe, he put his back to the bricks, feet flat against the opposite side and slowly started ‘walking’ up the wall. Today he would rest, plan — tomorrow, he would head south. Florida should be nice this time of year. ",candidate00008
17,00005,unknown,"I WRITE this sitting at a desk, wind serene about me, clouds forming and unravelling in beautiful shapes above me. I write this, and you are forgiven if you don’t see the shakes in my hands, or notice the hurried scrawl of my writing. I write fast as I have no idea when he might come back to me. According to my watch, it has been three days and roughly six hours since I last held him, and fourteen hours since I last saw him and heard his voice. I’ll be back, Dad, he had said. And I believe him. So I wait for him still. There are noises in the far distance. Weird, animal hoots and growls, and I am certain they are of a kind I have not heard before. The wind smells faintly of cut grass and faintly of rot. I do not know which I prefer, because cut grass reminds me too vividly of home, and sunny, perfect days on the lawn with my son, throwing Frisbees and kicking balls. I can close my eyes and imagine the silk of his translucent yellow hair. I don’t close my eyes too often here, because when I do, the sounds and smells become all the more real, as if I am compensating for the loss of one sense by heightening my others. And so I make the very things I am trying to avoid all the closer. When I try to look for the source of the sounds, it is as if my eyes suddenly cease to focus, and the far distance becomes blurred and pale, as if seen through mist. Only when I return my gaze to the desk do things become sharp again. My son has been gone for over three days, have I said that? I heard him speak those final words after two and a half days searching, and as I called out to him, spinning to look in every possible direction, I was sure I caught a glimpse of his bright red tee shirt. Then it was gone and I am now not so sure I saw anything. I’ll be back, he said. And so I write, waiting for some sign. Waiting for the courage to follow those sounds into the far distance and find my boy. He first showed me the ladder on the day after his eighth birthday. We have a large oak tree at the bottom of our garden, standing monolith-like on the edge of a large but unkempt lawn, all other plants and garden ornaments placed in such a way that they seem to draw the eye to it, although this is wholly unintended. This particular day, my son was standing in front of the tree, looking smaller than ever, and I can still see the way the dappled sunlight played on his face, soft ripples of light turning his hair white and then darkening to a caramel blonde. I loved him more than ever at that moment, I think. If only I had done things differently. You may read that line more than once in this… … confession? Yes, confession fits. Around the tree was an old garden seat, its deep green paint long ago weather-faded so that it almost seemed part of the tree. It curved around the tree about a third of the way round, and as I watched, my son stepped up on it, reaching to touch the ladder that folded itself around the front of the tree, then continued a curve around its massive girth, ever upwards. It vanished from sight into the branches around the back. I had never seen the ladder before. I stared. My son turned to face me, a look of wild excitement on his face, and even across the distance I could see the sheen in his eyes and the wind in his hair. I think that the look he had is saved specifically for eight year old boys, when every event becomes adventure, every darkness becomes a monster-filled cave, and every anomalous ladder simply another thing to climb just because it is there. The look said, Can I climb it, Dad? Can I? I started towards him, a look of concern obviously showing, for he dropped his hand and stood on the seat, barely able to contain his jittering. I approached the tree, ruffling my son’s hair as I passed and I looked closely at the ladder. As I think back on it, it is a surprise even to me that I felt no shock at seeing it there. It was as if I convinced myself it had always been there and I had just never seen it. It seemed to begin somewhere at the back of the tree, out of sight, its rungs organic and woody, laced with delicate ivy, slick with old moss. I stepped slowly to the side and followed it around the tree. It seemed to curve forever upward and as I stood at the back, it yet again disappeared out of sight, this time around the front of the tree. And there was no sign of its beginnings. I stared. I told myself I had just been at the front of the tree and the ladder did not reappear there as it surely must, looking at it from this angle. I hurried around the tree, following the ladder as I went, and I found myself again at the front, seeing the original perspective. Then again around to the back of the tree where it vanished into the branches. It seemed that wherever I began following the ladder, its origins were out of sight, and it disappeared into the branches at either side. It was the most perplexing optical illusion, and I followed it two more times, coming up with the same conclusion each time. What is it, Dad? my son asked. I grinned at him (and that grin I now feel was the start of it all, as if I had given his excitement the fuel and permission it needed to grow. God, had I but known.), and shrugged, feeling like an excited child myself. I had an idea, and I asked my son to run in the house. He did, dutifully, and I spent the time he was gone walking round and round the tree, following the ladder with my hand, losing it as it became too high, but marking the height of its disappearance and time after time I marvelled at the way the ladder just seemed to begin again at that height (which was always about four feet off the ground) without being visible on the opposite side. My son returned. In his hand he clutched a red crayon, and I took it from him and began to retrace my steps, this time running the crayon along the edge of the ladder. When the ladder became too high to comfortably reach, I marked the height by running the crayon along the trunk itself, picking up the ladder again at the front, impossibly at the same height as it always had been. By the time I had walked around the trunk a further four times, there were five clear lines of red following the ladder’s progress. I must be stooping as I reach the front, I thought as I made a sixth journey. But, no. I wasn’t. I dropped the crayon. It hit me that the sensation was like running my hand around the sharp edge of a giant screw that was boring its way into the earth, so that, give or take depending on my speed around the tree, the height of my hand on the leading edge of ladder remained the same. But, unless I was having a massive leap away from all my senses, the tree did not seem to be boring its way into the earth. I was stumped. You may think that the next logical step was to mount the thing and follow it upwards. Of course. But we didn’t. Not then anyway. I ushered my son away from the tree, distracting him with promises of ice cream and movies and for a day or two, we almost forgot about the ladder. And then he climbed it. He was up it and gone before I knew what was happening. He had a glazed look on his face as if something had called him, hypnotising, and as I ran towards the tree, calling his name so loud that my throat was still hurting three days later, I saw him turn to look at me only once. The look I saw there chilled me then and does still, as I relive it for this account. He looked at once as if he knew exactly what he was doing, and at the same time as if he was being pulled away from all he knew and loved, and his face screamed to me to stop him. The pleading I saw in his eyes, desperate helpless pleading as if it was a stranger on the ladder pulling him upwards rather than the power of his own legs, forced my own legs into a paroxysm of power and I cleared the distance to the tree in seconds. I was too late however, for as I reached the trunk and followed the spiral steps around it, I caught a glimpse of his shoe as it disappeared into the leaves. And then nothing. I ran, I circled the tree hopelessly in the vain hope that I would see him up in the branches, a cruel trick. Of course, I saw no such thing. The ladder wound terminally onwards, ever spiralling, each revolution of the tree seeming to launch it into its ascent anew. Of my son, there was no sign. It was as if he had vanished. I screamed his name up into the branches, scanning their depths for a sign of him, but I saw nothing. The leaves continued their soft waving, and the breeze sighed through them and for a moment I imagined his voice calling me. I thought my heart would break at that moment. I gathered myself for the ascent, and had even stepped onto the bench at the tree’s base, when I heard his soft step. I saw one foot, then the other and I stood paralysed, waiting. Of course, it was him. His hair looked ruffled and was flecked through here and there with seeds and grass. There was a flush to his cheeks, the exuberant glow of a child at energetic play. I reached up to him, snatched him off the ladder and threw us both to the ground, sobbing and clutching him tightly. He was silent, and he shook, I presumed with fear, but as I separated us, and held him at arms length for the admonition that had to come, I saw he was shaking with laughter. Indeed, he seemed paralysed by it, tears coursing down his grubby face, his white teeth shining through the redness of his moistened lips. His silenced ended suddenly in a gasping inrush of air, and I heard the familiar cackle of his laughter. Despite myself, despite my fear and coldness that still caressed my bones, I smiled. The smile grew and I began to laugh with him, caught up by the infection rather than for any genuine humour. I felt his admonishment dissolving in that sound and I hugged him close. Finally we stood and I looked close at him, the laughter subsiding, his eyes trained first on me, but ever glancing towards the ladder, quick and furtive. What happened? Where did you go? I asked him, feeling foolish but unable to rephrase the question so that it made sense to me. Dad, why didn’t you come with me? was his reply. It was fun. Loads of fun! I must have frowned at this, for he focused solely on me for a moment. What happened up there? I asked again. I just played! But it was so much fun, Dad! he replied. The chill of fear began to return, and God help me, for an instance I looked at my son and I swear I had to stop myself looking for the birthmark at the crown of his skull for proof that it really was he who had returned. But you were only gone for seconds! I said feebly. Don’t be silly, Dad. he said as he walked back to the house, absent-mindedly brushing grass seeds from his hair. It was hours. Two at least! Why didn’t you come, we could’ve played together?! He left me standing at the base of the oak tree, speechless. In a fit of foolishness, of reckless curiosity, I asked him that night of what he had seen, of where the ladder had ended. I wanted to know. The ladder doesn’t end, Dad. I got off in a field and played there for hours. The sun was shining and there was grass and trees and footballs and everything! I asked him what he meant when he said the ladder doesn’t end. I mean it keeps going. It just carried on until I couldn’t see it anymore. Round and round and round the tree. It must be a long walk to wherever it really ends. Do you want to come with me, Dad? he asked. I said no, and that I never wanted him to go back there. I said that we have trees and grass and footballs and everything he would ever need or want right here. I said that the ladder was dangerous and that until we knew what it was and where it came from, I didn’t want him anywhere near it. He reluctantly agreed, and yet his next words confirmed to me that it would be hopeless trying to keep him away. OK, Dad. I’ll see if he can come to play down here. I stared at him. Who’s ‘he’? My friend, he said. My God, I remember thinking. Just how long was he there? For me it was a matter of agonising seconds, but he is talking like he had hours to play and to even make friends. Just who the hell was up there? Is up there still? That night, after my son had gone to bed, I took a glass of wine outside and sat looking at the ladder in the failing light. I walked cautiously down the garden, and felt immediately foolish doing it, and sat with my back to the tree. I shut my eyes and tried to relive the afternoon’s events. I found that the panic and fear I had felt was slipping away (although I wasn’t sure that it wasn’t the wine helping me in that regard). Had my son really been gone for hours, instead of the seconds I had experienced? I even contemplated the notion that I had had some kind of seizure or mental block. I drank and as the sun set and the darkness really set in, I heard the noise. It was like the soft hooting of an owl, which would have been no surprise, but it sounded like it was from another place. By that I mean another… … I can’t describe any of it without sounding like a mad man. It sounded so ethereal and distant that it could have been coming from another dimension. It didn’t sound like it occupied the same space as the other natural sounds around me, the cars and the wind and the rustle of leaves above my head. I can’t explain it any further. I unconsciously shifted my position so that I half faced the tree and I looked upwards into its darkness. I could see almost nothing of the ladder itself, save for the few feet directly above my head, but it seemed to be emitting light, the faintest fluorescence, its passage through the trees marked with a blue aura. Whereas the solid ladder seemed to vanish into the tree, this aura seemed endless, and looking up at it was like looking into a spiralling image reflected from mirror to mirror, over and over. It had no end that I could see. I coughed, more to break the unearthly silence that had descended, and at that sound the haze vanished and I was left looking up into the tree like some deranged night-time bird spotter. I shook my head to clear it and went back inside, but not before the faint hooting started again. This time it was accompanied by hissing and growling that came from nothing I could imagine, nor would want to. Despite myself, by the time I reached the back door, I was moving at a healthy jog. At breakfast the next morning my son has a wild-eyed look about him, as if the dreams of the night were with him still. I asked him about them, and he said nothing. I saw him glancing past me, through the open kitchen window. Down the length of the garden. I said nothing of my experiences of the previous evening, not the eldritch light, the noises, the feeling of impenetrable depth up into the branches. As I cleared away the breakfast things, I watched my son play in the garden, thinking that to deny him access to the garden and the ladder would only increase his desire to get there. There was an almost deliberate skirting around the tree and the area surrounding it, but I did not fail to notice the looks he shot towards it. I wasn’t so far away that I could not hear him catch his breath each time he came within four feet of the tree. My heart caught at each of his stopped breaths and I imagined myself running from the kitchen, just too late to grasp his heel as he disappeared into the tree. He showed no inclination, however, of climbing again. I began to relax and brewed some tea. I carried the drink into the garden, along with my usual weekend newspaper, and selected the bench at the top of the garden to begin my week-long perusal of it. I had been reading for perhaps ten minutes when I sensed rather than heard a change in the dynamic of his playing. My heart stopped and I stood suddenly, lukewarm tea spilling into the grass. A large drop fell onto the paper, where it ran the ink like blood from a bullet hole. I stared at my son. He stood at the base of the tree, one hand resting casually on the leading edge of the ladder. His hair blew in a wind, but the wind seemed to blow downwards, as if it was coming from directly above him. He nodded slowly, and a wide grin split his face. He spoke, but the words were lost to me. They should not have been. I should have been able to hear him clearly, but I couldn’t. I started towards him, shouted his name, Walk towards me! It seemed he heard me at the last moment, turned to me, and as I saw the look on his face, I broke into a run. It was the look I had seen the last time he had climbed. Pure fear. He seemed to be imploring me to catch him, stealing glances up the ladder so that I was sure he was seeing something up there. He spoke a word, and for the life of me, I was sure it was not English. I have not heard its like before or since that moment. Its guttural bubbling sound was utterly alien coming from my son’s mouth. I saw his eyes roll upwards until they were white, and as he started to slump forward, I threw myself at him in a vain attempt to catch his fall. I was beaten to it, however. A long arm snaked downwards, fastened on a shoulder, and pulled sharply on my son’s body. The hand at the end seemed too long, and thinking back now I know I that I had convinced myself that I saw pink flesh and dark dusting hair on the back of it, and not that dark indigo scaling horror. I know now that it was no human hand that snatched my son. I collapsed onto the grass and stared weakly up into the depths. I saw nothing. No sign of my son or the thing that had taken him. The worst thing of all, perhaps, is that apart from that crawling malevolent word he uttered before he fainted, my son made no noise. There was no cry as he was taken, no sign that he even knew what had happened. Good god, I wasn’t even sure if he was alive. I sobbed into my cupped hands and raced back to the house, my first instinct to phone for help. I stopped myself with my hand in the receiver of the telephone. What on earth would I tell the police? That my son had been snatched up into the canopy by some monster that used a never ending ladder as its route through the tree? They would take me away as soon as look at me. I walked in a daze back to the tree, fearful now that I would see my son’s slumped body at its base, drained of life, and the creature (if that is what it was) crouching above him. The area around the tree was free from such visions and that was somehow worse. I reached the ladder and craned up into the darkness. Nothing. I started back to the house, desperate to do something, knowing there was only one thing that I could do. I fought with myself for minutes, precious minutes that I knew could mean the difference between finding my son and not. I curse those wasted minutes now. Fast, so as I could not stop myself, I rushed back to the start of the ladder, and leapt the first three rungs, running up it using feet and hands. At first I did not take in my surroundings, but it soon became clear that I should have easily cleared the height of the tree, and hadn’t. I slowed my ascent, and looked to either side. I saw a vista so strange and alien to me that I nearly lost balance on the rungs of the ladder. Unthinking, I stepped from it and the ground beneath my feet seemed to thrum as I made contact with it. The earth here was a deep shade of ochre, nothing strange in that, but the grass shooting through it was the colour of spun glass, transparent and yet catching the dull light and throwing out spirals of twisted rainbows in every direction. I reached my hand to it, and snatched it back quickly as the edges parted my skin like razor blades. No playground this, then. As much as I wanted to stay and explore, despite the obvious challenge, I knew (and prayed) that my son was not here and so moved on up the ladder. There seemed no end, each rung a door to as new and equally alien a landscape as that first. A breeze ruffled my hair. I smelled something in that breeze, familiar. It smelled faintly of ice cream and heat and joy, and I recognised the scent of my boy. Like a dog after a trail, I moved my head this way and that, until I thought I had detected a lightly stronger scent off to my right. I shut my eyes to focus on it, and stepped off the ladder. It felt like stepping back onto the land around my house. Smelled the same too. There were noises here, as those I had heard from the base of the tree, hooting and exuberant whistles. I opened my eyes, and saw the table off to one side, the one I am sitting at right now, sitting in a patch of bare ground. The earth was the red colour of the Australian outback. To all sides, I saw fields upon fields of deep yellow corn, alongside tall trees that stretched into infinity. Beneath all of it, the redness of the earth looked like sunburned skin from which the corn grew like hair. I though I saw movement in the corn, shadows and flitting shapes that leaped and cavorted among the dusty stems. I stared harder but this only served to blur the edges of my vision and so I looked away. On the table I saw a pen and paper. Hooked over the back of the chair that accompanied the table, as casually as if it had been at home, was my son’s jacket. I rushed to it, expecting to find something, some warmth in its cloth that would give me a clue. It was cold, and as I drew nearer, I saw splashes of mud coating it. I grabbed it up and crushed my face into it. I shouted my son’s name again and again until my voice cracked and failed me, the sound thinning as it raced across the expanse. Clouds of dust and dried corn husk rose from the fields as if in response to my calls, but I neither received, nor expected, further reply. I sat heavily at the desk, feeling the chair creak under my weight, and spread my son’s coat out in front of me. I absently picked at the flecks of dried mud, thankful it was not blood. I looked down at the red ground, not wanting to see the way my hands shook, not wanting to see the way they looked in the pallid yellow light of this place. My mind was filled with voices, all clamouring to be heard, all saying one thing or another, all mine. I bit down hard on my lip to snap myself out of this destructive thinking. Blood slowly filled the gap between my lower lip and my teeth and as I tasted the bitterness of it, my eyes found something on the ground at my feet. A tiny depression in the hard soil, no more than a fingers length. A swirling pattern in the middle of it, concentric circles the size of a small coin. I jolted in the chair so hard that my thighs caught painfully on the underside of the desk. I stood suddenly, tipping the chair backwards, and still clutching my son’s jacket, I sank so that my face almost touched the earth. The voices in my head quietened suddenly. I knew this pattern. I had seen its like rendered numerous times in mud on the floor of my kitchen. It was my son’s shoe print, I was sure of it, and now that I had seen one, I seemed to see them all. Some were only traces of the print, some more full, and they led in a weaving pattern away from the desk and into the cornfields. What my eyes also found, and what I tried to not see, were the prints next to them, crossing them, scuffing them out. They looked vaguely bird like, long and slender with three distinct trailing scratches at the front each, as if made by three claws dragging with each footstep. I stood and looked around. Apart from the desk and the ladder shimmering blue in the air next to it, all was red earth and yellow corn. Without stopping to think, I tucked the arms of my son’s jacket into my jeans and started following the footprints. The going was hard, strangely so, as if the very ground was holding me back. My feet seemed to drag, and I had the strangest thought that if I possessed sharp claws, they would leave that weird little dragging scratch in the earth like the ones I was following. When I looked down at my feet I saw that the redness of the earth had crept up the legs of my jeans almost to the knee. I thought, no, I knew, that when I looked away the ground would be reaching up again, grasping my legs, slowing me down. I called out my son’s name suddenly, not liking the hoarseness of my voice, but calling again anyway. A flock of birds exploded from the cornfield, black as crows but twice their size at least, oily blueness shimmering from their wingtips in the low sun. They were a way off too, and I had no desire to see them up close. I watched them depart with no little relief. I allowed myself to think that the noise they made as they flew, the barking calls they made unlike any crow I had ever heard, the hissing as their wings exited the dry corn, completely masked the call made by my son as he answered me. Despite their racket, I almost heard him, I am sure of it. If I had made the sound up in my head, would I have added details like the obvious sound of his distress, and the low guttural rumbling that could only have come from his captor? I began to run then, mimicking the birds’ flight with my own, obliterating the footprints and the claw prints, tearing my legs through the grasping soil, seeing a red rain of dust flick from the ends of my shoes as each left the ground. The low rumble that I imagined was the voice of my son’s kidnapper grew louder and I almost thought I saw a flash of indigo scales as it sped away through the corn field. I screamed as loud as I could manage as I ran, the name of my son becoming indistinct, morphing into a single strained syllable of wrenching pain. I thought I heard him again then, all trace of the hypnosis he seemed to have been under gone and simply fear and anger and sadness and loss remaining. I urged my legs to move faster and sensed the ground under my feet responding to this as the creeping redness reached to my knees and then further, clawing at my thighs. Still I ran. Hours passed, or seemed to. My watch was still running, but I wasn’t sure I could trust its timing. In the blink of an eye, hours would pass, and then time would slow so that I seemed to cross vast distances in mere seconds. I heard the shuffling steps of the kidnapper at every twist and turn of the corn plants, and as they slowly merged and then vanished into forests of deep green trees, the sounds grew quieter and eventually stopped altogether. I slept when I literally had no strength to stand, but the sleep was fitful and seemed to last no more than minutes. My watch said differently however, and a day, and then two seemed to pass. I felt time’s progress in the growth of stubble on my face, but in nothing else. I did not eat and I drank what water I could find in the forests, praying I would not sicken before I had found my son. It was perhaps two days, or maybe two and a half when I eventually saw him, I was so shocked that for a moment I didn’t recognise him. He stood some distance from me, on the edge of the forest as it turned back to the red dusty ground. I was close enough to see streaks of tears cutting through the dirt on his face. Close enough to smell him. He stood with his head bowed, and as I scanned around for his tormentor, I saw nothing. I looked back to my son, heart racing, words drying in my throat, and I reached for him. He caught my eye suddenly, and the look in his eyes stopped me cold. It was blank fear, and yet he seemed to be telling me something with tiny movements of his head, shaking this way and that. He looked to his right and then left and again shook his head. I saw a grimace of pain cross his face then, and he crumpled slightly. As I looked to either side of him, and he was lost to the periphery, finally I saw what he was telling me. From the corner of my eye, I saw. The creature was not gone. It stood, its many-jointed, bowed legs dripping moisture and a glistening swollen sac of a body depending from them, its arms wrapped around my son, scaled hands at his throat. It shrouded itself somehow from me, so that when I looked back to my son, it vanished. And yet now I had seen it, I couldn’t un-see it. I gagged with the fear and revulsion, with the pain of seeing my boy harnessed by such horror. The thing tugged at him and he stumbled against the soft body. A mouth opened on its flank, more a raw wet hole than a mouth, but from it issued the same gargling sounds I had heard my son speak in the moments before his abduction. I wasn’t sure if it was talking to me or my son, but I saw him nodding gently, and I sensed his fear subsiding, or at least abating for the moment, both in his eyes and the set of his body. His hands, that had been fisted tightly this whole time, slowly unclenched, and I was close enough to see tiny white crescents on his palms where his fingernails had dug in. Go back, Dad he said, and my heart stopped at the sound of his voice. Go back to the ladder and wait for me. I began to protest, but days with mere mouthfuls of liquid had turned my voice into a silent scratch and I’m not sure he would have heard even if I had continued. As it was, he held his hands out and implored me. Dad, please! Go back. Wait at the ladder and I will find you. I’ll be back, Dad. I promise. I love you, and I’ll be back. Now GO! The creature wrenched my son onto its back suddenly and now I saw it fully. I gagged again and started running towards the spot where they had been standing, but I was too late. They vanished in a cloud of red dust, and I heard him shout as they went. I’ll be back, Dad I sank to my knees and watch them leave, the dust settling just enough for me to glimpse the bright red of his tee shirt before it was shrouded in distance and mist and dry, cracking corn plants. My raw cry of loss followed them where I could not. I am back at the table, back where I began my story. I wait for my son as any father would. It took me less than a day to find my way back, and I followed what markers I could remember and what footprints remained. The birds were back in the cornfield, their cawing and flapping sounding like the crackle of fire in the dry vegetation. I hold in my mind the sound of him and the sight of him and the smell of him, and I know he will return to me. He promised and I believe him. There are sounds in the distance, have I mentioned that? They seem to be getting closer. I have moved the desk right to the point where the ladder is visible through the trees. I had a moment of inspiration and tied his jacket, which miraculously remained with me this whole time, to the last rung of the ladder that I stepped off. I think I might search for him on further rungs and in further worlds, or even go home. Just for a while, and I know now, or think at least, that I can find my way back here. I have written my son a note explaining what I have planned, but he promised me, and I believe him. I’ll be back, he said. I need to be here when he does. The jacket, still tied to the ladder, is flapping in a soft breeze. It reminds me of home, and the sound, like a kite or a flag in summer, comforts me. Every few minutes, I leave off writing and walk a distance and start calling my son. So far I have heard nothing, but he promised. ",candidate00006
18,00008,unknown,"In the summer of 1955, I remember this because I was in Grade 4, the Paulescu family arrived in our town on foot. Mr. and Mrs. Paulescu and their sons Eric and Pavel. They had only the clothes on their backs and a battered suitcase held together with frayed rope. They lived at the edge of town, next to the factories, where other displaced people also had emergency housing. Home was a one room transportable wooden hut with a rusted stove pipe. The ground between the rows of huts never seemed to dry. The mud stuck to their shoes. They were barracks people. They had done nothing to deserve the stigma that unkind people attached to them. Pavel did not want to be a barracks boy. Not then and not today either. Mr. Paulescu worked as a glazier and window installer. He was tall, lanky with long arms and large hands. He always smelled of putty. Mrs. Paulescu was a mousy woman with frizzy graying hair. I never heard her speak. Eric had his father’s build. Pavel was short and stocky, had little square teeth, reddish brownish hair and a mean temper. Pavel enrolled in Grade 6, so he was older than I by at least two years and half a head shorter. Pavel’s shoes were polished when he stepped out of the hut but he had muddy shoes at school. Wiping his shoes in long grass made it worse. People looked down at him for his dirty shoes. He found a neat solution. He wore gum boots in the mud and put on his good shoes when he came to a made road. By then people knew where he lived. There was only one way to rid himself of the mud. Pavel was always first to arrive at school and last to leave. He was forever hanging around and made notes in a cheap exercise book. He knew a few German words but was a quick learner. The Paulescus were Bulgars, so I heard. I didn’t know what that meant. But I knew that, even if true, calling them gypsies was unkind. I knew that from my mother. According to her, gypsies were not the liars, thieves and pickpockets others made them out to be. Gypsies do not steal children and eat fat dogs. Gypsies wear leather boots and colourful shirts. They dance, play accordions and violins and cook spicy food. I punched a kid on the side of the head for calling Pavel a gypsy. Pavel punched me in the head! He didn’t need me to defend him. So I punched him in the head for punching me in the head which made us even and good friends. No one after that called Pavel a gypsy. I asked him home often after school. I lost contact with Pavel when I entered high school and because Pavel continued with his primary school education. My family and I moved to a large city in 1958 and emigrated to Australia in 1962. Pavel entered our lives again eleven years later in 1969. He had obtained, in a round-about way, my mother’s address in Melbourne. She had a few letters from him and the occasional postcard from far away places. Pavel was on his way to Australia via South America. He arrived in Sydney and gave her an address. I was holidaying by car in Queensland and called at Pavel’s address in North Sydney on the way home. He and two other Germans shared an airy flat right on the foreshore at McMahons Point. We celebrated the 1971 New Year in the garden at the water’s edge. We woke the next day covered in lipstick and mascara tattoos. These crazy Tongan neighbours of his had left their mark on us. It took quite some time to wash off lipstick in various shades. Pavel liked wild company, music, food and drink and drink. He invited me to a BBQ at Lavender Bay where I met his girlfriend Frances and her parents, the Cassars from Malta. Frances was 24. She had a gorgeous figure, raven black hair, beautiful teeth and a smile that lit up faces. She was a qualified accountant but that didn't bother Pavel who was a storeman in a tile warehouse. She was infatuated with him. Her family loved Pavel. It was plain to see what would happen. But not all was rosy in the garden. Pavel drank. Pavel drank a lot. He was paralytic when I drove him home and held his head over the toilet bowl. He drank to oblivion the following night and the night after that. He was legless and I cleaned him up and the toilet after he spewed his guts out. He remembered nothing the next day and went to work as usual. His flat mates worried about him too. They had seen it coming. Pavel was in love. Frances was deeply in love and all he had to do was ask. France’s parents were well to do folk. They had welcomed him readily into the fold. They had plans. But Pavel also had plans and that meant walking. He had to leave and he wanted to stay. He had set a departure date and now felt the pressure. The closer he came to departing, the more he drank. Stay or go? He resolved the conflict every night by drinking. He wanted to be in Munich for the 1972 Olympic Games and see his mother. He had not seen her since 1958 and wanted to be there to celebrate her 50th birthday. Pavel could have flown to Munich. Mr. Cassar offered to pay the fare. No. Pavel was going to do what he had done since age 16. Walk. He was going to walk to Munich. Not directly, obviously. He would walk the South American continent’s Pacific coast from south to north over the next eighteen months. He would walk until the money ran out. Then work, save and walk on. Pavel left Sydney by air for Singapore where a cargo ship was waiting for him. Frances followed two days later. The evening before her departure, she told me Pavel’s story. Well, as much as she knew. She had noticed a backpacker at the North Sydney Railway Station. He had a street map and what looked like an address book. People were much too busy to help. Frances gave him directions to Blues Point Road and mentioned that it was quite a walk. The backpacker smiled and replied quite casually that he was used to walking. His last walk had been from Mexico to Tierra del Fuego. He thanked her and walked. Frances was intrigued and looked at an old school atlas. She borrowed books from the library. Her father was curious about her sudden interest in South American countries and cities. Frances told him about the backpacker. He was curious too. He had never heard of anyone who had walked that far. Not at least for 900 years. He told Frances about the Knights of Malta and the Order of Crusaders. A Cassar ancestor had been on a crusade to the Holy Land, so it was written somewhere. Frances just couldn’t get the long distance traveler out of her mind. She looked for him every day at the station. She hoped to run into him somewhere. Somewhere turned out to be a church at Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. Pavel was pleased to see her. Thus started a friendship that blossomed into romance. But Pavel was reluctant to meet the parents. He was unwilling to talk about his past. Frances was patient and gradually pieced together Pavel’s story. After another fight with his father, Pavel walked out on his 16th birthday. He had learnt from his mother that the Paulescus were not his real parents. Pavel was a foundling from a village somewhere in Bulgaria. The Paulescus had taken him in. He had gypsy blood for sure. Pavel decided on wandering. He applied for a refugee passport. He worked on building sites in Germany, saved his money and walked to France, then Spain until the money ran out, worked and saved. He arrived by freighter in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1964 and walked the North American Atlantic coast for three years. He worked illegally, most often on construction sites, saved and walked until his money ran out. But he never lost contact with the woman he still called mother. He wrote to her every week. She replied care of some Post Office or other. All she had to do was to put a postage stamp on an envelope addressed to him. Pavel was in Mexico City for the 1968 Olympic Games. He walked, worked and saved and walked further south as far as he could. He then worked his passage on a coastal freighter from Punta Arenas, at the bottom of South America, to Santiago in Chile and from there to Australia. He arrived in Sydney in December 1969 aboard a cargo ship from Chile, in time to celebrate Christmas with friends. I don’t know what happened in Singapore. Did Pavel change his mind? Or did Frances return from Singapore alone and broken hearted? Knowing Pavel and his wandering ways, I think he walked. I really want Pavel and Frances to be together. I have them walk the Pacific Coast up to Alaska and then to Montreal for the 1976 Olympic Games. After that, they are in Eastern Europe, maybe Bulgaria? I can see them working: Pavel as a labourer on building sites, Frances as waitress perhaps, saving their money so that they can walk until the money runs out and make Moscow in 1980. Frances would wish him Happy 46th Birthday in Seoul. I want Frances to write to her mother every week and include an envelope addressed Poste Restante at the Vladivostok Post Office in Siberia. I would love to have a letter from them telling me about the northern lights or overwintering in sunny Morocco. Above all, I want them to be happy and Pavel to find a place he wants to call home. Maybe he doesn’t need a fixed abode? Is it the gypsy blood? Will he still be on the road when he turns 70 at the London Olympic Games? When he really ought to be playing with his grandchildren? I fervently wish Frances to be there with him. I want to believe that their story has a happy ending. He will forever be my school chum, the one with the polished shoes. I have a feeling though, that no matter what, he will always be Pavel, the walker. ",candidate00004
19,00010,unknown,"My dear Richard, I apologise for the delay in writing to you but it's only now I am beginning to come to terms with the implications of your discovery, and also the news of your collaboration with the woman known to you as Pandora. Since I am certain Washington did not inform you of my involvement in this case, I must assume it was Pandora herself who told you. Considering the rather zealous security regime under which we are both accustomed to operating, you no doubt appreciate the risk you took in contacting me with this information. However, I'm certain Pandora has seen to it that your letter is overlooked by the authorities, and likewise this equally indiscreet reply. You ask me what I think the future holds for us now? Well, it is not for us to speculate much beyond the present moment, but I do believe your concerns are well grounded. From the outset I should say that Pandora was a curious case, but alas not one for the medical journals. I still need to earn a living and must therefore preserve whatever I can of my professional reputation. Nothing of what I am about to say will be of any practical benefit to you, or indeed to any of us. Also, I half suspect you will dismiss my words as nothing more than the ramblings of a fool who has dallied once too often with what Freud called the black tide of the occult. The most I can hope for is that my words might lessen your feelings of guilt that any of this is somehow your fault. You are a victim of fate, my dear Richard, as are we all. The woman you speak of uses many names. The alias of Pandora is merely the one she presented to her inquisitors at the place known to me simply as The Bunker - where, by considerable subterfuge, she had succeeded in arranging her incarceration. During my brief time in that place, as resident psychologist, I was to discover many disturbing things about her, but the most immediately striking was her appearance, the subtleties of which our Transatlantic cousins may not have thought necessary to explain to you. I cannot say how she appears to you, but to me she is rather a tall woman, full figured, olive complexion, long black hair, prominent lips and green eyes. Already perhaps you are wondering if we are discussing the same person? Well, it may also surprise you that my predecessor, our former mentor, Professor Janus, saw her as a less voluptuous creature - painfully thin, in fact, and blonde, with eyes of piercing blue. I know what you're thinking. I was sceptical too when Janus informed me of this enigma on my first day at The Bunker. To prove his point, he produced a camera, took a picture of Pandora in my presence, then asked me to do the same. I should also say that Pandora was not aware of us at the time - our observations being carried out through the one way glass of her cell. Janus then printed out both pictures, laid them on the table before me, and there the remarkable discrepancy was confirmed. They appeared to be pictures of two completely different women. With a something of a weary look, Janus then pinned them to a notice board which held a veritable sea of women's faces, all different, yet he insisted each was a likeness of Pandora. ""I'll be straight with you, Adam,"" he told me. ""I'm leaving because they want me out. And they want me out because I've made no progress with this case at all."" I was still dazed by what I had just witnessed, and a little slow in my response. ""That seems unfair, Professor. I would defy anyone to come up with an answer to this."" ""This is nothing."" He waved his finger dismissively at the pictures. ""This,… this is just the beginning of your troubles. Yet answers are what the administration wants, and sooner rather than later, or Washington will take her and that's the last we'll ever hear of it."" He gave a shrug. ""To tell the truth, I'm glad to be going. As soon as I walk out of here I'll be spending the rest of my life convincing myself none of this ever happened."" I looked more closely at the pictures, only half listening to Janus who, as you may remember from our student days, always had something of a reputation for melodrama. ""All taken by different people,"" I said, though I spoke mainly to myself. ""Each saw a different person, a different reality, a reality that was even impressed upon the independent medium of the camera's sensor. But independent in what sense? Causally? Psychically?"" I turned to Janus. ""Is she a soul image do you think, Professor?"" Janus wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead and grimaced. Clearly he still found my loyalty to the Zurich School irritating, yet he had recommended me as his replacement, which I found puzzling. ""I thought you might suggest such a thing,"" he said, coldly. ""But half of these pictures were taken by women. The soul image is of the opposite gender to the host, is it not? On such a basis I would expect the women to see and take pictures of men. No, by any criterion this creature is female. Her appearance is to some extent determined by the individual, that much is obvious,… but it is not a projection, not a manifestation of the anima archetype,… not, my dear Adam, a soul image."" ""What about her psyche?"" ""It is strange."" ""How so? You mentioned nothing in the report."" ""There was nothing to mention. No chinks, no cracks. The creature is perfectly sane, to an inhuman degree."" ""There must be something! Even a residual childhood neurosis. There's always a way in, Professor."" ""Ordinarily that is true."" I looked again at the pictures. ""The datum markings on her body are the same,"" I observed, ""Only the physiology changes?"" ""That is correct. When she was first brought here she was clothed, not as you see her now, in her natural state. In those days, it was observed that the clothing remained always the same, also the ornamentation - the creature wore rings and various piercings, like any regular female. All of these things were found to be consistent, regardless of the observer. Only the biometrics are seen to change, from the surface of the skin inwards."" ""Do others report the same personality characteristics? You have done association tests?"" He seemed impatient, even irritated somehow as if he felt that all I was doing in questioning him was pointing out his failings in the matter. ""Yes, yes. Again inconclusive. The results always reflect the personality of whoever carries out the experiment. Yet, I swear underneath the surface, the psyche of this creature remains the same. It is simply a surface we cannot penetrate."" ""You keep referring to her as a creature."" ""This is the only conclusion I can draw."" ""Surely, DNA will reveal her origins."" ""Inconclusive,… like the photographs, and personality tests, it depends on who does the experiment."" The following morning, I bade farewell to the professor at the security shaft, and never a more dejected figure have I seen. ""Good luck, Adam,"" he said. ""You will need it."" After watching him leave, I returned to my consulting room. On the way, I encountered Pandora for the first time. She was being led along the connecting corridor between the detention unit and the medical section. She was wearing only a pair of brutish manacles and the place was bustling with staff. It struck me then as an infringement of basic decency, keeping her naked like that, especially in such a public place, but then I'd only been there a couple of days and had yet to make that crucial judgement concerning her humanity, or lack of it. The datum markings that had been made upon her body, using an indelible dye, also seemed an unnecessary degradation, as indeed were the curious looks of the non medical hangers-on, who obviously deemed her human enough for their own prurient purposes. I caught her eye briefly, just before they led her into the MRI suite and she gave me a look that signified something, a sort of recognition. I caught my breath, then the doors banged shut and she was led off to have the secrets of her vital organs probed. I remained rooted for some time, until I was eventually moved on by an officious military policeman. I tell you Richard, I had seen something reflected in that woman and I can only describe it as the purest image of my self. It was like looking in a mirror and knowing that what I saw actually existed somewhere beyond its reflective plane. I was utterly shaken by it. The following morning, being an authorised recipient, I studied that MRI report intently. But, as Janus had warned me, its conclusions were inconclusive, as were the conclusions of every biometric and psychological experiment that had thus far been performed upon her. The report cited problems with the scanner, which had resulted in certain inconsistencies. It was the same story with everything, from her appearance to the analysis of her bodily wastes. All the reports ever compiled on the phenomenon of Pandora clung doggedly to the desire to elucidate an explanation that was essentially rational, hence talk of faulty equipment and the need for more tests. But to my eye, they were missing the point. There was nothing wrong with the equipment, nor the procedures, and if we took the collated data at face value, then Pandora had to be classified as only generically human. The precise details, the nitty gritty of her personhood depended on who was doing the looking. I had gone over the DNA analysis and even there, the evidence of inherited characteristics matched those of whoever had studied the samples, as if in performing the experiment, the person had been staring back at their own prehistoric origins, their own ethnicity. The truth was plain for all to see, yet everyone was hiding behind the increasingly tattered curtain of scientific respectability. And the truth, my dear Richard is that there is no rational explanation to the phenomenon of Pandora. She was, is, in fantasy parlance, a shapeshifter, a sprite, a figment of the collective imagination - if there be such a thing. She is an anomaly of the first rate,… an effect without any apparent cause. I had my first consultation with her that same afternoon. It was only my second day at the bunker and already I was becoming disorientated by my life deep under the Yorkshire countryside. There was no natural daylight of course and even our air was recycled so as to disguise our topside emissions. They say even our American cousins are unaware of the location of that place and I can well believe it. She was brought into my consulting room by two strapping male nurses who fastened her manacles to the table between us. This meant she had to lean forwards in an uncomfortable and submissive manner. Though I found this distasteful, and questioned the procedure, I was told it was a necessary precaution, for my own safety. I was not entirely convinced and asked that as a concession she be clothed, if only to spare my own embarrassment. My request met with a snide expression from the security controller, as if it betrayed a weakness on my part, a kind of perversion that I should hold to any respectable values at all. In a somewhat half hearted response to my wishes Pandora had been thrust into a flimsy paper overall. I was not pleased by any of this, but there was little I could do to alter the utilitarian culture of the administration. Pandora, I'm afraid, was never anything more than a piece of meat to them at that time. In light of this, her disposition seemed rather more cheery than I would have expected. As soon as we were left alone her face cracked into what I can only describe as a cheeky grin. ""You're different,"" she said. ""Different?"" ""Where's Janus?"" ""Oh, he's rather busy. I'll be standing in for a few days."" ""Why you, I wonder?"" ""Why me?"" ""Why replace him with you? What's your speciality?"" ""What makes you think anyone has been replaced?"" Her manner was quite matter of fact and I felt completely wrong-footed by her. Her accent struck me as familiar, the same intonations as those I had grown up with in a Devon fishing village. There was no longer anything remarkable in this of course and I suspected that all who heard her would swear she spoke their mother tongue. ""I am just another psychiatrist. A former student of Professor Janus."" ""I see. And was he a good teacher?"" The consultation - I refute the term interrogation - was not going well. It was my role to act as the superior psyche, but already I was floundering and my questioning had not yet begun. ""Was Professor Janus a good teacher?"" she repeated. As you know Janus is considered to be a brilliant man, but rather a poor teacher - too bound up with his own theories to take much of an interest in his students. You may recall how we had been left to find our own way, some of us taking a more circuitous route to our doctorates than others. I strayed into the realms of psychological heresy, while you my dear Richard, strayed even further, throwing away your medical books and walking into the department of theoretical physics. How many times have I wished I had done the same thing? ""He was all right,"" I said, at which she smiled. ""By such faint praise one is damned, Doctor. You differed in some fundamental respect?"" ""Professor Janus' theories of the psyche have their roots in the Vienna School. My own leanings are towards Zurich and this did not always meet with his approval."" ""I see,"" she said, and yes my dear Richard, I believe she did see. I had not expected her to know what I was talking about, and thereby I had hoped to gain the upper hand for once, but she understood things perfectly well. ""Why am I wearing this unattractive paper suit?"" she asked.""I have not been allowed clothes for some time now. They seem interested in observing the marks on my skin."" ""You were dressed at my request."" ""Oh? The others seem not to mind interviewing me unclothed."" ""It puzzles me why that doesn't concern you."" I said, thinking it was time I made a start on testing for the cracks in her psyche, instead of her searching for the cracks in mine. ""I mean spending all your time being observed and moved around like that. Does it not make you feel vulnerable? Humiliated?"" ""What choice do I have? But, since you ask, I have no embarrassment about it and no practical need for clothes anyway because it is quite warm down here. I take it it is ""down"" somewhere? It is a sort of underground place? A prison for special suspects? People who are suspected of posing a serious but undefined threat. Only I have the impression I am the only one here, and it seems an awful lot of trouble to go to just for me."" I regarded her in silence. ""It's all right,"" she went on. ""I know you can't tell me anything. But so few people actually seem to want to talk to me. I used to look forward to my interviews with Professor Janus - not that I got anything out of him either. He was more concerned with his experiments which seemed to consist entirely of firing words at me and timing my responses."" I let out a deep breath, eased back in my chair and let her talk for a while. Eventually she picked up on my detachment and paused in mid stream, perhaps to check that I was still listening. ""I'm sorry, Doctor. You have some experiments you need to do as well? Please go ahead. I am ready. But if you told me what you were looking for, then perhaps I could arrange for it to appear in the results?"" I laid down my papers in defeat. By now, I was certain she did indeed possess the ability to adjust her psyche to suit whatever I was looking for. ""Let's forget it then, shall we?"" ""What else would you like to know?"" ""How about your real name."" ""Everyone just calls me Pandora."" ""And where are you from, Pandora? You sound like you're from the village where I grew up, but I suspect you're not."" ""You learn quickly. Such definitions hold no real meaning do they? I think you know that."" ""Pandora, wouldn't you like to get out of here?"" ""My dear Doctor, I was picked up on the edge of a battlefield in the Middle East, two years ago with no papers and no satisfactory explanation. I have no identity and no one knows I am here. Poor Pandora, she is going nowhere."" I had to agree, her analysis was probably correct. ""Perhaps if you cooperated, even just a little."" I was desperate now, but she remained unmoved. ""Any answers I can give are not likely to be understood. What you seem to want is something altogether more tangible than I can give , a truth that is testable, independently verifiable. But I don't deal in tangibles. I am what you might call a grey area."" ""Then I am your man,"" I said. ""I don't deal in tangibles either. Indeed my whole field of expertise is defined only by its infinite shades of greyness. Try me."" ""Yes my dear,"" she said. ""I shall try you,… in good time."" Conditions for staff at The Bunker were tolerable, with comfortable rooms and passable catering facilities, yet it was still a strict policy that non-military personnel were required to spend no longer than two weeks at a time underground. There were no exceptions and even though my work was pressing, I eventually found myself holed up at the Grand Hotel in Scarborough, a world away from the intrigue and the frustrations of Pandora. It was a blessed relief to be frank, and even the grey winter light seemed razor sharp in comparison to the neon-lit confines of The Bunker. I had arrived at the Grand with a few bags and a box of books. The weather was atrocious but no more than one can expect for January. I had a week to write up my notes and refresh my senses, and it appeared most of the time would be spent in my rooms, or the hotel lounge. It was after dinner, one evening towards the end of that week that I returned to my rooms to find a maid sitting cross legged upon my bed in the most impertinent manner. She was surrounded by the books she had taken from my box and was so engrossed in her reading, she did not even bother to look up when I approached. I was about to ask her what she thought she was doing when she halted my advance by gesturing with one gracefully upturned palm to the window seat. ""I've made you some tea,"" she said. My indignation was transformed at once into astonishment: It was Pandora! Slowly, I backed away, my fingers curling around the 'phone in my pocket, ready to dial emergency. ""They'll be looking for you,"" I warned, though mostly in self defence, hoping I could frighten her away. ""Who will they be looking for?"" she asked. ""You, Pandora."" ""But my name is Melanie,"" she said, and she pointed to her badge. ""See? M.E.L.A.N.I.E."" ""How did you get out? It's impossible."" ""Difficult enough, I grant you. And not really worth trying. Poor Pandora, she really is in a fix, isn't she? But Melanie's worked here for six months. You can ask at the desk."" She held up a thick volume on the history of the New Age movement. ""You like to read around your subject, I see. Or is this a purely recreational text - a bit heavy going though, isn't it? I much prefer a light romance for relaxation. You should get out more. Scarborough's a lovely town, even in mid-winter. "" I sank into an armchair and gazed at her. I tell you, Richard, I have never before felt such an upswell of irrational fear. As you know, all my life I have dallied with the possibility of the irrational. I have paddled my flimsy canoe into the most notoriously pseudo-scientific backwaters, all to Janus' perpetual disgust. I felt I could cope objectively with anything, even the manifestation of something that was patently impossible, but now I know I was mistaken. The rational, dear Richard, is no defence when exposed to the irrational. Indeed, it is our undoing. No matter how free we think our thoughts are, rationality is the one thing we return to when threatened by the unknown. ""What exactly are you?"" I asked. She shook her head and gave me a patient smile. ""What is it you think or fear that I might be?"" ""That you're extraterrestrial - or something."" ""Or something? Please define 'something'!"" ""I don't know. Its merely a conjecture."" She tossed the book on the floor between us where it landed with a resounding thump. Then the atmosphere became almost tangibly sinister. ""But what are your thoughts, my dear?"" ""I have no thoughts, only observations."" ""My! How careful we are with words! Then tell me your observations."" ""You exist in generic form, but lack the authentic inconsistencies that give rise to identity. These inconsistencies you manifest by acting as a psychic mirror, allowing others to project their own impressions, to see in you whatever they want to see."" ""So am I less than human then?"" ""It's not for me to draw a distinction, only to observe."" ""Ah! Yes, my dear. You and me both. Our task is to observe. But soon I must act and when I do, you will have no choice but to act as well, to guide as many who will listen."" ""Guide? To what?"" ""To the conclusion that all of what you consider to be reality, can in fact be transcended. This will be your only hope of escaping what is about to happen."" I did not pretend to understand what she meant, though I had an uneasy feeling I would shortly find out. ""Pandora was observing us when she was taken?"" ""Yes. Such a messy business, war. Your ability to ignore the sufferings of your fellow beings is remarkable, though, so far as I can see, a prerequisite for conducting many of your affairs. You seem slow to grasp the cosmic principle that one's true path in life is that which does not subvert the path of others."" ""We're not completely void of compassion,"" I told her. ""If we do inflict suffering on others it's usually in order to achieve a greater good."" She moved to the window and looked out to where the North Sea was pounding the beach. ""There are islands of calm,"" she mused, wiping away a layer of dust with her cleaning cloth. ""But the ocean grows ever more treacherous. And you are right: Sometimes we must think of the greater good."" She turned suddenly. ""Tomorrow is my day off. Walk out with me?"" ""But the weather is forecast is for storms tomorrow,… "" ""I think not,"" she replied and there was such a tone of certainty, of finality in her voice that I could not doubt her. Sure enough, in the morning, there was a clear blue sky, a calm sea and a low sun causing mist to rise from the damp sand, but stepping out onto the hotel terrace, I was at once aware that all was not well. Indeed it struck me that I might not yet be awake, that I was still in bed, dreaming. You were always a level headed sort of chap, Richard and therefore I understand how unlikely any of this will sound to you, but beyond the bounds of the hotel, Scarborough did not exist. There was another landscape, green and rolling. And it was no longer January, but high summer. Pandora, or Melanie, or whatever you want to call her appeared, walking up the steps towards me. She was dressed like a nineteen thirties movie star, in high heels, seamed stockings, a dark suit and a little hat with a feather. She might easily have passed for Myrna Loy in the film ""It Happened One Night"" - that same pugnacious energy. I was dressed it seems like Clark Gable, and sported a razor thin moustache. ""I thought it would be less traumatic for you if we did it this way,"" she said. I somehow doubted that, but there was clearly no going back now. There was a strange sense of reality having been rendered pliable, that no matter what absurdities I was presented with I would react to them in an entirely natural way. ""You're instructing me in a dream,"" I said. She smiled approvingly. ""Your willingness to work beyond the bounds of causality does you credit, Adam."" ""How do you know me? I've never used my name with you. They don't allow it."" Myrna Loy linked arms with Clark Gable, looked sideways at him and laughed. ""My dear,"" she said. ""I know everybody."" We walked at a leisurely pace through the hotel gardens, towards the beach. In a meadow close by, a carnival was taking place - roundabouts, waltzers and myriad sideshows, all squashed very closely together, and it was into this scene that she led me. ""Why these costumes,"" I remarked, observing the crowds. ""I'm fond of this period,"" she said. ""It's also useful for you to see things this way, a slight adjustment in your reality, but still tangible. This is the manifest content, as you would say - the motifs, the symbolism, the threads from which the tapestry of meaning is woven."" ""But if that is so, then you are the unknown woman in my dream, which makes you my soul image. Janus rejected that, and I agreed with him. You cannot be a soul image."" ""That is true, Adam - but then I am not entirely unknown to you . There are many unknown women here, all willing candidates for your soul image. Do you not see Ingrid Bergman watching you from the Cocks and Hens? Or Lauren Bacall, over there by the Waltzer? Were you alone, one of them would be sure to approach and become your psycho-pomp for the night, but they keep their distance, because they see that I am with you. Tonight, my dear, I shall be your guide."" ""Then you are an archetype? You are a focus for unconscious energy, of certain type."" ""I am an archetype, of sorts, yes, but I inhabit a realm that is deeper than the unconscious."" ""Deeper? Then you speak of the self?"" ""Deeper than the self."" ""But nothing is deeper than the self."" ""That is a very limited view, my dear, and one you will be shortly be called to think upon. But enough of that! Look at the moon, isn't it beautiful?"" I followed her outstretched arm to where a rose-tinted moon rode high above the headland. It was encircled by a plane of concentric rings, rather like Saturn. ""Interpret your dream for me thus far."" she said. I took a deep breath, then began my stringing together of associations: ""A different moon,… a different planet, a different world. You like this period, something about the time you said,… time, space, distance. When we look into space we look back in time. I also have the feeling there are 11 rings around the moon, though I haven't counted them."" ""Very good. We are looking back in time. 11 light years to be precise. This world is 11 light years away from earth. It is the third planet in a sytem not unlike your own."" ""This place really exists? I mean in a rock hard, tangible, fiery balled sun sort of way?"" ""Oh yes. It doesn't look exactly like this of course. This is just a dream remember. All the images to illustrate what I am teaching you come from your own memory. If anything, you would find it even more beautiful in reality."" ""But this is so far away, so long ago. How does this have anything to do with us?"" ""The people here are industrious,"" she began. ""They are also peaceful. A century ago, they stumbled upon a source of energy that would take them to their nearest neighbour, a less advanced people, barely a light year away, a distance they covered in a matter of weeks. They did this in a spirit of adventure, but on arrival deemed their neighbours to be ill prepared for the appearance of extra terrestrial beings, so they came and went without being seen, and they haven't been back."" ""They sound a very enlightened race."" ""They are indeed. That's why they've survived the discovery of the source."" She led me through the crowds to where a huge ""test your strength"" machine had been set up, and a moustachioed man in a top hat sat waiting. ""The source of the energy,"" she went on. ""It's a curious thing, quite simple to produce, and clean, yet enormously powerful. It is nothing less than tapping into the latent energy of the cosmos. It sounds complex but really anyone with a basic knowledge of physics and an average laboratory such as you might find in any school or university, could do it. When applied to space travel, this energy can be used to warp the space ahead of the vessel, compressing it, creating a tunnel if you like through which the vessel can travel vast distances in a short period of time."" ""It sounds too good to be true. Is this still the manifest content of my dream? Do I interpret this energy source as a symbol for something else?"" Melanie paused beside the moustachioed man and he handed her a huge mallet which she studied closely. ""The source is real enough. But of course, it creates something of a problem, depending on who discovers it."" ""Oh?"" ""Such a thing can be harnessed wisely, or it can destroy a world. It's one thing to warp the void of space, in order to ease the passage of a vessel, but to warp matter is to dissipate it. Imagine: every man and woman gathered here has the means to destroy their world, should they feel inclined - yet the thought never enters their heads. Any dispute, political, social, be it on the global scale or as insignificant as a domestic squabble between a man and his wife, could trigger Armageddon and wipe out the entire planet, but it never has."" She regarded me closely. ""You think that unnatural?"" ""In human terms, sadly, yes."" ""Yet it is the goal to which you aspire. Tell me do you think you shall ever attain it?"" ""We have a lot of problems to transcend - you've been observing us, so you know better than I the nature of those troubles. But in time, over many generations, centuries even, yes, I'm confident that is our destiny. One day we will be like these people. Otherwise it's all just a cruel joke. And I don't believe the cosmos is inherently cruel."" Melanie took the mallet and swung it down upon the plunger of the ""test your strength machine"". A cylinder of metal shot up the pole and rang the bell. The moustachioed man doffed his hat and handed her a teddy bear which she then gave to me. ""Your optimism is heart warming, Adam. But time is against you."" ""Time?"" ""Indeed, your time is up,"" she said. ""Telescopes on Earth are already studying the electromagnetic spectrum of this system. In the next decade, analysis will reveal this planet's blue green form, its oxygen based atmosphere. And in the latter part of the century, probes will be dispatched."" ""But it's eleven light years away! It might as well be on the other side of the universe as far as our technology is concerned. It would take hundreds of years for us to get here. I'd say we've little to gain from doing such a thing."" ""Would it interest you to know that in a deeper level of the place you call The Bunker, they are researching the possibility of storing human eggs indefinitely and then fertilising them automatically, by machine - hundreds, or thousands of years later? They are researching methods of automatically rearing the offspring, educating them, preparing them. Now,… I agree, with your current technology, it would take centuries for a vessel to reach here. But what does that matter if the landing party is only conceived once the ship is safely in orbit?"" What was she saying? That we had devised a means of artificially breeding human beings? That we could scatter our unfertilised seed to the four winds of the universe? That it it didn't matter if it took a hundred, or indeed a million years for the seed to fetch up on some foreign shore? That whenever the time was right, the seed would be fertilised and human life, human thought, human souls would spring out of the void? ""It's a monstrous idea,"" I said. ""Artificially breeding and sustaining a human cargo for the sole purpose of what? Colonisation? Such a thing would never be allowed."" We walked free of the crowds, and began to stroll across the sand, towards the sea. ""But if it were true, my dear?"" ""I take it this part of the dream is visionary in a literal sense."" I took a breath. ""The artificial gestation of human life for the purpose of colonising other worlds, centuries, or even millennia from earth? It's unthinkable. The colonists would grow up out there, in the creaky hull of their mothership, only surviving on the off chance that everything still worked, and that they could eventually get down to the planet's surface. Who knows what horrors they might endure? It's one way of propagating the species of course, but it would never be sanctioned. It's inhuman."" ""But no one would know these children of earth. They would be a mere potential, a seed when they departed. Why should anyone mourn them if they failed? They would not be human when they departed, only when they arrived."" I knelt down and sifted the sand between my fingers. It was real sand, earth sand, the sand I had made castles with in years gone by upon the beaches of my childhood. Might it really come to that, I wondered? Might we one day rain down from the skies of worlds as far away as this? ""This is an advanced society,"" I said. ""They have a collective psyche quite unlike ours, capable of handling a destructive energy without the slightest risk of harming themselves. They'd see us coming. They'd have decades to prepare for it. They could prevent it."" ""These people would never take a life, or prevent its causation. It would be seen as an interference with their own fate. It is simply their way."" ""Then if they're so altruistic, they could find a way of assimilating a few human beings."" ""But dare we let that human seed reach this far? In a few generations, might not the psyche of this world be irretrievably corrupted? Might they not begin thinking of weapons?"" ""Not all humans think of weapons."" ""Yes they do. And thereby a species usually extincts itself long before it learns the secrets of artificial reproduction. Usually the source is discovered before the collective psyche is adapted to deal with it and thus the problem solves itself. But in the case of humankind, you appear to have found a way to escape your necessary quarantine."" ""But if our arrival here is fated, which is what you seem to be telling me, then nothing can prevent it."" ""I can prevent it,"" she said. ""How can you alter fate?"" ""Because I am fate, my dear,"" she said. ""I am the way. I am the light that guides you. I am the one that gave you form."" ""And you can destroy us?"" ""Of course, though I'm sure I can safely rely on you to do that for yourselves. And these people have passed the test. They are deserving of another world. Earth would suit them very well,… if it were ever to become,… shall we say,… vacant?"" I woke to the sound of rain against my window as a thin, grey light crept into my hotel room. Melanie was sitting in the window seat, leafing through a romantic novel, while intermittently gazing over her shoulder at the North Sea, cold and black, thundering upon the beach. She told me that in an hour I would be recalled to the bunker, that I would be dismissed without reason, but that I should not blame myself. The administration, she explained, had given in to pressure from Washington, and that the creature known as Pandora was already bound for a certain bunker deep below the hills of Pennsylvania. And what, I asked, was to be our fate? ""Hush now, my dear,"" she replied. On the pillow beside me lay the teddy bear. I knew then what was coming and I gathered it to me, lay my face against its soft fur and closed my eyes. There I remained until I was disturbed by the ringing of a telephone. Melanie was still with me, watching quietly - my role in her scheme apparently not yet complete - though, incredible as it might seem to you, her chimerical counterpart, Pandora was already on a flight bound for America. It does not surprise me then my dear Richard that you now speak of Pandora in the same letter in which you also outline your remarkable discovery of a limitless energy source. You have tapped into the very energy of the cosmos. The administration may deem it too dangerous a thing of course and attempt to suppress all knowledge of it other than for military purposes, but we both know the collective nature of such things and that knowledge of it will leak out by other means. This is something that might easily have carried us to the stars, but as Pandora or Melanie reminds me we are certain of destroying ourselves with it before even our fledgeling starships have left the drawing board. It puts the power of the atom into the hands of every ego-centric psyche on the planet. God help us! Only the fittest might visit other worlds, as we have dreamed of doing, but first they must face a test - one we shall shortly fail. It is not the fittest intellect that shall grant us access to the stars, but the fittest psyche, which is somewhat different. You cannot undo what you have discovered, nor must you blame yourself my dear Richard. It was Pandora who granted you the key that opened the box, for you to peer inside at secrets she deemed prudent to divulge. I remember that conversation I had with her upon a beach one summer long ago. And though it was only a dream, I caught, amongst its manifest content, a glimpse of something I have been searching for for a long time: it was an absence of fear, an acceptance of my role and an acceptance too of my inability to control my fate. You may remember Janus teaching us that even the simplest of neuroses cannot be cured by physical means. If we fear spiders, we cannot cure that fear by exterminating all spiders, nor by merely avoiding them. Instead we must find a way of transcending the fear, of simply not minding spiders any more. All our lives, our psychological development requires us to transcend our fears. It was your fate to secure the annihilation of mankind, while mine it seems is to teach as many who will listen how we might, if not exactly avoid our fate, at least transcend our condition, so that we do not mind it so much any more. To this end I suspect Pandora is not entirely without compassion, and among the demons in that box I think, as legend suggests, we will also discover a kind of hope. As I write, Melanie reminds me she will gift me the knowledge to see this through to the end, and in our final moments clasp me to her bosom,… as I am certain Pandora will equally be there,… … ..to comfort you.

20,00011,unknown,"Jeremy’s classmates were going to play footie in the park after school again. More than anything, he wanted to join them. ""What about asking the new kid,"" he heard Mary Robson say, nodding in Jeremy’s direction. ""Nah, he’s too stuck-up,"" someone said and they all ran off leaving Jeremy alone. But he wasn’t alone for long. A dog followed him from the school gates to the park where he secretly watched the game from behind the trunk of a big oak. The same dog had followed him the last three days. It greeted Jeremy like an old friend, wagging its tail and barking. ""They think I’m stuck up but I’m not, I’m shy,"" Jeremy told his only friend. He was in no hurry to go home. His parents were both lawyers and usually worked late. Their housekeeper Mrs Peacock made his tea and always complained he got under her feet. So she wasn’t bothered if he didn’t rush home. The dog had no collar or name tag, so Jeremy called him Rufus after a dog in a book he’d read. Rufus was big with a white coat and black ears. He looked like no breed Jeremy knew and he had the strangest eyes as if he understood every word Jeremy said. One of the boys picked up the loose ball ran the length of the makeshift pitch and shot at goal. The shot went yards wide of the jumper goalposts. ""I wish I was playing,"" Jeremy said. Rufus cocked his head on one side. ""It’s all right for you. Everybody loves dogs. I wish I was one."" Rufus yelped and jumped up, planting his front paws on Jeremy’s chest. Then the strangest thing happened. Everything went black. It was like someone had put out all the lights. Seconds later when everything returned to normal Jeremy couldn’t believe his eyes. There was another Jeremy standing in front of him. He was huge. Jeremy only came up to his stomach. ""Who are you?"" stammered Jeremy. ""Woof!"" came the reply Jeremy took a shocked step back. Then he got another surprise. Instead of wearing white trainers, he had white, shaggy paws. Somehow he had swapped places with Rufus. ""Wow"" cried Jeremy. It must have happened when Rufus jumped up. But how? Rufus barked and lay on his back with his arms and legs in the air. He barked for Jeremy to tickle him on the stomach. He might look like a boy but he was still acting like a dog. Automatically Jeremy scratched him with his newfound claws. It felt strange and he was careful not to hurt him. ""Is that good?"" he asked. ""Woof!"" said Rufus, a look of ecstasy on his face. Jeremy laughed, then shot a look around to see if anyone was watching. What would they think if they saw a dog tickling a boy’s stomach? There was no one apart from the boys and girls playing football and they were hidden by the tree. Before Jeremy knew what he was doing, he was running towards the game, his long white hair flying in the breeze. He leaped between Simon Hill and Jimmy Green, catching the ball in midair on his black, shiny nose. ""Hey, what’s going on?"" the two boys shouted. Jeremy took no notice. He ran with the ball towards the goal, dribbling with his head. Several players tried to cut him off but he shot around them. The goal loomed. The goalie, Steve Watson, came off the line to tackle him. Jeremy tipped his wet nose down, then flipped it up quickly and the ball rocketed over Steve’s head, over the line. ""Yeeees!"" cried Jeremy, forgetting that he was a dog and that dogs can’t talk. Fortunately no one heard him above the noise of his classmates’ shouts, cheers and claps. ""We could do with him on the team,"" shouted Mary Robson. Jeremy was so pleased he couldn’t stop his tail wagging. After scoring a few more goals, Jeremy trotted back to Rufus. ""Did you see that Rufus?"" he asked the other Jeremy. ""Woof!"" Just then a ginger cat emerged from a rhododendron bush, arched its back and hissed at Jeremy. Rufus pulled back the corner of his mouth in a snarl, then barked and the cat ran off. Like a bullet being fired from a gun, Rufus raced after it. ""Heel Rufus. Heel,"" shouted Jeremy but Rufus ignored him. Rufus chased the cat out of the park and across the road. Jeremy dashed after Rufus and the cat, crashing through several gardens before the ginger fled up a Silver Birch. From a high branch it hissed down at Rufus. As Jeremy came panting on the scene, Rufus was leaping at the tree, barking, and clawing the bark with his hands. ""Down Rufus. Down,"" ordered Jeremy. Rufus was a mess. It had rained earlier and he had got Jeremy’s new uniform filthy tearing through gardens and hedges after the cat. Jeremy noticed his shirt was ripped and groaned. His mother would kill him. Rufus stopped leaping at the tree and doubled over panting. ""Oh, you poor boy,"" said a white-haired old lady who came round the corner. ""Are you ill?"" Jeremy opened his mouth to say something, then quickly shut it. The old woman would probably have a heart attack if she heard a talking dog. To his horror, Rufus crouched on his hands and knees and drank thirstily from a puddle of water. ""You disgusting boy,"" the old lady cried and flounced off. ""Stop before someone else sees,"" Jeremy pleaded. ""Woof!"" said Rufus. It had been fun being a dog, but now Jeremy wanted to change back before Rufus got him into serious trouble. ""There you are. I’ve been looking for you everywhere."" Jeremy swung around to see Mrs Peacock waddling up. He was about to speak when he remembered he was still Rufus. ""Good grief!"" she cried, noticing his uniform. "" Whatever happened? You look like you’ve been dragged through a hedge backyards."" Rufus cocked his head on one side. ""Well, why don’t you answer?"" she demanded. ""Sulking are we? Well that’s just fine. You can explain your torn uniform to her Lady… I mean your mother. Come on let’s get you home."" She took Rufus by the arm and headed for home. All Jeremy could do, was trot behind them. Jeremy’s parents were going to a meeting and wanted dinner early. That’s why Mrs Peacock was sent to find him. The only thing was, she took Rufus home instead. Jeremy tried to get in the house but she chased him away. ""A dog in the house,"" she tutted. ""Mrs Turner would have a fit."" From outside the dining room window, Jeremy watched. His parents were too busy talking about work to notice Rufus was not speaking. Rufus sniffed the plate Mrs Peacock put in front of him. Then he began licking the gravy. Gravy, peas and slices of carrots spilled all over the spotless white tablecloth. Jeremy clamped his paws on his head, helpless to do anything. Incredibly his parents hadn’t noticed. They were still talking. Jeremy watched as Rufus picked up his piece of steak in his teeth and shook it. Gravy splattered all over the white wall. The steak fell to the ground and Rufus crouched on the floor and ate it. Mrs Peacock came in, let out a loud squawk and dropped the tray she was carrying. ""Jeremy I demand an explanation for this,"" his mother demanded. ""Woof!"" answered Rufus. ""Answer your mother this instant,"" his father said. ""Woof!"" said Rufus. Rufus was sent to bed early. The next day when he continued to bark instead of speaking he was kept off school. ""Think of the scandal if this gets out,"" said Jeremy’s mother. Listening at the window Jeremy felt more alone than ever. He spent the night in an empty dog kennel down the street. Next day, he hung about the house watching and listening but unable to get near Rufus. After school he went to the park and played footie with his classmates. They made a fuss of him, stroked him, tickled his stomach and fed him sweets. This went on for a few days. His parents were at their wit’s end. Jeremy had always been a model son. He’d never given them a minute’s worry. The last straw came when Mrs Peacock caught Rufus drinking the toilet water. Jeremy’s frantic parents called the doctor. ""He won’t speak. Just barks, you say,"" said Dr Harper. ""Now Jeremy you can tell me what’s the matter."" ""Woof!"" ""I can’t help you if you won’t speak."" ""Woof!"" The doctor scratched his chin. He looked at Jeremy’s parents. ""Has he shown any other strange symptoms?"" They told him about the toilet water, that he would only eat and sleep on the floor and how Mrs Peacock had caught him cocking his leg against the furniture. ""Doctor, we are worried sick,"" said Mrs Turner. ""Do you know what is wrong with him?"" ""I believe I do. I just want to make an examination first."" He checked Rufus’ blood pressure and put his stethoscope on his chest. While he was doing this Rufus covered his face with big slobbering licks. Jeremy’s mother sank into a chair and put her head in her hands. ""Well everything appears normal,"" said the doctor, drying his face on a towel. ""It’s just as I thought. A clear case of attention-seeking."" ""Attention-seeking,"" repeated Jeremy’s parents. ""You told me you both work long hours and that you don’t spend much time with your son,"" said the doctor. ""Well, this is his way of grabbing your attention. Basically he’s feeling neglected."" ""So what can we do?"" asked Jeremy’s father. ""I suggest you start spending time with your son before he develops deep psychiatric problems,"" the doctor said. Jeremy’s parents were partners in Turner, Turner and Strong. They rang Mr Strong and told him there was a family crisis and that they were leaving the business in his capable hands for a few days. Over the next week they took Rufus to funfairs, the cinema and went ten-pin bowling. They tried to indulge his every whim. The problem was that they had to guess what his every whim was because whenever they asked him, he just barked. Jeremy found all this out by eavesdropping. He laughed when he heard how they’d been thrown off the Ghost Train because Rufus had howled in the tunnel and terrified everyone. Each day, Jeremy continued to pass the time playing footie and scrounging food from wherever he could. No school, doing exactly what he wanted and no one to tell him off. It was a dog’s life. Trading places with Rufus had other pluses. He’d shaken off his shyness and had made lots of new friends. From what he’d heard at the window Jeremy knew that his parents remained hopeful that one day soon their son would start acting normally. They got their wish one Saturday, when Rufus gave them the slip and met up with Jeremy in the park. ""Rufus, it’s been cool being a dog, but I’d really like to be me again,"" Jeremy told him. ""Woof!"" said Rufus placing his hands on Jeremy’s shaggy chest. Everything went black for a moment and when the light came back Jeremy was back to his old self. Mr and Mrs Turner were delighted to have their son back to normal. They promised to get another partner so they would not have to work so hard and could spend more time with Jeremy. To celebrate they asked Jeremy to name anything he wanted. Without hesitation Jeremy said: ""A dog."" ""Oh, I don’t think___"" began his mother. ""Excellent,"" interrupted his father. ""Just what you need, a companion."" ""But the hairs and the dirty paws… "" cried Mrs Turner, then caught the stern look in her husband’s eyes. ""Well, if you must. Perhaps a nice little poodle. They don’t cause a mess."" ""I was thinking something like this… "" said Jeremy going to the door and bringing in Rufus. Monday morning Jeremy went to school and was mobbed by his classmates who wanted to know why he’d been off so long. He told them the story his parents had made up about a family crisis. After school Rufus was waiting for Jeremy. His classmates were heading for the park to play footie. On an impulse Jeremy asked: ""Can we come and play?"" ""Is that your dog? asked Johnny Green. Jeremy nodded. ""Well, if you can play as good as he can, we want you on the team,"" said Steve Watson. ""Come on."" Jeremy beamed. If he’d had a tail he would have wagged it. ",candidate00001
21,00013,unknown,"Jen woke up chained to a rock. This was not where the thirteen-year-old girl had gone to sleep. Actually Jen couldn’t remember where she had gone to sleep, but it was not attached to a blackened stone in the middle of Don’t-Go-In-There-Wood. Around her towered dark trees blocking all but a hazy glow from the bright summer’s day. She sat in a clearing made up of burnt tree stumps. Jen had been told about what lived in Don’t-Go-In-There-Wood, it burnt things, it crushed things and it ate people. Jen felt the iron collar locked to her neck, her fingers couldn’t make it move. A heavy chain from the collar ended in an iron stake hammered into the stone. It wouldn’t budge even when she put all her weight behind it. It was while she was pulling, that the dragon arrived for a Jen-flavoured snack. ‘Eek!’ she eek-ed. Leathery wings beat the air like thunder and a dark body the size of twenty cows strapped together arrived with the sound of twenty cows landing in the clearing. Wood cracked like cockroaches under a boot. Jen spun round to face the dragon. Its head was as long as Jen’s body, its eyes as big as her face. Looking at her sideways because its long teeth-filled mouth got in the way, it licked its lips with a pink forked tongue. ‘Tasty,’ it said in a growl that made Jen’s body tremble on top of the trembling she was already doing. ‘I think there’s been a mix-up,’ Jen said, giving the chain a hopeful tug. ‘Oh yes?’ ‘It’s princesses dragons eat isn’t it?’ ‘Oh, I eat all sorts of things, cows, pigs, cabbages and so on, but when the need arises a chomp on a princess doesn’t go amiss.’ ‘I am not a princess. I’m a maid. I do the washing up, make beds and carry food. So you can see there’s been a terrible mix-up.’ ‘I get one princess chained to this rock every generation and in return I don’t burn any of the villages in the kingdom, well, don't burn them with people in them.’ ‘I’m not a princess,’ Jen tried again. ‘You want my mistress, Princess Aileen.’ ‘You are chained to the rock.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘You’re wearing a gown fit for a princess.’ ‘Er… yes.’ ‘You’ve even got a dainty crown and that makes you a princess.’ ‘Ah… no, you see… ah… I can see where the mistake has happened. I was wearing Princess Aileen’s dress ’cause it let her see how she would look. She was very nice about it. She even got me a drink, which is really my job, but — the crafty cow! She drugged me! No wonder no one talks about the maid I replaced. That cow, when I see her again, I don’t care whether her father is the king, I’m going to tell her what I think of her.’ ‘Ahem.’ ‘Yes?’ ‘All very clever princess, but I don’t believe it. Prepare to be fried.’ He drew in a huge breath. Jen leapt over the rock and ducked down as far as the chain would allow. Flames struck the rock roaring around Jen as she huddled. It went quiet. The dragon pulled on the chain with a giant claw and dragged Jen to him. She tried to pull back, but his strength was far more than one tricked maid. ‘You are not playing ball.’ ‘I don’t want to be eaten. Anyhow, you are going to have trouble eating me, I mean my clothes are going to taste awful.’ ‘Never had a problem before,’ he replied. ‘Quick puff of flame and you get cooked like a jacket potato.’ Jen thought fast. ‘Chain. This collar, I can’t get it off, it’ll break a tooth or something. You don’t want that.’ ‘I find that after I’ve cooked a princess—’ ‘I am not a princess.’ ‘— a quick pull and the head comes right off, no problem with the collar.’ ‘I feel sick. I have to sit down.’ Jen slumped onto the rock. ‘Fine, you sit there, helps my aim.’ ‘Wait, wait, I must be more useful alive than toasted. I’m a maid; I do lots of things. What can I do for you?’ ‘Sit still for about two seconds and I can do the rest.’ Jen sighed, ‘Could you answer one question, before you eat me?’ ‘This is very irregular. I think I can wait. I don’t like tricks, no saying it’s going to take twenty years to think up a question.’ ‘Rats,’ she said and quickly tried to think of a hard question. In the end she gave up and asked the first question that popped into her mind. ‘Why do you burn villages? You don’t eat anyone while the villages burn. Answer me that.’ ‘Scale rot.’ ‘That’s not an answer.’ ‘I suffer from scale rot. When you get to be a big dragon, it’s hard to get to all those nooks, especially under the scales. Scale rot is awful especially when you can’t get at it. I have found that burning reeds smoke out the beasties that makes me itch and reduces the old rot. Only reeds in reed beds are wet, but you humans put them on wooden frames to dry out and they burn up a treat.’ ‘Those wooden frames are houses. You keep burning down our houses! Someone should do something about it.’ ‘They do. They give me a princess to eat and I bother someone else. Happy with the answer?’ He asked, considering whether it was worth drawing in a roasting breath or was his meal going to ask another question. Jen said nothing. She was thinking. The collar was rubbing her neck sore. As sore as a dragon with scale rot. ‘Happy?’ he asked again optimistically. Keep preparing for a flaming and then being stopped by this awkward dinner was giving him heartburn. ‘I can clean your scales. I’m used to doing dirty jobs. Get me a branch with some leaves on it and I’ll get to work,’ Jen ordered. ‘You don’t have to work, just sit there and I can—’ ‘You need a good clean and I can give you that cleaning.’ ‘This is some trick to help you escape,’ he challenged suspiciously. ‘I’m chained to a rock.’ ‘Good point.’ He reach out one of his claws gripped the nearest tree and ripped it from the ground. ‘Will this do?’ ‘A branch, something I can use to get under your scales, not a whole tree.’ The dragon used its teeth to bite off a few branches of a manageable size. Jen selected a good cleaning branch. ‘Now get closer because I can’t reach.’ He sidled up to Jen raising one of his great wings for her to get under. ‘Pooh, what a stink,’ she said. ‘Four legs, two wings equals six armpits,’ he explained. Ignoring the smell Jen pushed up her sleeves and set to work. Bristling his scales allowed her to dig in the brush. Cockroaches, wood lice and all sorts of spiders made their homes under the armour of the beast. They rained on the maid as she poked into the gaps between scales. Jen sneezed quite a bit, but she continued with her task. When one branch wore out, looking like candyfloss made out of dirty spider’s webs, Jen picked up another. After hours of work a brown dragon had become a green one with yellow patterns. The dragon stepped back so Jen, still held by the chain, could view her handiwork. Hands on hips she was satisfied. ‘Some metal polish could make those scales really shine. A bit of saddle soap on the wings and you’d be getting Valentines from all the lady dragons in the country.’ ‘You’ve finished?’ ‘Yes.’ The dragon reversed and drew a deep breath. ‘Wait!’ Jen screamed. Coughing hot smelly air, the dragon thumped his armoured chest with a fist. ‘Stop doing that, it hurts,’ he complained. ‘You can’t eat me after all I’ve done for you.’ ‘I can, it’s easy.’ ‘Are princesses your favourite food?’ Jen asked with fingers crossed. ‘No, far too skinny.’ ‘What if I keep you clean and saw you got as much of your favourite food as you wanted. Would that be worth not eating me?’ Jen was giving him indigestion before eating her. He considered it might be worse if he did. ‘Yes,’ he said doubtfully. ‘Then I’m going to need a little help.’ Astride the dragon, Jen clutched his neck scales as he flew over the woods. He stayed low so the tops of the trees tickled his tummy. Jen couldn’t stop herself from saying ‘Wheeeeeeee!’ as the air rushed by and a cloud of leaves followed their flight. ‘What’s your name?’ ‘Jimius De Forgebreath Knightburner the Fourteenth,’ said the dragon. ‘I’ll call you Jim.” Soon they were over farmland. Below people ran away from their houses for fear of being roasted. Animals scattered everywhere. Quickly Jim passed the farms and carried on to the first of the towns. Bells rang out and people ran away. In the distance was a castle. Tall spires and high walls were good enough to stop an army of knights in armour, but lacked effective anti-dragon defences. Knowing the drill, guards were running away as the flying monster loomed up. ‘That’s where I used to work.’ Jen shouted against the wind. ‘The audience chamber is in the middle of the biggest tower.’ ‘Right oh.’ Jim swung round the largest tower. ‘The doors are too small.’ ‘Dragons make their own doors!’ ‘Whoa!’ Too late, Jim dived toward a wall of hard looking stones. The crash was so loud Jen thought she was standing beside herself. Dust was everywhere while stones rattled off floors and walls. It cleared slowly with the sound of the explosion ringing in the maid’s head. The dragon filled the king’s grand audience chamber. The red carpet had been bunched up until it was like a screwed up hanky. Stone blocks the size of coffee tables rested randomly over the polished wooden floor that was now covered in more scratches than if someone had tried to wax it with a sack full of angry cats. Looking dazed was the royal family. They had been discussing replacement maids. King Albert sat dumbstruck on his dusty throne. Queen Roberta was hiding under her upturned chair. Princess Aileen, who did look a lot like Jen, was sitting on the floor with an expression of a girl who has been slapped with a wet sock. Jen slid off the dragon. Noticing a smudge on a scale she stopped to polish it with her sleeve. ‘Oh foul beast, what do you demand of us?’ asked the king, shivering with fright. ‘It’s me, your majesty, it’s Jen,’ she said knocking as much dust off her clothes as she could. The king peered at her with no idea who Jen was. To him all maids were called ‘girl’. Princess Aileen started crawling to the door beside the thrones. ‘I have come to say I’ve stopped the dragon from burning our villages.’ ‘Ah, right, very good,’ said the king, mind on the repair bill for his audience chamber. ‘You must be rewarded with the hand of my daughter in marriage and half my kingdom.’ ‘I’m a girl.’ ‘Oh right, ah… the marriage thing doesn’t work does it?’ Princess Aileen found a large stone had jammed the door shut. She began crawling toward an exit at the back of the chamber. ‘This is what I want and if I don’t get it, my friend here will go back to his old ways,’ Jen said. ‘Name anything, can’t have villages burning, bad for… er… bad for villages, what?’ Jen turned to look at Aileen who was failing to be invisible. Jim turned his head as well. ‘Not leaving are we?’ Jen asked. ‘Very important princess business,’ Aileen said, ‘need to be—eek!’ Jim sucked in a deep breath and Aileen began sliding toward his jaws. Madly grabbing at the floor the girl moved backwards. More securely than being chained to a rock, Princess Aileen stuck to Jim’s left nostril. ‘Must let breath out,’ Jim warned. Jen yanked the princess clear as a jet of flame shot out of the dragon and burned a neat hole in the nearest wall. Sinking to the floor like a balloon with a leak, Princess Aileen fainted. ‘Back to business,’ Jen said, hands on hips. ‘I am now the Kingdom’s official Dragon Cleaner. This is a dangerous and difficult job so I will need to be paid more than a maid, I think five pence a day. Also I need some things to make my job easier.’ King Albert stood up and picked plaster out of his robes. Kings get to be kings in all sorts of ways, but they stay kings by making deals. Wall-smashing girls with fire-breathing friends were scary, but making deals was normal kingly work. ‘Jen, is it?’ He asked walking over to her. ‘I’m sure we can come to an arrangement.’ ‘So do I,’ she replied. ‘First, I want a delivery of thatch, enough to re-roof my house, every—’ she looked over to Jim. ‘Two months,’ said Jim. ‘— two months.’ ‘Five pence a day, thatch every two months, got it,’ said the king. ‘I’ll need a regular supply of cows to feed the dragon.’ ‘Of course.’ ‘The cows will need dresses and crowns because they will be princess cows.’ ‘Did you say princess cows?’ Jen leaned closer and whispered, ‘It’s a dragon thing, they have to eat princesses, but who said they had to be human?’ ‘Cow princesses, check.’ ‘Finally, this job will take up all my time and if my toilet gets blocked, which happens quite a lot, I need someone to clean it out. I’d like that person to be Princess Aileen.’ ‘As soon as Aileen wakes up I’ll enrol her in a City and Guild’s course in plumbing.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Anything else?’ Jen asked for nothing else because she knew that happiness was having a dragon for a friend and someone else to clean out her toilet.

22,00014,unknown,"Danny was scared – as scared as only a four-going-on-five-year old whose active imagination sees monsters and murderers lurking behind every object that swam in and out of sight amongst the thick, clinging miasmic mist that shrouded his immediate world. He was lost. He was sure that home was just “over there” maybe a hundred metres away, but every time he got to “over there” he found he was still lost. He had sneaked out of bed, out his window, and had been trying to get to the farm at the outskirt of town. His friends Tommy and Chris were camping out there in the tree hut that they'd been building there over the fading days of summer. But he didn't realise that he was heading almost exactly in the opposite direction - turned around by the dis-orienting tendrils of the enveloping vapour. The bright yellow slash of his torch was no help, swallowed by the murk mere metres from the bulb, and his young heart was pounding at every shape that seemed to suddenly lunge out at him as yet another swirl of that dampening veil roiled away at his cautious approach. Normally at night there would be sounds to add to his imagination, but the thick white-grey blanket had muffled the usual voice of the night, and the deadness was almost worse than the noises from ill-imagined sources. He kicked a stone and the dull “thock” as it hit the side of a brick fence further along the path seemed to come from the other side of the road. His sense of direction was totally messed up by the ethereal sworls. He was about as desperate as he had ever been and wondering what on earth he was going to do, when across the road, he thought he glimpsed what looked like a farm fence. He gingerly crossed the road, glancing left and right continuously, straining but not trusting any of his senses 100% in this thick fog. His heart picked up a bit when he got to the fence – rough-sawn slabs with the orignal tree trunk outlines still with their bark forming the edges, spaced fairly wide apart. It DID look like a farm fence – more like a horse farm than any other which might have featured a multi-strand wire fence, and there were no houses on the other side. He must have reached the edge of town and now, once again he figured he knew where he was. He convinced himself he'd seen horses in the paddock next to where they'd built the treehouse, so if he went into the field about 50 metres and kept parallel to the fence, he should soon come to the treehouse in the next paddock. His spirits rose again with this encouraging thought. Once again he was the brave explorer - his favourite hero Baden-Powell. He unslung his backpack and pushed it through the gap in the fence planks along with his stick (every adventurer always had an adventuring stick with them!), then wriggled through after it. Once on the other side, he slipped back into the straps of his bag, shrugged it up a little higher on his back, and strode off into the field, angling towards where he thought the treehouse was. After a few more seconds he turned fully to his right and strode directly towards it. Only there was a nagging little doubt at the back of his head telling him that it still didn't feel quite right … After about 5 more minutes he knew it wasn't right. There were too many shrubs and smaller trees dotted around what he had thought was the farm paddocks. And then he noticed a low hedge in his way edging a crushed stone path heading off towards his left – further into “the paddock” that he now knew wasn't. Having no better idea about what to do, Danny decided to follow the path. Paths are made by people to go somewhere, so even if he was lost, somewhere down that path would be someone who could help him. But it was still an unknown place and largely invisible wrapped and shrouded as it was with the obscurring haze. As he crunched hesitantly along the path, Danny noticed that perhaps he was going into a forest as the trees seemed to thicken up and become taller, and more powerful. The occasional dark, towering giant was holding up the sky and their longer, reaching, branches tried to snag and grab hold of his hair and his back-pack as he passed under their unseen canopy. Nearer to the trees, the tenuous vapours intensified into something more substantial, and the moisture laden tendrils snaked around him more frequently, dampening his clothes and skin and deadening the sound of the gravel. The fear rose up in him again, and settled in his throat so that he was constantly swallowing to hold down the sourness. The bold adventurer had gone and Danny's eyes were darting everywhere as he imagined all the terrors that a small boy can imagine lurking in the wisps and deeper scudding cloak of clouds surrounding him. Then out of the soup just ahead of him he saw a monster alien shape straddling the path. In the first instant he saw it, indistinct and threatening, he imagined it was the legs and belt of a huge ogre and his heart leapt even further into his mouth. His stomach churned and fizzed in an involuntarily reaction like a tiny chunk of sodium dropped in water, but then, a half second later, the mists seemed to magically clear around the uncertain shape and he could see the whole of it. It was something he had never seen before – kind of alien but also strangely human and reassuring. He had no idea what it was. The 'legs' were two poles, slightly slanting in towards each other off the vertical. These poles were connected across the top with another pole that extended past the uprights, somewhat like the old cowboy ranch gates he had seen on the old westerns on TV but again completely unlike them at the same time. In fact there were two slim poles, one above the other with the top one lightly curved – somewhat like an upside down longbow, but with the curve not so pronounced. And in the centre, where he'd thought he'd seen the ogre's belt buckle, there was a central board or plaque with some kind of ancient runes or symbols etched deeply in to it. Danny had no clue what it was, but for some reason he felt a peacefulness around it as he got closer. It seemed like a calmness had settled upon him at the same time that the fog had oozed away, leaving him floating in a little bubble of tranquility. He stopped just short of it and stared, sweeping his eyes up the majestic legs to the cross beams atop them, then down the other side. It was a simple structure, but in its simpleness, he sensed a singular power. Something to chase away any evils. His heart stilled. His panic subsided and was gone. He stepped over to the nearest upright pole and stroked his hand up it in curious wonder. He imagined he felt a magical power rippling out from the simple smooth wood. He would be safe here. It was the most certain feeling he'd ever had. He sat propped against the foot of the pole, his back soaking up the power radiating from it. After a few reassuring minutes Danny felt the weariness descend, stealing into the places that the fear and panic had been before. He took off his back-pack and pulled out his sleeping bag. Flicking it open, he took off his shoes and climbed inside. Then, pulling off his bulky sweatshirt and stuffing it into his back-pack, he snuggled all the way into the padded bed-tube, pulling it up tight around his chin. Then, settling his head down on the backpack, he lay on his back with his eyes soaking up the strangeness of this unwordly construction that straddled his supine form like a protective guardian. Slowly his eyes drooped shut and he drifted off to a restful sleep. As his eyes closed and his breathing steadied, a change started taking place in the air around the Torii Gate. The wooden structure which had seemed to be holding back the mist from its form up until now, started to pull wispy tendrils towards it as if it were a Geisha girl drawing a gauzy veil across her face. After a few minutes the top beam of the gate was almost invisible behind a thick blanket of fog. All of a sudden there was a sound like a clap of thunder and a feeling of hardness came into the air. Danny came to a startled state of half awake, wondering what was happening. Looking up at the wooden structure, he thought that once again it looked as it had in that first half instant – like the legs of a giant ogre whose belt buckle was now shining. This time however the impression did not go away and turn into the form of the Torii Gate. This time, as the vapourous haze swirled around the form, he glimpsed more ogre-like features. There was some substance of form above the upper beam that hadn't been there before, and as he struggled to wake more fully, and free his arms from the shroud-like wrap of his sleeping bag, he glimpsed a giant hand swinging down through the smoky funk. As he opened his mouth to scream, the shape-shifting torii-ogre snatched the young adventurer out of his sleeping bag, squeezing the breath out of his lungs. In an instant it was done, and Danny was no more to be seen. The befuddling steam swirled again around the form, and then with a kind of sideways “crack”, the gate was back and the ogre gone – back to its alternate dimension, leaving the mysterious scene of a quiet park, with an empty sleeping bag, a back-pack and a pair of shoes beneath a simple ornamental gate. And the young owner of these articles, would never be seen again. For you see, a gate of power often leads to hidden places, and the fog hides many secrets …",candidate00003
23,00015,unknown,"The creature's fangs glistened in the artificial light, flashing as it lunged. Nathan narrowly ducked aside, barely conscious of the action. Slavering phlegm splashed his arm, though, and he gagged faintly as its foetid breath drifted in its wake. Had he been less overwhelmed, or had its acidity been stronger, he may have felt the burning on his arm, but the immediate fear dominated his thoughts, and he wouldn’t notice the scars till later. What attention his body did pay to pain focused on where the beast had slashed, almost gouged, his chest, a fatal wound had he reacted an instant slower. He scrambled away, keeping it in view, but trying to find a clear path to the entrance. Stumbling over one of its victims, he fell against the wall, catching himself before he went down completely. He started to regain his feet, but stopped in a crouch as its head spun, freezing him briefly in its gaze. Steeling himself, he started to move slowly, but the creature emitted a low growl which forced him to reconsider, and he shifted his weight back against the wall. The abomination was like nothing he'd ever heard of, ever imagined. Its features appeared vaguely lupine, more like a dog than a wolf, but it loomed larger than a lion, its features hideously warped, mutated. Its body bulged unnaturally in places, the flesh giving off the occasional, horrific, bubbling movement, as new bones searched for a comfortable position. Its eyes held no trace of white, only a blood red almost hypnotic in its intensity. Despair began to take hold as he realised that even if he got to the entrance, he had little chance of outrunning it. The doors to this burial chamber had taken a handful of men to open, so no way could he move one alone, certainly not in the, at most, seconds before the creature caught him. From the screams which had recently echoed through the tunnels, it couldn't be alone, but Nathan had no way of telling where the rest of the pack was. The structure was a virtual labyrinth of corridors connecting numerous chambers, and he couldn’t be certain he could find his way out quickly. Not that outside would necessarily offer sanctuary. The vehicles were a short distance from the entrance, and there was no way he'd outmanoeuvre the creature in the open. Too many factors seemed arrayed against him. As his mind flailed hopelessly for an escape, he saw the creature tense, and did likewise in preparation. Then its gaze darted to the entrance, its stance shifting to match, and Nathan became aware of movement there. Risking a glance, he saw a man standing in the middle of the doorway, a sawn-off double barrelled shotgun aimed casually at the creature. With short cut dark hair, and stubble streaked with grey, his vaguely military clothing showed splashes of dark mud out of place in the desert setting. Nathan didn’t recognise him as a member of their group, and he hadn’t thought anyone else had been nearby. As his gaze returned to the creature, Nathan offered the stranger a warning, surprising himself with his voice's calmness. “They tried shooting it earlier, but didn’t slow it down. It must be adrenalin keeping it going. You might be able to knock it down a few seconds, and we could try to get the door shut on it…” “This’ll stop it,” said the stranger, not taking his steely eyes off his prey. The creature seemed to take this as a challenge, and launched itself at the new target. The shotgun exploded, jarring it out of its flight, and sent it twisting to the floor. The thing lay unmoving, and after a few seconds Nathan dragged his gaze from its disturbing, broken mass, to regard the stranger. The man, reloading, returned the appraising stare, his gaze loitering a moment over the slash on Nathan’s chest, before his deep set, wary eyes fixed Nathan’s. After a moment, Nathan's senses began to return, and he moved towards the stranger. “Thanks. How did you…” “Later. Come on.” The man turned and walked out the door. Nathan scrambled to follow, avoiding the bodies and not letting his eyes linger on them. The stranger waited outside the doorway, looking cautiously down the corridors leading from the room. His nerves on edge, Nathan started to introduce himself, to be cut off with a curt glare. “Quiet ‘til I say we’re clear,” said the stranger, his voice focused and steely. Nathan nodded and followed his saviour along the left-hand corridor. They stopped at irregular intervals, listening attentively, although Nathan could hear little over his own thunderous heartbeat. After long, tense, minutes, the man stopped short of a corner, standing with his back against the far wall, and set his shotgun. Nathan moved against the wall behind him, far enough back as to not crowd him. The seconds stretched agonizingly, as absolute silence enveloped them, even deafening his heartbeats, only to be shattered when another creature burst around the corner with an unearthly shriek. The stranger's gun responded with its own roar, slamming the thing back into the wall a split-second later. The stranger started a slow lope around the corner, and Nathan hurried to keep up. He didn’t stop to listen, as at least two more creatures howled elsewhere in the complex. Whether ahead or behind, he couldn't tell. The stranger didn’t break stride as another emerged from a side passage up ahead. Visible only in silhouette from a lamp further along, its unnatural proportions were unmistakable. The creature charged, its shriek drawing replies. It got within ten feet of them before it, too, fell to the stranger, who leapt its lifeless body, again without breaking stride, forcing Nathan to keep up. They drew to a halt at the side passage from which the beast had emerged. Reloading the gun, the stranger seemed to consider his course, before setting off down a passage. Slowing as they neared the next intersection, the stranger came to a stop a short distance before, eyeing the side passages. Silence reigned for a long moment, before a slight scratching came from one of the passageways. The stranger stepped back, Nathan trying to quietly back out of his way. Finding a comfortable position, he again set his shotgun. The creature burst from the passageway, but avoided the worst of the shotgun’s blast by diving down the opposite passage. Pellets caught its rear, however, eliciting an unnatural chilling screech of agony, and shot back into the corridor almost immediately, heading for its tormentor. A second blast from the shotgun ended its agony, but a sound from the corridor behind them broke the silence of its fall. Nathan turned to see another one bounding towards them. The stranger moved past him, discarding the shotgun he wouldn’t have time to reload, and drew a dully gleaming sword from beneath his pack. He set himself in the middle of the corridor as the creature barrelled towards them, only darting aside as the beast leapt, cleaving the sword through the its throat. The sword didn’t quite make it through, wrenched from his hand by the weight of the, now lifeless, monstrosity. Drawing a pistol, he searched for further threats. Satisfied no such dangers seemed near, the stranger re-holstered his pistol, retrieving the shotgun and calmly reloading. Done, he placed it near the corpse of the beast with his sword. Fixing his boot carefully on an unbloodied patch, he yanked the blade free, a sad spurt of lumpy, blackened gunk, vainly clinging to the weapon. Removing a cloth from his pack, he proceeded to wipe away the unnatural mess. “Marcus Carter,” said the man, not glancing up from his work. His voice remained gruff, but without the earlier tension. His words jolted Nathan from the state of shock he hadn’t even realised he’d slipped into. “Sorry?” He blinked his incomprehension. “My name is Marcus Carter.” Nathan stared for a moment before the words sank in. “Nathan Cornell. Pleased to meet you.” He’d been about to reflexively offer his hand, but thought better of it. “I didn’t know there was anyone else in the area. We were expecting to be fairly isolated.” “You probably were. I came for them.” He nodded at the creatures. “You hunt them?” Nathan realised his tone held more incredulity than he’d intended, but Marcus didn’t seemed to take note. “Yes.” He didn’t seem inclined to expand. “What did you shoot them with? Our bullets didn’t have much effect.” “Silver. Like this.” He inclined the tip of the sword towards Nathan, as he turned it round to carefully inspect his work. Satisfied, he slid it into its scabbard, tossing the cloth atop of the beast. The sword’s hold on his gaze broken, Nathan blinked in confusion. “Silver? What are they, werewolves?” Marcus didn’t bother looking around. “Doubt it, though I’ve never met any werewolves.” Picking up the shotgun, he moved along the corridor, his posture easier than before, but the set of his head betraying a casual wariness. Nathan followed, his nerves keeping his voice to a whisper. “So what are they then?” “I doubt there’s a proper, scientific, name for them. Most people don’t survive seeing their kind.” “Are there many of them?” “They crop up from time to time.” He glanced at the walls, his tone distracted. “You’re not going to give me a full answer are you?” “Maybe later.” Returning his attention to the corridor, Marcus moved on. Nathan followed quietly, as Marcus, seeming to have a destination, led them to the central burial chamber. Nathan blanched at the sight of the bodies there. He just about recognised what remained of Professor Taylor, discarded against one of the walls, and forced himself to look at the other faces, some of which were barely recognizable as human, with distinguishable marks erased. He didn’t find the one he dreaded seeing. “Who is it?” Marcus didn’t turn from his examination of the burial statuary arranged on top of a nearby dais. “Who’s who?” said Nathan, staring dumbly. Turning to face him, Marcus' hard eyes finally evinced a sliver of sympathy. “Whose body is it you’re looking for?” Nathan held his gaze a moment. “Annabel. My cousin. I don’t know where she’d have been when they attacked, but she isn’t…” His eyes made an ill-advised sweep of the chamber. “She isn’t among the bodies here, so I suppose there’s a chance…” He let the thought drift, looking hopefully at Marcus. “I doubt it,” said Marcus, his tone softer, but final. ""How many of you were there?"" ""Twenty-six,"" said Nathan, numbly. Marcus turned back to his work. “I'll check when I deal with the bodies, but… you were the only one I found alive, and it's luck I got to you in time. I’m sorry.” Nathan stood staring at his back. If they hadn't found her body, then there must still be a chance she could have survived, mustn't there. Nathan shook his head, trying to convince himself. “Maybe…” “No.” Marcus met his gaze, his eyes holding an unflinching certainty Nathan couldn’t avoid. Leaning against the nearest wall, the ache from his chest reminded him of the wound he needed to tend. But as the numbing shock returned, he couldn’t focus his mind on what to do. Marcus moved a couple of the small, primitive statues, and Nathan felt a slight, involuntary, relaxing of his body, as though a weight had been lifted. He caught Marcus' curious glance at his reaction. After a moment, the man resumed his task. “You felt that?” “Yes,” said Nathan. “What was it?” Lifting the statues from the dais with care, Marcus placed them precisely on the floor. “Shutting the tear the infection came through.” Calmly taking up his shotgun, he aimed at the statues, firing twice, destroying both. Nathan, caught off-guard, flinched back from the shards. When it seemed safe he risked a look, and found Marcus examining the walls. “What tear? What infection? You mean those non-werewolves?” “I mean the thing that changed them from regular stray dogs, or whatever they were, into those abominations. This place was built around a weak point between dimensions, a tear in the fabric separating realities. Sometimes things get through into this reality. Usually they don’t have anything we’d recognise as a physical body, so they need to latch onto one already here, to be able to enter this world.” He shot a reluctant glare at Nathan, who'd been about to ask a question. “Don’t ask me too much. I don’t really understand most of it myself. I’m just passing along what I was told.” “Told by whom?” Nathan couldn’t help himself. Marcus continued his survey, his voice growing detached as he concentrated. “Old African shaman called Dzivaguru. Not a witch, though. She didn’t like that. She met me soon after I stumbled into this… stuff, and tried to explain to me how these things work, and how to fight the infections. But she wasn’t an especially good teacher, and I’m not especially good at being taught. Apart from the fighting bits.” “And where is she now?” “Dead. Some cultist freaks, who apparently want these things coming here, killed her. We’ve clashes a few times since, but I still don’t know much about them.” “What did the decorations have to do with it? How could you close this tear just by moving them?” “That’ll be part of the ‘don’t know’ stuff. Apparently some of the old shamans, witch doctors, or whatever they were called by their particular culture, knew something about these other dimensions, but didn’t consider them hostile. Some believed they held a happy afterlife, and that souls buried on the tears would have an easier transition, so they’d build these big tombs for the rich on top of the sites. Other areas had similar ‘incursions’ to what we’ve experienced, so they became bad areas, to be avoided. Some knew secrets to sealing these gateways. Through some mumbo-jumbo or other they’d set something, usually some loose decorations, which could be set to hold the gate open or closed, as needed. They’re usually left closed.” “So was this? Did we open it, or was it already open? And if some are permanently open why hasn't it been noticed before?” Marcus shrugged, not turning. “They’re not constantly coming through every portal.” Nathan stared at the remnants on the floor, his mind grasping for anything to avoid recent events. “So it’s some kind of non-localised phenomena linked to the placement of the… switches I suppose we could call them.” Completing his inspection of the room, Marcus turned to Nathan. “You a student or something?” His tone gained focus he ran his eyes appraisingly over Nathan. “No.” Nathan resisted moving under the inspection. “Not for a couple of years, anyway.” “What'd you study?” “Stuff.” “Stuff, huh.” He offered a sceptical glance. “And this stuff brought you here?” “My cousin, Annabel, got me the job.” Bringing her to mind, he looked at the doorway, considering searching for her. Or what remained of her, if Marcus had been right. “The expedition had been organised by one of her teachers, I didn’t have a job, and they had trouble getting local help for the donkey work.” “Why. Don’t pay well?” Nathan nodded. “Limited budget. The Tunguska Group funding it seems a bit tight. Plus, of the few expeditions in the area, we’re about the only one without a film crew.” He peeled the remains of his shirt from the wound, wincing as parts dug in by the claws came free. “You have a first aid kit?” Marcus studied the wound. “There’s some outside, in the camp.” “We’d better have a look at patching you up, before I clean up here.” Collecting his stuff, Marcus moved towards the door. Nathan turned after him, but made no immediate move to follow. “I need to find Annabel.” His voice lowered, cracking slightly as he added, “even if it’s just her body.” Marcus nodded. “There were some bodies out by the camp. If she isn’t among those, we can have a look in here when you’re patched up.” Nodding, Nathan numbly followed, his body aching now adrenaline no longer suppressed his pain. His mind grasped for a distraction. “You mentioned closing the gate?” Marcus didn't slow or turn as he replied. “Manipulating the objects in a certain way closes the gateway, or stops anything coming through, anyway, but moving them wrong or just destroying them can leave the gate permanently accessible. As the old ways get forgotten this happened in places, so there are some permanent hotspots, fortunately it's been rare for anything to come through them. Until recently.” “What happened to change it?” “Don’t know.” They walked in silence a while, before Nathan spoke again. “And you really believe all this?” Marcus shrugged. “Doesn’t matter. I sense when the entities pass through from their dimensions, travel to their locations, and eliminate them before they spread.” Nathan looked dubiously at Marcus' back. “You ‘sense’ them?” “Yes.” His tone became more defensive, uncomfortable with the subject. “I can sense the life around me, and I can usually tell if any of it has been… infected,” he seemed to use the word grudgingly, “by creatures from outside this dimension, anywhere in the world.” “How… Where did you…” Nathan groped for a question, before being abruptly cut off. “I don’t know where the ability came from. It began a couple of years ago, before my first encounter with this otherworldly stuff. I mostly ignored it, and it wasn’t overwhelming so I managed to convince myself I’d taken too many hits to the head. But after learning about this stuff, I… accepted it, I suppose.” His tone became harsher, more aggressive. ""Why all the questions?"" Nathan considered this a moment. ""Shock, maybe. Perhaps it just distracts my mind from things I'm not ready to accept."" He hesitated a moment. ""You said you can sense life around you?"" Marcus sighed. ""It's not precise, but I can detect if there's something in the general area."" ""And you can't sense any life around us?"" ""Nothing human. Or infected."" ""So when you said that Annabel is probably…"" ""If she was still in the camp, then no, I'm afraid not."" Nathan, numbness and dread engulfing him as they neared the entrance, went quiet. As soon as they emerged from the structure, Nathan saw the slaughter at the camp, and numbly followed Marcus towards it, the smell drifting to meet them. He soon found what remained of Annabel, and kept his eyes focussed on her untouched head, aware of the state of the rest of her body, but unwilling to acknowledge it. Marcus, having located the medical pack, led him unresisting from the scene, sitting him on the opposite side of a truck from the carnage. Nathan paid little attention to Marcus' investigation of the wound, even when the man started talking. “There’re bits of cloth stuck in the wound. I’ll have to clean them out, and it’s probably best if I give you an anaesthetic first, okay?” A vague, automatic, nod was Nathan's only response, and he remained staring blankly ahead until he felt the needle. This focused his attention for a moment, but as he looked up in surprise at Marcus, the sedative began to take effect and he had the vague awareness of his head being lowered gently to the ground.",candidate00002
