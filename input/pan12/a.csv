0,00001,candidate00001,"Victor Dolor went to the diner because two months ago a man killed five people there. The man was Hugo Herrera. He was forty-one, divorced, recently unemployed from a downsized-factory job, and had finally been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder from something that happened when he was a child. Victor scanned several online articles for more specifics about the childhood trauma but found nothing. In response to Hugo's most recent therapy session with some high- priced psychologist, Hugo wrote a letter to The New York Times that said he was ""sick of all the fucking shit and finally going to do something about all the worthless shits in the world."" The Times did not print the letter. Two days after he mailed it, Hugo took his hunting rifle into the Alexis Diner just outside of Stone Creek, New York, and murdered five people. It was a sign. There had been many signs recently but the Hugo Herrera murders was the most significant. Everything was changing. The period of acqui- escent apathy was over. The time of now was the dawning of the age of the great cleansing when humanity would rid itself of the living detritus, shed the human excrement clogging the world, and give birth to a new golden age of empowered living. Victor had been chosen. He was a cleanser. Hugo had been a cleanser. Unlike Hugo, however, Victor was not about to kill in one grotesque orgy and then blow his own face off. Victor would help cleanse human- ity but he would do it so he too could one day enjoy the fruits of his labor. The next world would be his. He had also gone to the diner for the girl. She was in a booth with her father off to the left. Victor did not let his glance linger over her smooth flesh or soft red hair. She did not look up. Victor sat at the counter on a plush red stool. A young Mexican boy slid a place setting in front of him and produced a glass of ice water. Victor stared at it. In the journey to preserve the status quo, to stave off the inevitable shifting landscape of the cosmos and humanity, the powers that be kept the water supply bloated with mind-numbing drugs. People who drank from this endless reservoir of placation would be blind to the ensuing changes. They would be ignorant of all the signs the universe offered. The warnings. Condensation trickled down the side of the glass like tears. Or clear- colored blood. The swinging door to the kitchen opened and a middle-age woman in a black and turquoise uniform smiled at him. Deep wrinkles creased her face like the cracks in dried mud. ""Morning,"" she said to Victor. ""Coffee?"" He smiled right back, nodded. When she set down the glass he asked her about Hugo Herrera. He ex- pected her face to pale rapidly, her meaty hands to grab at the counter and her throat to make some kind of choking, gasping noise that was really a cry for help. Instead, she shrugged and said she hadn't been working that day, but it was a horrible, horrible tragedy. Victor slowly turned his coffee cup in a circle. It made the faintest scraping noise against the counter, almost like the sounds the mice in his basement made at night. ""Any idea why he did it?"" Victor sounded so calm, so damn normal, so average-Joe. The waitress paused. ""Everyone has a breaking point, I guess. Sounds to me like he just snapped. Or he was crazy."" ""No doubt,"" Victor said. The aroma of fried sausage swarmed around him like poison gas. ""But why here? Was he a regular?"" ""I never heard of him until that day when Arlon, my boss, called and said some wackjob shot up the place. Killed five people, one of them was a waitress."" ""You know her?"" ""Sabrina? She was a new girl. Just out of high school, looking to save up for community college. She was a pretty thing. Such a shame."" Victor glanced around, merely for show. The diner was fairly busy this Saturday morning. People were engaged in conversations in the booths while scraping their forks across plates that must have been used a bil- lion times. The only other patron at the counter, however, was an old man in a big, heavy coat. He was at the far end, a cup of coffee before him and a newspaper. ""Place seems to have bounced right back,"" Victor said. ""Like it did after the last time."" The waitress nodded. ""I didn't know what to expect. Thought I'd be out of a job. But Arlon reopened after three days, when the cops were done, of course, and people came back. Helps to be the only diner in a twenty-mile radius."" ""I'm sure."" Victor had lived in Stone Creek his whole life. The little town was squished on the corner of Orange County, New York, at the foot of Blood Mountain. The mountain was the second highest peak in the region next to Schunemunk Mountain, which, at almost seventeen- hundred-feet high, always got all the attention. Blood Mountain, however, had that killer name and the beauty that went with it. ""What did you mean, the last time?"" the waitress asked. ""Some places are marked,"" he said. ""Marked?"" ""Cursed, I guess you'd say, but it's more than that."" ""Uh-huh,"" she said. ""What can I get you?"" ""The coffee is fine for now, thanks."" ""You just let me know."" She winked. Victor smiled back. What would she look like beneath his hunting knife? Would she still wink at him when he pushed it slowly into that soft spot at the base of her throat where her skin had started to sag? She walked down to the old guy at the end of the counter and then made her way to the front of the diner where the rest of her customers waited in booths. Victor spun slowly on the stool as if he were maneuv- ering to get up, maybe head to the bathroom. The girl and her father had only coffee and water so far. But they would soon be eating quite a large breakfast. They wanted to have enough energy to make it to a late lunch if not dinner. They would have eggs and bacon and pancakes and toast and hash browns. They would eat up because they thought it would help them. He would watch them eat for a little while. Watch the way the girl, not a girl but a young woman, chewed her food. The way her jaw moved. The way her lips pursed open just slightly like offering some secret kiss. He would watch and then he would go back to his car and eat the tuna fish sandwich waiting there. He would leave five dollars on the counter and a full cup of coffee Mercy Higgins did not want to climb some ugly mountain with her fath- er when she could be at home reading a book or working on one of her short stories. Could be at the bookstore helping Pete clean out the fiction section for the new coffee bar he was installing. Dad needed this, however, and that would have to suffice. The book someone had given him at work ""Daddy/Daughter Bond- ing: Activities to strengthen a Father's Connection with his Daughter"" waited before him like it was his meal. Several skinny Post- Its stuck out from the pages. ""I know you don't want to do this,"" Dad said. She started to protest but he continued. ""I know this may not be what you want to do on a Saturday, but I think it'll be good for us. Get some fresh air. Some dis- tance from the world. You might actually have fun."" They had never been camping. Dad never showed any interest and she certainly had no desire to sleep in a tent on the ground. Not to mention the hiking. They weren't prissy people; they just liked their quiet time at home. It was warm there, especially in the reading room where Dad kept the fireplace going through the winter and the walls of books sheltered her like giant arms. Mom had loved that room, too. ""It's fine, Dad,"" she said. ""I'm looking forward to it."" She held his gaze long enough for him to believe it, or at least add it to the tomb of self- denial he was perpetually building. ""It's supposed to be beautiful tonight. Maybe a little chilly but we've got the thermal sleeping bags and the arctic tent. The portable grill, too. Hopefully, I'll be able to get a fire going."" He laughed in that way that al- ways made him sound vulnerable. It was something she liked about her dad, something she'd liked about Joel at school, too. So many men came across as cocky know-it-alls; it was refreshing to find a few who could be self-deprecating. ""I know, Dad."" ""I bought the best stuff. It's not like we're heading out unprepared."" ""I know."" ""It's going to be fun. Trust me."" About a month before she died, Mom told Mercy all the things she loved about her husband. She said them slowly, breathing shallowly between words. When Mom started on the physical traits, Mercy had steeled herself against the expectation of graphic sexual references be- cause sometimes in those last days Mom had forgotten what she was saying, gotten really vulgar. Instead, Mom said it was Dad's smile that always moved her heart. So sweet and inviting. And those dimples. Dad's smile now was no less sweet but carried a weight of despera- tion. The beard he'd grown had covered his dimples and his face had thinned. ""You're really sweet, Dad."" ""No pity on your old man. This is for us."" When the waitress took their order, they both asked for more food than they had intended, like they knew they would need it. Beyond the parking lot outside the window was Route 51, which led straight across the county to New Jersey in the west and onward to New York City in the east, and on the other side of the road, almost close enough to touch, waited the foot of Blood Mountain. Clouds obscured the peak like it was something secretive. Or dangerous. Victor did use the bathroom before he left the diner. It was a cramped, two-person room with one stall and a urinal. When he relieved himself, Victor admired his penis. He stretched it out. From what he found on the Internet, it was above-average in length. When he had paid a woman to suck him off, she made no comment about his size. He almost asked but he didn't want her to look at him with that skeletal face and gap-tooth smirk. ""Soon enough,"" he murmured to it. He put himself carefully away in his pants before he could get excited and washed his hands at the sink. Too many images crowded his mind. So many ways he could manipulate the female body. So many positions. He had to keep those images in check. If he let his excitement get control, he would lose the upper hand. He had planned this for far too long to let it get away because he was desperate for a woman's touch. After the cleansing, there would be plenty of women for men like him. Plenty of touching. Mercy Higgins could be saved. It would be her choice. Victor almost missed the writing on the mirror. He started to turn away, shaking his hands dry, and wondering if using their water had been such a good idea; it might permeate his skin, infect him. In the lower right corner, scratched into the mirror's surface, it said: Cleanse the World. Victor traced the three words with his finger. The indentations they made in the mirror were like slices in skin, knife tracks about to spout blood. It didn't matter who put it there, Hugo or someone before him. It was another sign. Victor left the bathroom. His smile must have looked so peculiar. While Mercy and her father gobbled eggs and pancakes and toast, the teens in the booth across from them discussed the recent shooting in which a crazy guy named Hugo killed five people in this very diner. ""Fucking guy came in with a shotgun or some shit and bam! bam! bam!"" The teenage boy in the skinny jeans and body-tight hoodie made a child-like gun gesture with his thumb and forefinger. His equally tight-dressed friend laughed like the kid was talking about some movie. The first kid glanced around, like scoping out the place. ""Can you ima- gine? Must of been sick to see it go down. Blood hitting the walls and shit."" ""You're sick, man,"" his friend said. The first boy glanced at Mercy and her father. His gaze lingered briefly. What was he seeing in his head? Was he imagining fucking her in some degrading way? ""Can't be prude about it,"" he said to his friend. ""Most people live in a bubble."" That's what Joel had said: Mercy, you live in a bubble. And he'd told her to use fabric softener. Such a weird thing to say. You're clothes al- ways smell stale. So, she'd used dryer sheets and went around in a cloud of lemon. Then he'd told her she had clammy hands and that he'd found someone else. She tried to elicit a smile from him but he stared at her like she was some beggar on the street. In a way she had been. She'd begged to have sex with him, told him she was a virgin and that she really wanted him, even though she wasn't sure that was the case but she was almost out of college and nobody graduated college still a virgin. Only losers. Then he said her hands were clammy and he'd met someone else. ""Can you imagine how fucked up it must have been?"" the first boy asked. ""I'm glad I wasn't here,"" his friend said. ""Fuck that. I would have taken that guy down. Would have shot him between his eyes. Watch the blood splatter. Been a hero."" Mercy's eyes started to water. A minute ago she had been fine. Her only feeling was one of slight dread about hiking up a mountain on a chilly spring day and then having to sleep on the ground at some camp- site. Then those two boys started talking about the killing and she was remembering Joel for some reason and how he said she smelled stale and had clammy hands and wouldn't have sex with her and then she had graduated a virgin. Now, she was crying. Sometimes she hated being a woman. Her father put down his fork and touched her arm. ""Honey, what's wrong?"" She took several napkins out of the dispenser on the table and dried her eyes. When she looked at her father, he had that sweet face he al- ways got when things didn't turn out right for her. When she'd fallen off her bike as a little kid. When her violin audition for Juilliard fell through and she studied literature at the State University in Pleasantville instead. When Mom died. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""You have nothing to be sorry about. This is my fault. I shouldn't have pushed this whole camping thing on you. I just thought it would be fun. Thought we could have some time to bond."" Tears began to reemerge. ""It's not that. I want to go camping. It's just ... Just ... "" She paused, breathed deeply. ""I have to use the bathroom."" When she slid out of the booth, the first boy said, ""You think the guy wanted to have sex with any of the bodies? Shoot his load and then shoot his head off."" If Mercy were a different sort of woman, she would tell them to stop being such stupid pricks and grow up and then she'd throw a cup of cof- fee on each of them. She started to get her tears under control. A skinny guy with several- day's worth of stubble on his face was staring at her. He was walking past the counter while she was on the opposite side of a dividing row of booths. He wore jeans and a black jacket. He was cute, too, aside from an undernourished face. She knew him from somewhere. Their eyes met and the man looked away. A moment later he was at the front door and Mercy was in the bathroom. She knew him. She had spoken with him. Victor held the girl's gaze for no more than a second or two. He would have loved to stare at her for hours. Loved to hold her close and stare in- to her eyes, caress the fragility of her soul. There would be time for that later. If she caught on too soon, there was a risk the whole thing might collapse. He had pressed his luck, no doubt about that, and if he pressed it any further he would be, as his father used to say, S.O.L. No dinner tonight, son. Sorry. But I'm hungry. S.O.L. Shit out of luck. Victor's father hadn't been a bad man or even a bad father. He was the kind of father who never understood what fatherhood was really about. He saw Victor as a roommate, maybe even an acquaintance. He didn't belief in tender consolation. Life dealt you a bad hand? Well, looks like you're S.O.L. Victor didn't want to be S.O.L. Luck had been with him for a while now. It would continue to be with him. He only had to trust the greater powers manipulating his future. He turned from the girl's soft white skin and innocent blue eyes. They would be his in time. Then he could chew on that flesh and suck those eyes right from her skull if he wanted. Maybe she'd even like that, get off on it. Her body would convulse in a spasmodic orgasm as her eye slid past his lips and onto his tongue. He walked quickly outside to his car. The friction of his jeans only en- couraged his arousal. His underwear, always a size too small on pur- pose, was doing little to stymie the growing bulge. He had parked at the far end of the parking lot. His car was a beater from the late eighties he had bought for one-hundred dollars. It had two- hundred-eighty thousand miles. The steering wheel shook violently at speeds over forty and the exhaust stank of rotting eggs. But it was all he needed. There were no cars near his. He dropped into the drivers' seat. It groaned like it might finally give out. He yanked down his jeans and took his cell phone from his jacket. He caressed himself faster and faster as he scrolled through the fifty pic- tures he had taken of Mercy Higgins. He managed to get the box of tissues out of the glove compartment in time. Mercy almost started crying harder when she thought how much easier it would be to explain everything to Mom. Women understood how messed up they were. They knew their bodies were uncontrollable ves- sels of perpetually battling hormones. A woman could be giddy with happiness one minute and completely devastated at the crippling power of some perceived fear the next. She could not explain everything to Dad. She couldn't tell him how she felt about Mom, about her despera- tion to have sex with Joel, her overwhelming feeling of failure about her music and her fear that her life was a pointless string of disappoint- ments. Mom would have understood, let her voice her shopping list of worries and then shared a secret smoke with her and told her that life for a woman was much harder than a man could ever realize. Dad would blame himself because he was sensitive and then she'd feel even worse. She almost surrendered. She almost told Dad that she wasn't feeling well and that she'd rather just go home and curl up in bed with a book. Spend tomorrow at the bookstore helping Pete. The bookstore. Where she had seen that guy. Since high school, Mercy worked a few days a week at a local book- store called Rune Books. Pete Harwinski started the place in the eighties and managed to keep it profitable through all the publishing scares. He created an online presence to make his place known for the people who prided themselves on shopping only at privately owned shops. He'd re- cently added free Wi-Fi and was building a coffee bar with a few plush chairs for costumers who didn't want to buy books but liked scrolling the Internet in such ambiance. Since graduating, Mercy worked there six days a week. She'd probably end up serving coffee by the end of next week. Not very impressive for someone with a Bachelor's in Literary Theory with a minor in English Literature. The store was never very busy except around Christmas, but Pete made enough to keep the business going and pay Mercy twelve dollars an hour. She lived at home and didn't really care about the money. She worked there because Pete was such a nice guy, a second father, really, and because she'd always loved books. She could sit in the store, breath- ing in the sweet intermingling aromas of new and old books and read all day long. The small size of the store and the way the towering shelves of books obscured what dim lighting there was always intimidated newcomers. Most newbies wanted the latest bestseller from whoever, but some were on a mission to get a rare hardback copy of some novel published in the sixties or seventies. Maybe two-dozen regulars frequented the store every few days or so on what seemed like a rotating schedule. Most were nice, some weird. She knew all their names, too, all except for the guy she had just seen in the diner. She should have recognized him immediately. He usually came into the store every three or four days an hour or so before closing. He never returned her hellos. He went right to the far end of the store, opposite the cashier counter. He never seemed to find anything to buy. Pete called him ""the perpetual browser."" Mercy was reorganizing a shelf of horror paperbacks from the eighties with their flashy covers of gory monsters and blood-soaked landscapes when he caught the man peering around the corner of the bookcase at her. She asked if she could help him. His eyes did some kind of weird jiggle or something and he said no. A moment later, he was running out of the store like he had forgotten some urgent appointment. That had been a month ago. Since then, he had been in the store but al- ways like a ghost, hidden from view, only felt as some kind of different presence. Not threatening, exactly, but certainly strange. He probably wanted to ask her out. Perish the thought. Victor cleaned himself up and stuffed the towel back into the glove com- partment. Free of that stuff, his body was calm, his mind focused. When he didn't relieve himself for a while, he could get a little crazy. He accep- ted that. The pleasure he gave himself was part of his maintenance, like brushing his teeth or bathing. With a clear mind, he could see the situation better. See the pitfalls. The danger. He had been stupid to enter the diner. Stupider still to stare at the girl and, stupidest of all, to make eye contact. It wouldn't take long for her to place who he was. Not that she knew anything about him, but he hadn't exactly been as covert as the situation required. The girl might get freaked, call off the camping expedition. She'd told her friend over the phone that her father thought the night on the moun- tain would be some kind of bonding thing but she would much rather see a therapist together. The girl had laughed at something her friend said before saying that maybe it wouldn't be so bad, maybe they would run into a cute hiker. Victor had been near the back of the bookstore where she worked, on his knees, pretending to scan the bindings of old hardcover books. The girl's voice echoed through the store and teased him with its sensuality like those mythological creatures and their songs that lured sailers to their death. The girl was no beast. She was an innocent, perhaps marked for death as the old world gave way to the New Time, but he would give her a chance to save herself. At least for a while. It was the how of this situation he had never fully calculated. He couldn't simply speak to her. She would see the truth of his nature, dis- cover he was a cleanser, and rebuke him. Then he would have to kill her. For now, he would stay out of the way. Trail them up the mountain. Hide in the distance. Wait for his opportunity. Like when the rats came out. He could spend hours waiting in the dark of his basement. His hearing would get fuzzy and then adjust to the silence. His eyes would find the outline of the furniture and then gradually reveal their hidden dimensions. If he waited long enough, his senses grew super keen. Then the rats had no chance. Sometimes he killed them outright. Other times he amputated their legs and then gradually sliced open their bellies to see how long they would keep fighting to live. The struggle could last for some time. He would trust in his patience, in his senses, in his self-control. In the power the universe had given him. That was easy to do when his mind wasn't flooded with images of the girl on her knees before him, mouth wide. In those fantasies, her eyes were black holes that cried tears of blood. Like the tears the trees cried on the mountain. The girl and her father were at a table in one of the windows. The glare from the sun painted the girl in a holy aura like a giant halo. Two teenage boys were smoking on the opposite side of the front stairs. They were laughing about something. Victor got out of the car and opened his trunk. He checked his sup- plies. He hoped the rifle would not be necessary. He had never fired one. It was the same kind Hugo Herrera had used. He must have been quick, reloading and firing to kill five people without anyone stopping him. Too quick to almost be unbelievable. Why didn't anyone try to stop him? Because in those final minutes, everyone in that diner knew the bell of a special hour had rung. People spend lifetimes looking forward to things but when destiny catches up with them they are helpless. We are all helpless before the Great Plan. Victor caressed his backpack. The hunting knives were in there. Set of seven. Each sharpened and polished. Sometimes he stared at his reflec- tion in those blades and imagined blood traversing the grooves like open veins. He grinned. The teenage boys were gone. On the table, they left one dollar. Dad looked so sad and helpless that Mercy's tears almost returned full force. When he began to apologize and call off the camping expedition, Mercy shook her head like Mom used to and said she was sorry, that she wanted to go on this trip with him, she really did. ""It won't be as bad as you think,"" Dad said. ""It's not going to rain."" He was trying. She picked at the remainder of her meal. Outside, the two teenage boys were walking across the parking lot to- ward the far end. Their tight jeans with the sagging butts looked ridicu- lous. They probably didn't have a car. Maybe been up all night drinking, talking about sex. They were assholes, but boys had it easier. Living the bohemian way came naturally to them. Ratcheting up sexual escapades like they were collecting baseball cards. Virginity was a grease stain needing to be wiped clean. Joel had not pressured her. He had given her intense physical pleas- ure. The first time he went down on her she was appalled and horrified, afraid he would comment on her smell, but those worries vanished in a full-body tingling sensation. She was nervous returning the favor and had done her best imitation of what a porn woman would do. Even after a month of similar exchanges, he denied her the full pleasure of his sex because he had found someone new and he didn't want to take advant- age of her. How wonderfully noble of him. ""We can talk about anything,"" Dad said. ""I know I'm your father and that makes it weird sometimes, but I am here for you. I won't judge you."" He meant well but it made her feel even more like a little girl. She was supposed to be a woman, a college-educated woman, not some teen fret- ting over boy issues. ""I know,"" she said. ""I'm thinking about Mom."" Ironically, talking about Mom was a preferable discussion. Dad's face paled. ""It was hard. But you were so wonderful, honey. So strong."" ""It's fine, Dad."" ""No. I mean it. Without you, I would have fallen apart. My little girl saved me."" ""I was a mess."" ""You were so strong. There is a lot of your mother in you. I hope you know that."" ""Thanks, Dad."" Gradually, their solemn faces brightened until he made that stupid walrus face and she managed a giggle. Like when she had been young. The boys were almost at the far end of the parking lot where a small car with dark splotches of rust on its side waited, the trunk open. The guy from the bookstore was standing there, gesturing for them to ap- proach, like he had something really wonderful to show them. The boys came around the car on either side like jackals. All three stepped behind the open trunk lid. ""You don't have to keep things bottled,"" Dad said. ""I'm just looking at the mountain."" Dad appreciated the view for a moment. ""A little bare right now but in a few weeks the trees will be lush. By then, lots of people will be up there. The trails will be littered with wrappers and plastic bottles."" Going up Blood Mountain was a rite of passage for many people in Stone Creek. Parents took their kids up there as infants. Boys shot their first deers up there. Teenagers gathered to drink and have sex up there. Or so she heard. ""This time of year is why the mountain gets its name,"" Dad said. The boys moved behind the curtain of the trunk. A jagged rust scar marked it like a battle wound on a soldier's face. ""All the pine trees. They start excreting around now. Change in the temperature or something. Sap is deep red. Tourists come to see it. The Great Bleed, it's called."" Dad had been stumbling around the Internet again. In elementary school, kids said the mountain got its name from all the Indians that were slaughtered up there when the white settlers founded Stone Creek. In high school, the story had something to do with a hook- armed psychopath who liked to kidnap teenage girls up there. He'd rape them and hang them naked upside down from the trees. He would slice their throats with a hunting knife and watch them bleed out. Even a teacher once supported the story. ""Lesson is, girls,"" the teacher said, ""don't go camping."" ""The Great Bleed?"" she asked. She thought of the first time she got her period. Thankfully, Mom had still been very much alive. ""It's what they say."" ""Who?"" ""They."" ""Can't trust everything they say, Dad."" ""You're sure you want to do this?"" he asked like she were debating getting on a roller coaster she'd finally gotten tall enough to board. ""Yes, Dad."" Outside, one of the boys fell to his knees. ",candidate00001
1,00002,candidate00001,"She drove a silver PT Cruiser GT with a 2.4 liter turbocharged engine that could muster 220 horsepower at 5,100 rpm and featured an optional shifter so she could change gears or let the car do it for her. Stacy. That's what she named her PT Cruiser. It was her sister's name. I never felt comfortable in it, though. I claimed that the seats slanted forward, which they did, and that made me feel like I might topple out through the windshield onto the road, which it did, but that wasn't why I disliked the car I disliked it because whenever I sat in that passenger seat (she always drove), the leather gripped my clothes like tiny hands and my lungs collapsed as though a weight were resting on me, or hands pushing me against the seat. ""Another PT stress attack?"" Tara would ask with a smile. I tried to pass them off some weren't as bad as others and smile back at her, but the pressure would mount on my chest and sweat would bead on my forehead; I'd grip the arm rest on the door and squeeze it un- til my hand turned numb. A few times I nearly started screaming, but the lack of air in my lungs and my self-assurance that this was some completely irrational reaction, perhaps to some long-buried childhood trauma, limited my vocalizations to quiet groans. Even with the window down and air pummeling my face and shoot- ing up my nose, my breathing did not improve. It never did, until I got out of the car. Once I stepped free from the car, slamming the door be- hind me, my lungs filled up and the sweat evaporated. I never told her this, knowing she would laugh long and hard at me, perhaps even have tears rolling down her cheeks, but I think I never liked that car because Stacy died in it. Technically, she hadn't died in the car. Only a day after taking the car off the dealership's lot, my girlfriend picked up her sister and took her for a drive. They talked about their family, about me, too, I suppose, about how Stacy was going to college in a few short weeks and how much fun she would have drinking and meeting boys without mom and dad around to judge her every move, how she would actually have good friends, not ones who betrayed her because they envied her intelligence. Then Stacy had said her head hurt, really bad, and then she collapsed against the door, limp. Tara laughed at first, thinking Stacy had only been exaggerating her physical exhaustion from dealing with their parents, but that initial misread turned quickly into frantic pleas and vi- cious shaking. Tara never forgave herself for laughing at first. But I don't think it would have mattered if she had realized right away what had happened and sped to the hospital. The doctor said it had been an an- eurysm something popped in her brain; Stacy had died in the hospital. But moments before, she had been in the PT Cruiser, limp but breath- ing, in the passenger seat. Tara would have laughed if I had propounded a supernatural theory about my PT stress attacks because Stacy had been a lovely, kind hearted girl who had liked me well enough, and I had enjoyed her company as much as I could have someone half my age. But Stacy had often been ostracized from her peers as I said; so, I think my theory may have held some credibility. Some sisters are close; others are practically one. Only a few weeks later, it was no longer a theory. Walking to Tara's car, I saw Stacy in the passenger's seat sitting there, head forward, hair blocking her face. I closed my eyes and walked closer. When I looked again, her head had turned to me, face pale, eyes red and swollen. I stopped, suddenly cold. ""PT anxiety hitting already?"" Tara asked. Stacy opened her mouth wide, wider than any human mouth could open-her teeth had turned completely black; bloody gaps marked where teeth had rotted away. Her eyes bloated into large teardrop orbs and she screamed at me. The scream did not pierce the air or make my ears ring, but it did turn my legs to Jell-O and my skin into a million squirming insects. Tara laughed I must have looked like a little kid being pressured into riding the monster rollercoaster. ""You can't stay here,"" she said. ""Bob and Vicki don't have a spare bed."" I looked from Tara to the passenger seat. Stacy's open-mouthed howl had drained to a defeated, sagging frown even her eyes drooped. Her skin rippled, liquefied, and fell away like a gush of tears. Tara got in the car and started the engine. I opened the passenger door and hesitated. Did the seat look wet? Did the air smell damp like a coffin beneath mounds of water-logged soil? ""You look sick,"" Tara said. I nodded. I eased my head inside the car; it felt incredibly hot and I immediately started to sweat. Tara sighed heavily. ""Stacy wouldn't want to make you uncomfortable, or hurt you,"" she said. She caressed the dashboard as she did my stomach when she wanted to help me fall asleep. ""Besides, Stacy loves you, doesn't she?"" Did she mean the car or her dead sister? ""Maybe I should ride in the back,"" I said. ""What? That's stupid. I'm not a chauffeur."" She smiled. ""Stacy likes when you ride up front so do I."" I took a deep breath and got in the car. The leather gripped me more firmly and the hands pushed harder, driving me back into the seat. I shut the door and tried to pretend the puddle in between my feet was from my boots. I would tell Tara what I had seen when we got back to our place. Then I'd give her the ring, asking her to marry a man who be- lieved in ghosts. I never got the chance. Side supplemental air bags come standard on the PT Cruiser GT; they are supposed to cushion the driver's and passengers' heads in a collision. And, in all fairness, they did protect my head when a motorcyclist crashed into the driver's side door as Tara had been turning out of Bob and Vicki's driveway. The motorcyclist had been nearing 100 miles per hour, evading the po- lice, when he gunned the engine even more around a blind curve. Tara had been looking at me when the motorcycle hit, and for that I am grate- ful. I saw a glint of sun bounce off the bike and then I lay on my side, head resting on a deflating air bag. Tara had looked to her left and then right and then smiled at me as she pulled out. I smiled back (trying to ignore the pressure on my chest) and I wish I could say I told her I loved her, but I didn't. She knew that, though. Our love had been so strong, so consuming like a giant comfort- er that you could wrap around yourself many, many times until you felt completely warm and safe. The speed of the motorcycle combined with the Cruiser making a left turn flipped the car on its side. When I realized I was against the road, head on an inflatable safety pillow, I looked out the windshield for my girlfriend. Broken glass and scattered pieces of metal was that the motorcycle's tail pipe? lay strewn across the concrete. Warm liquid dripped on my face. I looked up. Tara was still buckled in her seat, but her door had caved in, crushing her side-I couldn't see her left arm or leg. Her head sagged toward me; blood dribbled from her green eyes. I screamed and everything went black. And in the darkness, Stacy's gaping mouth hollered at me and then quickly melted to sagging, quivering lips and watery eyes. I awoke in a hospital. Understanding. I had suffered a broken right arm, fracturing it against the arm rest that I had gripped during my panic attacks. Tara and the motorcyclist had been killed on impact. Her parents came to the hospital and we cried together. Her mother held me and we sobbed on each other's shoulders while her father sat in a folding chair and stared at the wall as though he were looking through it; tears fell steadily from his eyes. ""Both my babies,"" her mother cried against me. ""They're both gone."" I know and I'm sorry, I wanted to say, but such statements sound so stupid, so insignificant. ""I want them back,"" her mother said. ""I need them."" She kept crying, often uttering her daughters' names, but those words stayed with me, seeped into me and grabbed hold, tattooing me. I want them back. Two police officers arrived sometime later and asked for my account of the accident. I told them everything except how the blood dripped from Tara's eyes that image would be mine forever; regardless of the pain it caused, I would shoulder that image alone. ""If you think of anything else,"" the larger of the two officers said, ""please call the station and let us know."" I expected a business card, but small town cops don't have a need for such things. The smaller cop offered a slight smile, the kind you put on when the scene was tragically morose, but you were more or less indif- ferent. They started to turn away but I stopped them. The larger cop looked at me, eyebrow rising. ""The car, her car... "" The cops looked at each other as though this were a rhetorical question but perhaps this guy had been too shocked for it to register, maybe he didn't even realize his girlfriend had been killed, been nearly sliced in half, actually. ""Well,"" the bigger one said, ""it was totaled."" ""Yes, but... "" ""We got plenty of pictures,"" the smaller one said as though he were re- ferring to his family's trip to Busch Gardens. The bigger cop glanced at him and then turned to me. ""You'll get a copy of the report. Your insurance company can get a copy also; they can call me, too, if there's a problem."" ""I appreciate that,"" I said. ""But where is the car? Right now."" They looked at each other. The smaller cop flipped open a notebook. The car had been brought to Kane's Car Deposit, a modest junk pile of crushed cars and scattered car parts set on a section of dead grass on a back road just outside of the county. I made my way there via a blue and green taxi that stank of cigarette smoke; small holes with singed edges speckled the back seat. I told the cab driver to wait just in case the car wouldn't start. ""It's a junkyard,"" the man said. Dotted with splotches of ketchup, his white T- shirt stretched over a formidable gut. ""They don't bring cars here that can get here themselves."" I nodded, told him to wait, and walked inside a small garage that smelled of oil and flatulence. Throbs of pain pulsated in my arm every few seconds. I should have filled my prescription first. The office was small and cramped. Various bolts and screws lay on scattered yellowed papers on the reception desk like tiny paper weights. A rusted radiator sat in the only waiting chair, which had been torn in several places as though from an armed and angry customer. A glass partition separated the office from the garage; thick dirt streaked the glass in swirls. A large man in a faded green T-shirt sat in a smaller back room at a table eating a sandwich over tinfoil. A radio squawked a sports show of some kind from somewhere in the room. I looked for a bell to get the man's attention, but settled for knocking on the front of the desk. The man turned slowly, a piece of tomato hanging from his lips. ""Hello,"" I said. ""I'm looking for a car."" The man stood slowly, his knees needing to accept the considerable girth of the man's middle section before walking, and slurped the rest of the tomato into his mouth. He made his way to the desk with heavy feet. ""We got lots of cars,"" he said. He dropped a swollen hand onto the desk; it creaked beneath it. ""But most of 'em don't look like they used to."" He laughed. I chuckled with him briefly. ""I'm looking for a car that was brought in earlier today-a PT Cruiser."" The man nodded several times; wads of skin shook below his chin. ""I know just the one. Motorcycle crash. Totaled. Cops just dropped her off."" ""Could I see it?"" The man clicked his tongue in his mouth a few times. ""Why you want to do that?"" I raised my arm in its cast. ""'Cause I was in it during the crash."" The car had been dropped off inside the garage so that it could be stripped for any usable parts before being crushed. I have never known much about cars, what I know about Tara's PT Cruiser-the specks, anyway-I got from the Internet, so I didn't know exactly what totaled meant. The entire driver's side had been pushed inward, the metal ripping at the point of impact. It looked like a missile had hit it. In a way, I guess one had. The front had crumbled with the side and the roof had col- lapsed as well. Only the rear passenger tire hadn't gone flat-the front driver's tire was completely gone; a mangled disk of metal protruded from the wheel well like a disfigured fist. ""You think you left something in there?"" the man asked. ""Cause the cops said they cleaned the car out for personal stuff."" I looked at him. ""Can they do that?"" His face twitched. ""Think they were just being considerate."" ""Right,"" I said. ""Sorry."" I stepped to the crushed driver's side. I leaned forward and stopped just short of putting my head through the open window frame. Blood spatters stained the gear shift and both of the seats. I felt the warm liquid dripping on my temple. I touched my forehead and rubbed the sensation away. The aroma of Tara's body spray, a mix of vanilla and peaches, lingered inside the car like the wisps of memory that hang around the corners of your brain long after an event has passed. The door was ajar. The edge had been torn and bent. I touched it, ex- pecting it to be hot, maybe even scalding, but the metal was cool. It had just been a change for the metal that constructed the car as it had been a change for me-once whole, now mangled and irreparable. The man stood at the front of the car, hands joined on his enormous gut. ""Not much usable from the body,"" he said, ""but there's some parts inside: engine parts, some transmission... "" He continued with his list while I opened the driver's door; it creaked loudly, metal grinding against metal. ""Surprised they didn't use the jaws of life,"" the man said. ""Had they, you wouldn't have to open a door to get in; wouldn't be a door there at all."" Jaws of Life. An ironic term for something that would have been used to free the dead. I stepped forward and leaned inside the car. ""Surprised you only broke your arm,"" the man said. ""Accident like that... Luckily to be alive."" I looked at him through the windshield that was no longer there. ""Yes,"" I said. ""Lucky to be alive."" The smell of peaches and vanilla intens- ified as though she had just been here. ""Good thing you came right away cause we're probably gonna crush her and throw her in the graveyard tomorrow. Send the money to the rightful people, though."" ""Graveyard?"" I asked. He made a thumbs up sign and pointed over his shoulder, behind him. ""Out back. Where all the cars end up. You'd be surprised how many people come around wanting to scavenge through there."" I imagined this car flattened to a rectangle with damaged wheels. I saw all the people climbing on it and over it, either searching it for some desperately needed piece or using it as a rung on a ladder to get to a dif- ferent car corpse. The smell got stronger. I breathed deeply, closing my eyes. I felt Tara's hair touch my face as it so often did when we slept, my arms around her. ""Are you Kane?"" I asked. ""The owner?"" He laughed, belly vibrating. ""No. He's probably off somewhere count- ing all his money and seducing all kinds of women."" ""Didn't know the car crushing business was so glamorous."" ""Ain't the business; it's the man,"" he said. ""Just like with a car. The vehicle doesn't make you glamorous, you make you glamorous."" ""Interesting,"" I said. Had he gotten such insight from a roast beef sand- wich and sports talk radio? ""I'd like to take the car back,"" I said. The man looked at me as though I had said I wanted to rebuild it; hell, that's what he probably believed I meant. I glanced at the dried blood stains on the driver's seat, what was left of it anyway, and got inside Tara's PT Cruiser. The man walked around to the driver's side. ""You want to take it back? Home?"" I put my left hand on the part of the steering wheel that remained, gripping it as I had seen Tara grip it so many times, fondly, affection- ately. ""Yes,"" I said. ""That's exactly what I want to do."" ""But why?"" Was this such an uncommon occurrence? I supposed it probably was; who wanted a totaled car, especially the one in which their loved one had died? ""You believe in ghosts?"" I asked. He stared back at me. Blinked. I didn't think he would understand. I paid to have the car towed back to my house, the house I had shared with Tara for three years. I left my car in the driveway and had the PT Cruiser put in the garage. I didn't want people seeing the wrecked vehicle, thinking I was holding onto it because I couldn't let go of Tara. And I didn't want them to watch me. I sat in the car for a few hours the first time. I touched the steering wheel as I had at the car dump. I inhaled deeply; the smell of Tara's spray faint at first as though the tow over here had destroyed it, but then it came back stronger and stronger. I could have gotten her spray from inside and made it even more so, but that would have been fake; that would have been covering reality. Something pushed on my chest, forcing the air out of my lungs. Sweat popped along my arms, the skin beneath my cast itching furiously. I tried to breathe, but the pressure intensified; the invisible hands pushed harder. I felt my face turn red, straining for oxygen, for the pressure to be re- leased. Tears rolled out of my eyes. Then a cool wind passed over me and the pressure vanished-my body cooled. I shut my eyes and saw her smile, saw it fill her face and clear her eyes. That made my heart jump, that look. I ran after her and she fled, laughing like a little girl. I found her and took her in my arms and said, ""I love you."" I removed the jewelry box from my pocket and set it on the dashboard: white gold, emerald cut diamond. Just as she had wanted. Later, I returned to the car naked. I sat in the driver's seat and took a deep breath. I shut my eyes and felt her hair on my skin, felt her fingers touch my own, felt her lips against mine, felt our bodies press together. She kissed her way down my neck and over my chest to my lap. She took me in her mouth and sucked on me, eyes peering up at me. I cried as I came. I didn't tell anyone about the car-not her parents, or mine, or any friends. None of them would understand. They'd tell me to see a coun- selor. Well, maybe not all of them. Tara's mother might understand. She might understand all too well. Death happens. We all must die. I know that. But death doesn't always mean the end. I sit in the car for hours; sometimes I sleep in it. Some- times I see Stacy in the passenger seat, laughing, smiling. And sometimes, when the smell of peaches and vanilla is really strong, I don't think I'll ever get out of it. I think I'll just stay in the PT Cruiser until I'm a part of it, too. ",candidate00001
2,00001,candidate00002,"I write this sitting at a desk, wind serene about me, clouds forming and unravelling in beautiful shapes above me. I write this, and you are forgiven if you don 't see the shakes in my hands, or notice the hurried scrawl of my writing. I write fast as I have no idea when he might come back to me. According to my watch, it has been three days and roughly six hours since I last held him, and fourteen hours since I last saw him and heard his voice. I 'll be back, Dad, he had said. And I believe him. So I wait for him still. There are noises in the far distance. Weird, animal hoots and growls, and I am certain they are of a kind I have not heard before. The wind smells faintly of cut grass and faintly of rot. I do not know which I prefer, because cut grass reminds me too vividly of home, and sunny, perfect days on the lawn with my son, throwing Frisbees and kicking balls. I can close my eyes and imagine the silk of his translucent yellow hair. I don 't close my eyes too often here, because when I do, the sounds and smells become all the more real, as if I am compensating for the loss of one sense by heightening my others. And so I make the very things I am trying to avoid all the closer. When I try to look for the source of the sounds, it is as if my eyes suddenly cease to focus, and the far distance becomes blurred and pale, as if seen through mist. Only when I return my gaze to the desk do things become sharp again. My son has been gone for over three days, have I said that? I heard him speak those final words after two and a half days searching, and as I called out to him, spinning to look in every possible direction, I was sure I caught a glimpse of his bright red tee shirt. Then it was gone and I am now not so sure I saw anything. I 'll be back, he said. And so I write, waiting for some sign. Waiting for the courage to follow those sounds into the far distance and find my boy. He first showed me the ladder on the day after his eighth birthday. We have a large oak tree at the bottom of our garden, standing monolithlike on the edge of a large but unkempt lawn, all other plants and garden ornaments placed in such a way that they seem to draw the eye to it, although this is wholly unintended. This particular day, my son was standing in front of the tree, looking smaller than ever, and I can still see the way the dappled sunlight played on his face, soft ripples of light turning his hair white and then darkening to a caramel blonde. I loved him more than ever at that moment, I think. If only I had done things differently. You may read that line more than once in this confession? Yes, confession fits. Around the tree was an old garden seat, its deep green paint long ago weather-faded so that it almost seemed part of the tree. It curved around the tree about a third of the way round, and as I watched, my son stepped up on it, reaching to touch the ladder that folded itself around the front of the tree, then continued a curve around its massive girth, ever upwards. It vanished from sight into the branches around the back. I had never seen the ladder before. I stared. My son turned to face me, a look of wild excitement on his face, and even across the distance I could see the sheen in his eyes and the wind in his hair. I think that the look he had is saved specifically for eight year old boys, when every event becomes adventure, every darkness becomes a monster-filled cave, and every anomalous ladder simply another thing to climb just because it is there. The look said, Can I climb it, Dad? Can I? I started towards him, a look of concern obviously showing, for he dropped his hand and stood on the seat, barely able to contain his jittering. I approached the tree, ruffling my son 's hair as I passed and I looked closely at the ladder. As I think back on it, it is a surprise even to me that I felt no shock at seeing it there. It was as if I convinced myself it had always been there and I had just never seen it. It seemed to begin somewhere at the back of the tree, out of sight, its rungs organic and woody, laced with delicate ivy, slick with old moss. I stepped slowly to the side and followed it around the tree. It seemed to curve forever upward and as I stood at the back, it yet again disappeared out of sight, this time around the front of the tree. And there was no sign of its beginnings. I stared. I told myself I had just been at the front of the tree and the ladder did not reappear there as it surely must, looking at it from this angle. I hurried around the tree, following the ladder as I went, and I found myself again at the front, seeing the original perspective. Then again around to the back of the tree where it vanished into the branches. It seemed that wherever I began following the ladder, its origins were out of sight, and it disappeared into the branches at either side. It was the most perplexing optical illusion, and I followed it two more times, coming up with the same conclusion each time. What is it, Dad? my son asked. I grinned at him (and that grin I now feel was the start of it all, as if I had given his excitement the fuel and permission it needed to grow. God, had I but known.), and shrugged, feeling like an excited child myself. I had an idea, and I asked my son to run in the house. He did, dutifully, and I spent the time he was gone walking round and round the tree, following the ladder with my hand, losing it as it became too high, but marking the height of its disappearance and time after time I marvelled at the way the ladder just seemed to begin again at that height (which was always about four feet off the ground) without being visible on the opposite side. My son returned. In his hand he clutched a red crayon, and I took it from him and began to retrace my steps, this time running the crayon along the edge of the ladder. When the ladder became too high to comfortably reach, I marked the height by running the crayon along the trunk itself, picking up the ladder again at the front, impossibly at the same height as it always had been. By the time I had walked around the trunk a further four times, there were five clear lines of red following the ladder 's progress. I must be stooping as I reach the front, I thought as I made a sixth journey. But, no. I wasn 't. I dropped the crayon. It hit me that the sensation was like running my hand around the sharp edge of a giant screw that was boring its way into the earth, so that, give or take depending on my speed around the tree, the height of my hand on the leading edge of ladder remained the same. But, unless I was having a massive leap away from all my senses, the tree did not seem to be boring its way into the earth. I was stumped. You may think that the next logical step was to mount the thing and follow it upwards. Of course. But we didn 't. Not then anyway. I ushered my son away from the tree, distracting him with promises of ice cream and movies and for a day or two, we almost forgot about the ladder. And then he climbed it. He was up it and gone before I knew what was happening. He had a glazed look on his face as if something had called him, hypnotising, and as I ran towards the tree, calling his name so loud that my throat was still hurting three days later, I saw him turn to look at me only once. The look I saw there chilled me then and does still, as I relive it for this account. He looked at once as if he knew exactly what he was doing, and at the same time as if he was being pulled away from all he knew and loved, and his face screamed to me to stop him. The pleading I saw in his eyes, desperate helpless pleading as if it was a stranger on the ladder pulling him upwards rather than the power of his own legs, forced my own legs into a paroxysm of power and I cleared the distance to the tree in seconds. I was too late however, for as I reached the trunk and followed the spiral steps around it, I caught a glimpse of his shoe as it disappeared into the leaves. And then nothing. I ran, I circled the tree hopelessly in the vain hope that I would see him up in the branches, a cruel trick. Of course, I saw no such thing. The ladder wound terminally onwards, ever spiralling, each revolution of the tree seeming to launch it into its ascent anew. Of my son, there was no sign. It was as if he had vanished. I screamed his name up into the branches, scanning their depths for a sign of him, but I saw nothing. The leaves continued their soft waving, and the breeze sighed through them and for a moment I imagined his voice calling me. I thought my heart would break at that moment. I gathered myself for the ascent, and had even stepped onto the bench at the tree 's base, when I heard his soft step. I saw one foot, then the other and I stood paralysed, waiting. Of course, it was him. His hair looked ruffled and was flecked through here and there with seeds and grass. There was a flush to his cheeks, the exuberant glow of a child at energetic play. I reached up to him, snatched him off the ladder and threw us both to the ground, sobbing and clutching him tightly. He was silent, and he shook, I presumed with fear, but as I separated us, and held him at arms length for the admonition that had to come, I saw he was shaking with laughter. Indeed, he seemed paralysed by it, tears coursing down his grubby face, his white teeth shining through the redness of his moistened lips. His silenced ended suddenly in a gasping inrush of air, and I heard the familiar cackle of his laughter. Despite myself, despite my fear and coldness that still caressed my bones, I smiled. The smile grew and I began to laugh with him, caught up by the infection rather than for any genuine humour. I felt his admonishment dissolving in that sound and I hugged him close. Finally we stood and I looked close at him, the laughter subsiding, his eyes trained first on me, but ever glancing towards the ladder, quick and furtive. What happened? Where did you go? I asked him, feeling foolish but unable to rephrase the question so that it made sense to me. Dad, why didn 't you come with me? was his reply. It was fun. Loads of fun! I must have frowned at this, for he focused solely on me for a moment. What happened up there? I asked again. I just played! But it was so much fun, Dad! he replied. The chill of fear began to return, and God help me, for an instance I looked at my son and I swear I had to stop myself looking for the birthmark at the crown of his skull for proof that it really was he who had returned. But you were only gone for seconds! I said feebly. Don 't be silly, Dad. he said as he walked back to the house, absentmindedly brushing grass seeds from his hair. It was hours. Two at least! Why didn 't you come, we could 've played together?! He left me standing at the base of the oak tree, speechless. In a fit of foolishness, of reckless curiosity, I asked him that night of what he had seen, of where the ladder had ended. I wanted to know. The ladder doesn 't end, Dad. I got off in a field and played there for hours. The sun was shining and there was grass and trees and footballs and everything! I asked him what he meant when he said the ladder doesn 't end. I mean it keeps going. It just carried on until I couldn 't see it anymore. Round and round and round the tree. It must be a long walk to wherever it really ends. Do you want to come with me, Dad? he asked. I said no, and that I never wanted him to go back there. I said that we have trees and grass and footballs and everything he would ever need or want right here. I said that the ladder was dangerous and that until we knew what it was and where it came from, I didn 't want him anywhere near it. He reluctantly agreed, and yet his next words confirmed to me that it would be hopeless trying to keep him away. OK, Dad. I 'll see if he can come to play down here. I stared at him. Who 's she '? My friend, he said. My God, I remember thinking. Just how long was he there? For me it was a matter of agonising seconds, but he is talking like he had hours to play and to even make friends. Just who the hell was up there? Is up there still? That night, after my son had gone to bed, I took a glass of wine outside and sat looking at the ladder in the failing light. I walked cautiously down the garden, and felt immediately foolish doing it, and sat with my back to the tree. I shut my eyes and tried to relive the afternoon 's events. I found that the panic and fear I had felt was slipping away (although I wasn 't sure that it wasn 't the wine helping me in that regard). Had my son really been gone for hours, instead of the seconds I had experienced? I even contemplated the notion that I had had some kind of seizure or mental block. I drank and as the sun set and the darkness really set in, I heard the noise. It was like the soft hooting of an owl, which would have been no surprise, but it sounded like it was from another place. By that I mean another I can 't describe any of it without sounding like a mad man. It sounded so ethereal and distant that it could have been coming from another dimension. It didn 't sound like it occupied the same space as the other natural sounds around me, the cars and the wind and the rustle of leaves above my head. I can 't explain it any further. I unconsciously shifted my position so that I half faced the tree and I looked upwards into its darkness. I could see almost nothing of the ladder itself, save for the few feet directly above my head, but it seemed to be emitting light, the faintest fluorescence, its passage through the trees marked with a blue aura. Whereas the solid ladder seemed to vanish into the tree, this aura seemed endless, and looking up at it was like looking into a spiralling image reflected from mirror to mirror, over and over. It had no end that I could see. I coughed, more to break the unearthly silence that had descended, and at that sound the haze vanished and I was left looking up into the tree like some deranged night-time bird spotter. I shook my head to clear it and went back inside, but not before the faint hooting started again. This time it was accompanied by hissing and growling that came from nothing I could imagine, nor would want to. Despite myself, by the time I reached the back door, I was moving at a healthy jog. At breakfast the next morning my son has a wild-eyed look about him, as if the dreams of the night were with him still. I asked him about them, and he said nothing. I saw him glancing past me, through the open kitchen window. Down the length of the garden. I said nothing of my experiences of the previous evening, not the eldritch light, the noises, the feeling of impenetrable depth up into the branches. As I cleared away the breakfast things, I watched my son play in the garden, thinking that to deny him access to the garden and the ladder would only increase his desire to get there. There was an almost deliberate skirting around the tree and the area surrounding it, but I did not fail to notice the looks he shot towards it. I wasn 't so far away that I could not hear him catch his breath each time he came within four feet of the tree. My heart caught at each of his stopped breaths and I imagined myself running from the kitchen, just too late to grasp his heel as he disappeared into the tree. He showed no inclination, however, of climbing again. I began to relax and brewed some tea. I carried the drink into the garden, along with my usual weekend newspaper, and selected the bench at the top of the garden to begin my week-long perusal of it. I had been reading for perhaps ten minutes when I sensed rather than heard a change in the dynamic of his playing. My heart stopped and I stood suddenly, lukewarm tea spilling into the grass. A large drop fell onto the paper, where it ran the ink like blood from a bullet hole. I stared at my son. He stood at the base of the tree, one hand resting casually on the leading edge of the ladder. His hair blew in a wind, but the wind seemed to blow downwards, as if it was coming from directly above him. He nodded slowly, and a wide grin split his face. He spoke, but the words were lost to me. They should not have been. I should have been able to hear him clearly, but I couldn 't. I started towards him, shouted his name, Walk towards me! It seemed he heard me at the last moment, turned to me, and as I saw the look on his face, I broke into a run. It was the look I had seen the last time he had climbed. Pure fear. He seemed to be imploring me to catch him, stealing glances up the ladder so that I was sure he was seeing something up there. He spoke a word, and for the life of me, I was sure it was not English. I have not heard its like before or since that moment. Its guttural bubbling sound was utterly alien coming from my son 's mouth. I saw his eyes roll upwards until they were white, and as he started to slump forward, I threw myself at him in a vain attempt to catch his fall. I was beaten to it, however. A long arm snaked downwards, fastened on a shoulder, and pulled sharply on my son 's body. The hand at the end seemed too long, and thinking back now I know I that I had convinced myself that I saw pink flesh and dark dusting hair on the back of it, and not that dark indigo scaling horror. I know now that it was no human hand that snatched my son. I collapsed onto the grass and stared weakly up into the depths. I saw nothing. No sign of my son or the thing that had taken him. The worst thing of all, perhaps, is that apart from that crawling malevolent word he uttered before he fainted, my son made no noise. There was no cry as he was taken, no sign that he even knew what had happened. Good god, I wasn 't even sure if he was alive. I sobbed into my cupped hands and raced back to the house, my first instinct to phone for help. I stopped myself with my hand in the receiver of the telephone. What on earth would I tell the police? That my son had been snatched up into the canopy by some monster that used a never ending ladder as its route through the tree? They would take me away as soon as look at me. I walked in a daze back to the tree, fearful now that I would see my son 's slumped body at its base, drained of life, and the creature (if that is what it was) crouching above him. The area around the tree was free from such visions and that was somehow worse. I reached the ladder and craned up into the darkness. Nothing. I started back to the house, desperate to do something, knowing there was only one thing that I could do. I fought with myself for minutes, precious minutes that I knew could mean the difference between finding my son and not. I curse those wasted minutes now. Fast, so as I could not stop myself, I rushed back to the start of the ladder, and leapt the first three rungs, running up it using feet and hands. At first I did not take in my surroundings, but it soon became clear that I should have easily cleared the height of the tree, and hadn 't. I slowed my ascent, and looked to either side. I saw a vista so strange and alien to me that I nearly lost balance on the rungs of the ladder. Unthinking, I stepped from it and the ground beneath my feet seemed to thrum as I made contact with it. The earth here was a deep shade of ochre, nothing strange in that, but the grass shooting through it was the colour of spun glass, transparent and yet catching the dull light and throwing out spirals of twisted rainbows in every direction. I reached my hand to it, and snatched it back quickly as the edges parted my skin like razor blades. No playground this, then. As much as I wanted to stay and explore, despite the obvious challenge, I knew (and prayed) that my son was not here and so moved on up the ladder. There seemed no end, each rung a door to as new and equally alien a landscape as that first. A breeze ruffled my hair. I smelled something in that breeze, familiar. It smelled faintly of ice cream and heat and joy, and I recognised the scent of my boy. Like a dog after a trail, I moved my head this way and that, until I thought I had detected a lightly stronger scent off to my right. I shut my eyes to focus on it, and stepped off the ladder. It felt like stepping back onto the land around my house. Smelled the same too. There were noises here, as those I had heard from the base of the tree, hooting and exuberant whistles. I opened my eyes, and saw the table off to one side, the one I am sitting at right now, sitting in a patch of bare ground. The earth was the red colour of the Australian outback. To all sides, I saw fields upon fields of deep yellow corn, alongside tall trees that stretched into infinity. Beneath all of it, the redness of the earth looked like sunburned skin from which the corn grew like hair. I though I saw movement in the corn, shadows and flitting shapes that leaped and cavorted among the dusty stems. I stared harder but this only served to blur the edges of my vision and so I looked away. On the table I saw a pen and paper. Hooked over the back of the chair that accompanied the table, as casually as if it had been at home, was my son 's jacket. I rushed to it, expecting to find something, some warmth in its cloth that would give me a clue. It was cold, and as I drew nearer, I saw splashes of mud coating it. I grabbed it up and crushed my face into it. I shouted my son 's name again and again until my voice cracked and failed me, the sound thinning as it raced across the expanse. Clouds of dust and dried corn husk rose from the fields as if in response to my calls, but I neither received, nor expected, further reply. I sat heavily at the desk, feeling the chair creak under my weight, and spread my son 's coat out in front of me. I absently picked at the flecks of dried mud, thankful it was not blood. I looked down at the red ground, not wanting to see the way my hands shook, not wanting to see the way they looked in the pallid yellow light of this place. My mind was filled with voices, all clamouring to be heard, all saying one thing or another, all mine. I bit down hard on my lip to snap myself out of this destructive thinking. Blood slowly filled the gap between my lower lip and my teeth and as I tasted the bitterness of it, my eyes found something on the ground at my feet. A tiny depression in the hard soil, no more than a fingers length. A swirling pattern in the middle of it, concentric circles the size of a small coin. I jolted in the chair so hard that my thighs caught painfully on the underside of the desk. I stood suddenly, tipping the chair backwards, and still clutching my son 's jacket, I sank so that my face almost touched the earth. The voices in my head quietened suddenly. I knew this pattern. I had seen its like rendered numerous times in mud on the floor of my kitchen. It was my son 's shoe print, I was sure of it, and now that I had seen one, I seemed to see them all. Some were only traces of the print, some more full, and they led in a weaving pattern away from the desk and into the cornfields. What my eyes also found, and what I tried to not see, were the prints next to them, crossing them, scuffing them out. They looked vaguely bird like, long and slender with three distinct trailing scratches at the front each, as if made by three claws dragging with each footstep. I stood and looked around. Apart from the desk and the ladder shimmering blue in the air next to it, all was red earth and yellow corn. Without stopping to think, I tucked the arms of my son 's jacket into my jeans and started following the footprints. The going was hard, strangely so, as if the very ground was holding me back. My feet seemed to drag, and I had the strangest thought that if I possessed sharp claws, they would leave that weird little dragging scratch in the earth like the ones I was following. When I looked down at my feet I saw that the redness of the earth had crept up the legs of my jeans almost to the knee. I thought, no, I knew, that when I looked away the ground would be reaching up again, grasping my legs, slowing me down. I called out my son 's name suddenly, not liking the hoarseness of my voice, but calling again anyway. A flock of birds exploded from the cornfield, black as crows but twice their size at least, oily blueness shimmering from their wingtips in the low sun. They were a way off too, and I had no desire to see them up close. I watched them depart with no little relief. I allowed myself to think that the noise they made as they flew, the barking calls they made unlike any crow I had ever heard, the hissing as their wings exited the dry corn, completely masked the call made by my son as he answered me. Despite their racket, I almost heard him, I am sure of it. If I had made the sound up in my head, would I have added details like the obvious sound of his distress, and the low guttural rumbling that could only have come from his captor? I began to run then, mimicking the birds ' flight with my own, obliterating the footprints and the claw prints, tearing my legs through the grasping soil, seeing a red rain of dust flick from the ends of my shoes as each left the ground. The low rumble that I imagined was the voice of my son 's kidnapper grew louder and I almost thought I saw a flash of indigo scales as it sped away through the corn field. I screamed as loud as I could manage as I ran, the name of my son becoming indistinct, morphing into a single strained syllable of wrenching pain. I thought I heard him again then, all trace of the hypnosis he seemed to have been under gone and simply fear and anger and sadness and loss remaining. I urged my legs to move faster and sensed the ground under my feet responding to this as the creeping redness reached to my knees and then further, clawing at my thighs. Still I ran. Hours passed, or seemed to. My watch was still running, but I wasn 't sure I could trust its timing. In the blink of an eye, hours would pass, and then time would slow so that I seemed to cross vast distances in mere seconds. I heard the shuffling steps of the kidnapper at every twist and turn of the corn plants, and as they slowly merged and then vanished into forests of deep green trees, the sounds grew quieter and eventually stopped altogether. I slept when I literally had no strength to stand, but the sleep was fitful and seemed to last no more than minutes. My watch said differently however, and a day, and then two seemed to pass. I felt time 's progress in the growth of stubble on my face, but in nothing else. I did not eat and I drank what water I could find in the forests, praying I would not sicken before I had found my son. It was perhaps two days, or maybe two and a half when I eventually saw him, I was so shocked that for a moment I didn 't recognise him. He stood some distance from me, on the edge of the forest as it turned back to the red dusty ground. I was close enough to see streaks of tears cutting through the dirt on his face. Close enough to smell him. He stood with his head bowed, and as I scanned around for his tormentor, I saw nothing. I looked back to my son, heart racing, words drying in my throat, and I reached for him. He caught my eye suddenly, and the look in his eyes stopped me cold. It was blank fear, and yet he seemed to be telling me something with tiny movements of his head, shaking this way and that. He looked to his right and then left and again shook his head. I saw a grimace of pain cross his face then, and he crumpled slightly. As I looked to either side of him, and he was lost to the periphery, finally I saw what he was telling me. From the corner of my eye, I saw. The creature was not gone. It stood, its many-jointed, bowed legs dripping moisture and a glistening swollen sac of a body depending from them, its arms wrapped around my son, scaled hands at his throat. It shrouded itself somehow from me, so that when I looked back to my son, it vanished. And yet now I had seen it, I couldn 't un-see it. I gagged with the fear and revulsion, with the pain of seeing my boy harnessed by such horror. The thing tugged at him and he stumbled against the soft body. A mouth opened on its flank, more a raw wet hole than a mouth, but from it issued the same gargling sounds I had heard my son speak in the moments before his abduction. I wasn 't sure if it was talking to me or my son, but I saw him nodding gently, and I sensed his fear subsiding, or at least abating for the moment, both in his eyes and the set of his body. His hands, that had been fisted tightly this whole time, slowly unclenched, and I was close enough to see tiny white crescents on his palms where his fingernails had dug in. Go back, Dad he said, and my heart stopped at the sound of his voice. Go back to the ladder and wait for me. I began to protest, but days with mere mouthfuls of liquid had turned my voice into a silent scratch and I 'm not sure he would have heard even if I had continued. As it was, he held his hands out and implored me. Dad, please! Go back. Wait at the ladder and I will find you. I 'll be back, Dad. I promise. I love you, and I 'll be back. Now GO! The creature wrenched my son onto its back suddenly and now I saw it fully. I gagged again and started running towards the spot where they had been standing, but I was too late. They vanished in a cloud of red dust, and I heard him shout as they went. I 'll be back, Dad I sank to my knees and watch them leave, the dust settling just enough for me to glimpse the bright red of his tee shirt before it was shrouded in distance and mist and dry, cracking corn plants. My raw cry of loss followed them where I could not. I am back at the table, back where I began my story. I wait for my son as any father would. It took me less than a day to find my way back, and I followed what markers I could remember and what footprints remained. The birds were back in the cornfield, their cawing and flapping sounding like the crackle of fire in the dry vegetation. I hold in my mind the sound of him and the sight of him and the smell of him, and I know he will return to me. He promised and I believe him. There are sounds in the distance, have I mentioned that? They seem to be getting closer. I have moved the desk right to the point where the ladder is visible through the trees. I had a moment of inspiration and tied his jacket, which miraculously remained with me this whole time, to the last rung of the ladder that I stepped off. I think I might search for him on further rungs and in further worlds, or even go home. Just for a while, and I know now, or think at least, that I can find my way back here. I have written my son a note explaining what I have planned, but he promised me, and I believe him. I 'll be back, he said. I need to be here when he does. The jacket, still tied to the ladder, is flapping in a soft breeze. It reminds me of home, and the sound, like a kite or a flag in summer, comforts me. Every few minutes, I leave off writing and walk a distance and start calling my son. So far I have heard nothing, but he promised. ",candidate00002
3,00002,candidate00002,"Sunlight dapples my eyelids. My eyes ache more than ever now, and with each new dawn I wake with dread. It is cold too, this morning. A thin layer of frost glues the edge of my coat to the pavement, spikes my hair into messy peaks. I run a hand though it, and hear, in the dead quiet of morning, soft crackles as the spikes dissolve. My nose is icy; my cheeks feel red and chapped. I sit up slowly, aware of pains that are too numerous to single out. The cold smoothness of the glass behind me is running with rivulets of freezing condensation, but it prevents me from falling. As I stretch my legs out, hearing the pops and cracks of my stiff joints, I see that the gloves I am wearing are tattered, both thumbs poking rudely through. I smell terrible, I am sure, but I have long since lost the ability to judge my own odour. I draw up my legs and hug them close to me. The city is still asleep at this hour, and I revel in the quiet. The sun begins to rise, and I imagine that it rises just for me. It is beautiful. I can never forget the desperation of my situation, but I have learned to push it away, hide it in some cloistered corner of my brain, where I daren 't yet mine. My thoughts turn slowly, inevitably, to breakfast. I smile. I have a nice smile, and I am lucky that I still have all my teeth, my skin is clear and smooth, and that my hair is not too unkempt. I am lucky that people still find in them some measure of pity, and I need that. I don 't eat all that often. You have to learn to live on very little, sometimes nothing. I read of a man who survived for over four months on water alone. I try not to better that. I stand and stretch. The sun this morning is truly wonderful. There are long, grey morning shadows, and where they land, small patches of glistening white frost. Everywhere else, it melts quickly. The street lamps flickered out two hours ago, and such is the time of year that they will be flickering back to life in eight or nine hours. My feet are still cold, and I shift them into the sun, stamping lightly. I am not happy, and yet something keeps waking me in the mornings, keeps me going through the motions of day after day. The same thing that has kept me going for nearly thirteen years. I 'm not sure what that something is, but I am sure I will know it when I see it. It is waiting for me. I am standing on a pavement running the length of a quiet city street. My hair is long, my beard thick but relatively un-matted, for I comb it and my hair regularly. I am wearing tatty shoes that have lasted me for ten years or more, and here and there they are held together with strips of plastic bag and parcel tape. Of my three pairs of trousers, I am wearing my worst. The other two are folded into the bag I use as a pillow. Also in the bag are several tee shirts. Over all this I am wearing a dark green ex-army jacket that I found in a skip. It is lined with fake fur, although I am sure that was never army issue. Most of it is hanging torn and shredded like giant cobwebs. I look up and down the street. There are few awake, one or two early rising shopkeepers. I see one now, scurrying like an oversized ant to and from his shop, arms laden with fruit boxes. My mouth begins to salivate. I walk towards the shopkeeper, and as they almost all do, he keeps his head down, content to know of my existence but ignore it. I kick a soft drink can down the road in front of me, and it isn 't until I hear the muted rattle of its passage, that I fully realise the depth of the silence. My breath makes soft white plumes in the air, and I walk through them. The open shop is very close now. The shopkeeper looks up and sees me coming, then looks quickly away. I think that it is possibly because my eyes resemble those of a wild animal, a wolf perhaps. I stuff my hands deep into the pockets of my jacket. The shopkeeper mumbles something incoherent, and I try to be friendly. I nod my head and mumble back. No words, just cautious sounds. I see his arm move suddenly, in a blur, and realise he has thrown something at me. Or rather, to me. My hand snatches the projectile from the air with scarcely a thought, and I break into a wide toothy grin as I feel the cold crisp hardness of an apple in my palm. It is as big as a baseball, red and shiny as fresh blood. I thank him with real words this time and laugh. I bite into the apple, and it is lush and sweet. The juice runs into my beard, but I ignore the stickiness for now. For a moment I can forget where and who I am and enjoy my breakfast. It is over too soon and I throw the core and pips into a dustbin. My hands thread their way back into my jacket pockets, for although it is slightly warmer in the sun, there is still a bitter wind curling its fingers around me. There is a bit more life to the city now. My watch has been broken for four years, but I can guess the time pretty accurately. It is around seventhirty. I see my first car of the morning. Its exhaust belches oily blue smoke, and I watch the plumes twist and cavort in the cold air, thin tendrils reaching after the car like dead hands. I cough deeply, not liking the deep rattle that follows each hacking cough, or the moisture welling in my eyes.. The apple has left tiny slivers of skin between my teeth and I find a park bench and spend a few happy moments picking them out. The street meets with the main road here, and at all four corners of the junction, I can see the city open herself up to me. It spreads as far as I can see. I stretch my legs and drop one on top of the other. For a while, I am content. The sun warms my face and I turn to it, closing my eyes. The city is truly a magnificent place, and here is its true beauty. Here at its heart. Cars appear from nowhere, roaring past, their numbers increasing into a flowing metal stream, the faces of the drivers merging, becoming one face, parts of it content, parts irate, parts distant, as if the people have far more worry on their minds than they outwardly show. I watch them pass. The last piece of apple comes loose and I grind it between my teeth with childish satisfaction. I have been here long enough to nod off, I think. It is perhaps nine o 'clock, probably a little before. The air is humming with life. People travelling to work, to shop. Ah, for those luxuries. I used to work; only now I can 't remember where. A woman sits down next to me. At least, she is on the same bench as me, but is sitting as far away as she can manage, stuffing herself into the corner and studying her fingernails as though they were priceless jewels. I turn to look at her and my heart stutters. I know this woman! I can 't place her name, but I know I was married once. Jean, or Jane. Is this her? I look again and she looks back. I see her face full on. It is not my wife. My heart is beating fast and I grin stupidly. I am sure I appear a madman to her, grinning through a thick swatch of dirty beard. She moves hastily on, as the world does. Her perfume does not share her haste, and hangs lazily in the air. It tickles my nostrils and I fight with a sneeze. It wins. I stand and turn to meet the nestling of shops before me. Which way? I choose straight on because it seems less effort that way. As I walk, I find I am thinking of the woman. Who is she? I ask myself out loud. A couple shoot quizzical looks my way but I ignore them. I must seem no different to the hundreds of babbling tramps that wander this city. My eyes are open but shock flares them wider. My heart races. I think I am wetting myself. A noise, blaring louder and louder until it threatens to split my ear drums, is drilling its way into my head. I can 't place the noise, but suddenly something snaps and it is clear to me. A car horn. I turn to my right and see the car, its grille, like bared teeth, inches from my leg. In the air is the bitter sting of burning rubber. The angry driver is yelling, but the volume of the horn has temporarily deafened me, and I can 't make out the words. I have walked blindly out into the road. Before waiting for me to move, the driver wrenches his car around me, an angry squeal of tyres. I trot quickly to the other side of the road, and rest my weight on a lamppost, breathing heavily. My heart bumps and jitters under my ribs and my legs quiver as if they are about to drop me to the floor. I feel coldness as the air hits the wet patch at my crotch. As I calm, the reality of what happens hits me suddenly. Was I really that close to death? I begin to cry as the relief washes over me. On the tails of relief follow shame and desperation. Would anyone care if I had died? I mean, really care? Still hitching breath, I manage to hobble away past shops and shops and shops. As I walk, a thought hits me so violently that I stagger in the street. What if I had been killed back there? What if the driver hadn 't seen me, hadn 't stopped? Would it be better if I were dead? I list everything I would miss, but the truth of it is I would miss very little. I force the thought away. My knees have stopped their ragged shaking, my heart beats normally. My chest feels abused, raw, but I manage to draw breath. Sleep comes easily when you are homeless, and comes easiest of all when your belly is empty and your body is drained of nutrients and vigour. I find a large tree, this one still frosted from the cold and I wrestle myself into the confines of its buttresses. My bag serves me again as a pillow and I wrap the tattered remains of my coat around my legs, which I have curled under me. My dreams are as ever horrid scaly things invading and tormenting me. I am dreaming of cars, of great shining grilles with teeth that threaten to unravel me. I dream of death and I dream of a man. He has become a friend to me, in past months, and yet I never see his face. I know I twist and contort myself in sleep, but no one cares. I am left to my nightmare. i am standing in sand up to my ankles it is cold and bites into me as if every grain was gifted with bristling needle teeth wind whips around me but i have no coat nothing to warm my freezing skin as i look down at myself i see i am completely naked my skin is peaked infinitely with goose-bumps blue with the cold there is nothing to see the dreamscape is as desolate as i always feared it would be dunes upon dunes of billowing sand white as if sun bleached but there is no sun the wind drops but the cold remains as if it is within me i start to walk forward i think but there is no front or back here north is as south is as east is as west up is as down i appear as white as the biting sand motionless emotionless a man is walking towards me now out of the distance he has always been there waiting my dream-self it is the friend i have had in every dream i can remember i am jealous of his robes that drape across his wide shoulders of the cowl that protects his face from the sand the sand always the biting sand i know that if i were to remove that cowl he would appear as i do my twin i laugh he echoes the sound his laugh is dead flat cold coming across the wastes of sand i raise my hands and he copies i am drugged my limbs heavy i fight it and it is winning the man beckons and i walk towards him passing oceans of bleached sand still the man remains distant always the same number of footfalls away from me he is walking away as i walk towards and yet we are facing each other he stops tilts his head i tilt mine and i wonder who is leading who am i him? is he me? my nakedness is covered now by a robe like his and we could be as one i draw back the hood of the robe hoping he will do the same as i watch the man finally draws the cowl from his own head and i recoil unable to stop myself it is plainly me i am looking at the same awkward tilt to my mouth the same deep set eyes the same wide cheekbones and high forehead and where my own face is bristling with beard his is clean no hair on it whatsoever i see the reason suddenly he is burned this version of me horribly burned so that his face appears nothing more than a pasty mass of scar tissue i could be looking at death itself and then it smiles at me the scars bunching and stretching horribly around the mouth and eyes i scream my own face wrinkles in sympathy and i feel i could reach right to him and pull the mask off if i were to do so i would see myself underneath i reach towards this hideous parody expecting it to retreat but it doesn 't expecting myself to finally wake but I don 't suddenly I am next to it a reverse mirror image of it of me breathing the reek from it from the glistening maw that is its face its eyes have gone it no longer looks human like me its arms are wizened claws and they clutch at me so violently I am thrown off my feet my lungs seize and breath is expelled in one long desperate gasp it reaches again for me its wizened arms reaching higher and higher until it grasps my throat tightly I gasp as it pushes my head down I present the crown of my head to it wait for the killing stroke it doesn 't come it takes my skull strangely soft into its putrid maw it melds to the contours of the thing 's palate my chin is resting on its tongue and i can hear the boiling acid in its stomach i vomit at the stench of it i can see down the throat down the oesophagus that is a wasted tube of dead flesh the pressure from its grasping hands relaxes considerably but i do not try to pull my head from its jaws i feel a profound loss every time i move so i remain still push my head further in blind now to the sights and smells of it and it begins to feel warm and soft sensual almost i am an infant now the baby is crying and i know that it is crying not through fear or hunger but rather because everything it has ever known the womb the warmth has been wrenched from it cruelly because it knows that all it will experience now is pain dirt excretion hurt i hear a deep laugh beginning in the creature 's gut my laugh of course as i realise who it is who i am death and now this feeling i have as i kiss the insides of the creature 's mouth rub my face into the soft tongue caress the fleshy softness i recognise it as the feeling of being born back to the womb back to the sensual protective darkness that begins life and inevitably must end it i reach my hands up and the jaws open wider to accommodate me i start to clamber frantically inside using my legs to push deeper it seems impossibly big as i begin to disappear into the putrid blackness suddenly the mouth shuts behind me and i am left in pitch blackness i yell hawking great lungfuls of stinking air to fuel my cries as a great snaking umbilical cord wraps itself around me and i writhe against its greasy pulsing length suddenly it grows tight and pulls me in the mouth starts to tip me forwards i know it means to swallow me and i feel tingling anticipation it means to end my life or begin my death it is the same i reach into the throat meaning to pull myself further in i encounter rows of viciously serrated teeth i pull my hands away from the pain and find them hopelessly ruined and torn a violent tipping of the tongue and i am gone deep deep into the cave of its throat deep into myself for we are one and the same the teeth rake at me i am a foetus curled and defenceless i smell the pit of its stomach feel splashes of the acid on my face and arms before i die i hear the laughter again then nothing Then I am awake and it is afternoon. The sun is sinking already so I know it must be at least four thirty. I stink of piss and I must have vomited in my sleep. I see there is blood in the mess beside me. I feel strange. Never in my thirteen years as this vagabond have I felt such peace. I feel terribly warm, and yet I can see from the hats and scarves, and from the frosty plumes of breath around me, that it is cold. As I stand and stretch, I realise suddenly what it is I have been searching for these years. It pops into my head as sharply and audibly as a snapping twig. I am looking for Death. Quite simply. I have lived this life of misery for too long and I am sick of it. Sick of the hunger, the cold, the thirst. Sick of the danger, the withering stares and the illness that are constant bed fellows. I am lonely and desolate, all I have or once had is gone, extinguished like a fragile flame. I have the answer now. Death awaits me, reaching to me with arms that promise peace and calm and happiness. It is so simple. I shrug off my coat and stand in the chill of the winter evening. I feel no cold. I laugh and laugh. As I walk from my bed, I slip my arms into my jacket, preferring the ease of wearing it to the clumsiness of carrying it. The air has become cold, and I can almost taste the thinness of it. The idea of dying does not fill me with the cold dread it once did. Instead, I feel a longing for the peace that has evaded me for as long as I can remember. The grass crunches under my feet. The frost has returned, and I prepare for a cold night. I begin to think of food; begin to return to the routine of finding food, eating food and finding shelter. I then realise that I have other plans ahead, and that finding food and shelter need not figure in them. The man in my dreams surfaces in my mind again, shrouded and darkened behind his cowl. I long for his final touch. I find another tree and lie beneath it. I have vague memories of trying to kill myself once. Seven years ago. Perhaps I knew then what I know now? What I desire now? Perhaps not. Stolen headache tablets, spread in a pile like a tiny snow-capped mountain. I remember the sound they made as they tumbled and clattered against one another. Swallowed slowly, one by one, washed down with a half bottle of vodka. My hands were steady, and my heart a peaceful rhythm. It comforted me as I prepared for my death. How many heartbeats left? Three hundred? A thousand? Ten? Nothing seemed to happen for a long time. I dozed and woke with metronomic regularity, and then There was light suddenly all around me, and pain stabbed my gut like a knife. My face contorted with agony, eyes flared and mouth frothed like a horse in the throes of madness. The brightness changed. Occasional flashes of colour, too bright for me to register. My head seemed to lift from my shoulders and there was a roiling in my gut. Vomit spewed across my legs. Black in the moonlight, presumably with blood. Still my head rose and I felt I could turn to look down at my thrashing, spasming body below me. My stomach rose and fell rapidly, and with each new contortion, a fresh gobbet of vomit spattered me. My head sank suddenly without warning and by degrees the contortions slowed and stopped. Sudden blackness. I fell to my jacket and let death take me. And yet I woke and lived. And lived. The memory is now too much for my fragile mind. I am sick, violently, fall into blackness again. I become aware of the warmth of the sun on my face as I wake. I realise with some dismay that I am still alive. I 'm hollowed out, like a shell, my innards wrenched from their moorings like so much crab meat. I stare at the splatter of vomit across my legs and see undigested apple littering the dark redness like stars in a dusky sky. Tears wet my cheeks as I try to stand and fall back, weakened. Death won 't come for me. I know that now. I will have to find Death. Urgency lifts me. I must do this. I realise I am chanting this mantra. I must do this. The city is alien, death everywhere suddenly. I feel like a tourist, death 's tourist, among the throng. All seems strange to me, as if I hadn 't looked it every day of my life for thirteen years or more. My head feels crushed and my neck and stomach muscles feel stretched, violated. I feel cold without my coat. I stagger across ever busying streets, mindless to the traffic, the screeching tyres, wailing horns. I walk through crowds of people that aren 't there. Dark roads lead off the main street and the perspective of the houses that line them draws me into their darkness, like a wooded path in a fairy tale. I take the furthest one from the bustle of the city. Front yards and pavements are littered with the corpses of deceased bicycles, shopping carts and old shoes. Windows in the houses nearest the entrance to the road are clean and sparkle in the sun. Further in they are either smashed or boarded over like wounds. I encounter few people. Those that I do see avert their eyes. Soon enough I stop looking at them and walk. Hunger gnaws at me pointlessly. At the last house on the road, facing me before a broken fence and miles of increasing dark, the door hangs limply open. A mattress juts like a tongue, and the windows are half lidded with yellowing net curtains. As if I have been led here, my heart quickens as I walk up the path and enter the house, the first I have been in since leaving my own The stench of the place hits me like a slap, and I reel, noticing as I do the discarded needles like a glassy snow drift in one corner. I walk in a fugue through to what I presume is a sitting room and pain flares suddenly, violently in my head, ringing at my temple. My legs collapse and I am dead weight on the carpet. A man is standing over me, a torrent of words escaping him, or so I imagine. I seem to have gone deaf and the blow blurs my senses. The pain fades as the man hits me again. I have time to study his face, pocked and drawn, a cheese-white blot with hollow eyes like burns. I see a flash of metal. The man berates me further, although I am still deaf to his ranting. I try to tell him I have no need for his drugs but he hits me again, and follows that with a flurry of kicks, surprisingly solid despite his apparent frailty. The metal flashes again and I have time to register a blade. Just. Heat blooms in my chest and I see I am skewered. Blood oozes slowly around the handle and coats the blade. I laugh. The man withdraws the knife, and I recognise and appreciate the look of horror on his face. Can I thank him? If only he knew. I try, between giggles. Everything blurs again and the pain seems unable to creep through the fug. My laughter further enrages him and he stabs me again. Pain now as the blade slips delicately between ribs into my heart. A sickening release and blood courses from the wound. Greyness edges across my vision, and my last true sight is of the man turning, dropping the knife. I watch the blood slip from its gleam as it lets go its hold on my fluids. Blackness. There is the sound of my heart beating its last and then there is nothing. No sound, no sight, no feeling. It is as if I have ceased to exist, except that I am somehow aware of this fact. I suffer a moment or two of this nothingness and then I feel cold biting wind and hear the rustle that I know is the sound of grains of sand knocking and jostling over one another. i am standing in sand up to my ankles it bites i as if every grain was gifted with bristling needle teeth in front of me is my twin its jaws drop wide and i begin my climb into the maw once again the smells and sounds of death affront me and to accent them is the throb where the drug addict 's knife ended me i lay my head on the glossy tongue stroke my arms wide across it it becomes as a second coupling with a new lover no less exciting anticipative but less anxious and fearful familiar i rub my face and torso into the floor of this cavern i curl like the foetus i am becoming and begin sucking on my thumb i almost cry out as i feel the greasy umbilical cord join me to the twin who swallows me a pulsating movement underneath and the floor of the cave softens further blackness begins to drop from the fleshy walls as the mouth decays around me i sink a way into the tongue as it rots it starts to tip me down the throat and the teeth begin their work anew tearing me and pulling me in i cry out and attempt to withdraw my arms are caught and are shredding pain washes like fire and i scream i manage to release myself somehow i am free for seconds until my legs are snagged on the grasping teeth that seem to have life my legs are stripped of skin and then of flesh as they are pulled further in i scream again and beg for it to stop but of course it doesn 't not when my chest is punctured not when the teeth reach my neck and tear at the skin there it doesn 't stop when the umbilical tears loose sending viscera spilling hotly down the rotting tube of its throat and when the pain seems to have reached its peak it doubles and triples and magnifies by multiples of thousands as my skull is crushed by the peristalsis within the rotting tube of its throat my brain presses against the bone briefly before being forced out through nose and mouth and ears i moan no longer able to scream how am i still aware i beg again for it to stop and still it doesn 't and it swallows finally i boil in its acids a fleshy pulp and still unmercifully aware to the end of my pain and plight i have no form only feeling and so am forced to experience my own dissolution digestion excretion this last fills me with such anguish that i scream and scream and scream silently once out of the creature my soul turns and watches as the creature slinks away no longer pretending human form i can make no sense of it i hang in the air over a pile of this creature 's shit in the mess are clearly definable shapes a femur here ribs there caging a domed segment of my skull as i watch the wind picks up and the shit starts to crumble already drying the bones crumble with it crumble into dust into into into suddenly it hits me My death is nothing. No pleasures. No sensuality. It is not the comforting womb that I believed it to be. It is simply a cold, biting desert. My bones have vanished. I make the connection. I realise. If I had a heart, and it hadn 't already been pierced, surely it would burst. The creature has tricked me. This desert is death. It is nothing more or less than the powdered bones of billions of tricked souls just like me. He has shit them all out to rot and crumble among the bone-white sand. Bone-white because it is bone. And here I am too. I fear I will never be unaware. Mercy will not visit me. Or rather, us. I can hear so many others crying with me. I am no different now. My death is a grain of sand in a desert. My crying joins the cacophony and it is a horrible sound. ",candidate00002
4,00001,candidate00003,"When Clem Jenkins walked into the bait shop with that big red cooler, we all knew what he was up to. He was the best fisherman in the county, and he was about to prove it to us again. ""Catch anything?"" one of the customers at the minnow pool asked as Clem lugged the cooler over to the scales. Someone snickered. ""Of course he caught something,"" someone else said. ""He always catches something."" ""Just gather round boys,"" Clem said so everyone would hear, ""and I'll show you what's biting this morning."" Truth be told, a small crowd had already formed around the scales. Clem seldom disappointed us, and today would be no exception. He flipped open the top of the cooler, and stuck both hands inside. He paused for a moment for dramatic effect. ""Get on with it Clem,"" Bill said with a touch of envy in his voice. Clem grinned at him. ""Anybody here interested in bass fishing?"" he said, knowing that that was about the only thing most of us were interested in. ""Well boys, feast your eyes on this."" Clem stood up and the room fell silent for a moment, except for Fred who let out a long, low whistle. ""Jeez, Clem, that looks big enough to take the state record,"" I said. I didn't even try to hide how jealous I was. ""It looks big enough, but it ain't. State record's 15 pounds, two ounces. This baby weighs in at 14 and a half."" We all agreed that it was still a respectable catch, and Jim went behind the counter to grab the Polaroid to commemorate the event. Jim always posted pictures of the big catches on the wall behind the cash register. There were a few of me up there, but pictures of Clem and his trophy-sized fish dominated. ""Hell Clem, why don't you come back when you've caught a big one,"" I teased. It was only 9:30 and there was still a good two hours of fishing left before the water got too warm. ""Nah, I decided to quit early today. It just didn't seem right to catch all of big ones and not leave any for you guys."" The guys laughed. I did too, but I couldn't let him off that easy. ""Some of us might have a chance to catch one of those big ones if you'd ever let on where your secret spot is."" ""There is no secret spot, Charlie, the secret's in the bait."" Several people nodded in agreement. ""Clem you know that's not exactly true. We all use the same bait."" Clem was formulating his answer when we were interrupted by the bell on the front door. Everyone turned to look at the newcomer. He was tall and built like a man who spent most of his time behind a desk. He was dressed like the cover of an Eddie Bauer catalog. ""Yes sir,"" Jim said. ""Can I help you?"" The stranger took the scene in for a moment, then said ""Yeah, the lady at the motel said I could hire a guide here to do some fishing."" ""Well, she told you the truth. What kind of fishing are you looking to do?"" I could see the question confused him. I could also see that he was going to try hard not to let on. ""Uh, I read that the Bass fishing up here is really good."" ""It sure is,"" Jim said. ""You after small mouth, or large mouth?"" Some of the guys had to suppress a grin. The newcomer was what we called a weekender, a tourist who liked to swing down from the city and spend some time away from it all. For the most part we didn't really mind the weekenders. We needed their money. The only problem was, some of them knew it. ""Which one is biggest?"" the weekender continued. ""Large mouth,"" Jim said. ""Clem here just caught one that weighed over 14 pounds."" By now, Clem had put his fish back in the cooler, and was busy gathering his things to leave. The weekender looked over to Clem. ""Well, how about it?"" he asked. ""How about what?"" Clem answered and bent over to pick up his cooler. ""Are you a fishing guide?"" Clem was a licensed guide, and a good one, too. But he didn't like working for weekenders. Clem stood up. ""Yeah, I'm a guide, but my schedule's full right now."" The weekender looked a little surprised. He seemed like a guy who was used to having things his way. ""Well, I'd be willing to pay you something extra to find some time in your schedule."" Clem looked uninterested. The weekender checked his watch. It was a Rolex. ""Look, I've got some things to do today. Why don't you just take a deposit, and I'll meet you back here at 3 to work out the details."" Clem started to say something when the weekender pulled out two crisp hundred dollar bills. He folded them in half, reached out, and stuffed them in Clem's shirt pocket. ""See you at three,"" he said, and walked out the door. After he left, Jim spoke up. ""Can you believe the nerve of that guy? Driving up here in his Mercedes and acting like he owns all of us."" Bill wasn't too pleased either. ""Screw him, Clem. You don't need any money from guys like that."" It was strange, but Clem was the calmest of all of us. ""It isn't anything to get worked up about fellows,"" Clem said. ""The guy wants me to take him fishing, so I'll take him fishing."" Clem and I spent the rest of the morning getting things ready for the trip. Clem had his own boat, of course, but mine was in better shape and had those nice padded seats that Clem liked so much. We had lunch together at the diner, and made it back to the bait shop in time to load up the boat with supplies. Jim always stocked plenty of beer and sandwich fixings at the bait shop. Plus, Clem and I both qualified for the 10% fishing guide discount. We were outside making the final preparations when the weekender pulled up. He drove a Mercedes alright, but it was the sport utility model. It looked out of place next to my rusty Ford pickup. The weekender got out and walked up to Clem. ""Glad to see you've found some time,"" he said. ""What do I need to take with me?"" Clem said he'd need a license, and might want to buy some bug spray and sunscreen. ""You can buy everything inside,"" Clem added. ""Fine. How much are we talking about for this trip?"" I smiled. It was always the guys who threw money around who were the most concerned about the price of the trip. ""Trip costs $300. That includes all your gear, plus dinner. I'll also clean and filet any fish you catch, and pack them so you can take them back with you."" The weekender made a face. ""No thanks,"" he said. ""I hate fish. If it's big enough, I'll have it mounted. Otherwise you can just throw them back."" Clem didn't look surprised. ""OK then, let's get you a license,"" Clem said, and walked into the bait shop. Inside, Jim already had everything laid out. The weekender filled out the license application and paid the fee. I walked back to the storage room and came back with the blue cooler. ""What's in there?"" the weekender asked as I struggled through the door. ""Bait,"" I replied. ""Everyone around here knows the secret's in the bait."" The answer seemed to satisfy him. Everything was all loaded up, and I was sitting in the truck by the time Clem and the weekender came out of the bait shop. They climbed into the front seat. Clem had to sit in the middle, but it didn't matter because we weren't going too far. I tried to start a conversation, but was interrupted by the weekender's cell phone. ""Yeah speak up I'm on vacation fishing no Monday or Tuesday "" It went on in that vein for the rest of the drive to the lake. The boat lauch went smoothly and we were all on the lake by five. I drove the boat, and Clem baited the hooks. The first place we tried was a bust. Clem got a few nibbles, but the weekender and I didn't even get that. We moved on to a second spot. The sun was getting low in the sky. ""That's good for us,"" Clem said. ""The fish start to feed again in the evening."" We settled in, and in just a few minutes, Clem got a solid strike. He was paying attention to the weekender, though, and didn't set the hook in time. ""Damn,"" Clem muttered, ""got my bait."" The weekender was starting to get antsy. ""At least you got a bite,"" he complained. ""I've been out here with you for two hours, and haven't even gotten that."" He stopped short of asking for his money back, but Clem and I both knew that he was about to. ""Let's try one more place,"" Clem suggested. We reeled in our lines and headed out across the lake. It was almost dark, and I had to navigate by the lights of the town on the far shore. ""This is good here,"" Clem shouted over the buzz of the motor. I reached out and cut it off. The lake was beautifully calm, and Clem made his way to the front of the boat. He pulled out a flashlight and shined it onto his rod and reel. The weekender picked up his rod also. ""I'm out of bait,"" he said. Clem tossed him the flashlight. ""Here you go. Bait's in the blue cooler."" The weekender leaned over and popped the lid of the cooler. I watched his face as the light from the flashlight shined inside. I could see his wide eyes, and I hit him hard with the oar before he had a chance to scream. Clem looked at him for a second, then rolled him out of the boat and held him under water for a few minutes just to be sure. It was pretty late by the time we made it back to the bait shop. Jim and a few of the guys were waiting for us. ""Catch anything?"" Jim asked. Clem smiled. ""Biggest one yet."" Several heads nodded. Clem paused for effect, then added ""The secret's in the bait, you know.""

5,00002,candidate00003,"Buzz! All eyes in the office looked up at the red light on the intercom speaker. ""Johnson! Get in here!"" a gruff voice boomed out. Six workers breathed a sigh of relief while the seventh felt a tight knot forming in his stomach. Buzz! ""I meant now!"" the voice boomed out again. ""You better go Joe, you know he just gets worse the longer he has to wait,"" Betty the secretary whispered across her desk. ""How can he get any worse?"" Joe said over his shoulder as he headed towards the door. Buzz! Joe knocked loudly. ""It's about time!"" a voice yelled out from behind the door. ""Get in here!"" Joe rushed into the room. Before he could do anything, his boss shouted again. ""Close that door!"" Joe shut the door gingerly and prepared for what had become an almost weekly ritual. ""I've got your sales figures in front of me Johnson,"" the boss pointed to a short stack of papers on his large, executive-style desk. ""And I've got to tell you that they are pathetic with a capital 'P'!"" Joe reacted to each of the spat out syllables as if they were gunshots. ""Yes sir, Mr. Miller, but,"" Joe began. Miller cut him off. ""Don't 'but' me. I've had about enough of your loafing around here. I hire salesmen to sell,"" he raised a finger and pointed it at the quarterly sales chart on the wall for emphasis. ""And if you can't handle the job, I'm going to have to find someone who can!"" He stuffed his unlit cigar into his mouth and chomped down on it angrily. Joe stood silently for a moment, trying to gather his thoughts. ""But, Mr. Miller, I've got a family to support,"" Joe said in a plaintive voice. ""So do I Johnson,"" the boss interjected. ""So do I. And if I don't see an improvement out of you by next week's report, you're fired, or my name isn't Larry Miller!"" ""But,"" Joe stammered. ""No buts! Now get out!"" The boss pointed at the door behind Joe. Joe knew a good opportunity when he saw one, and he didn't waste any time getting out of Mr. Miller's office. Outside, his fellow workers tried, unsuccessfully, to pretend that they hadn't heard what had transpired. They all sat nervously, desperate for Joe to say something about it first. Betty was the first to break the silence. ""Don't take it so hard Joe,"" she said softly. ""We all know how he can be."" ""Thanks Betty,"" Joe said weakly. Six pairs of eyes followed him back to his desk and watched as he plonked down in his chair and started to shuffle through the papers on his desk. They were polite enough not to say anything else. On the way home that evening, Joe's mind was racing. ""What am I going to tell Karen?"" he asked himself over and over. ""What am I going to say?"" As he was imagining how he would break the news to her, he suddenly remembered the shopping list in his pocket. Karen had asked him to pick up a few things on the way home. ""Oh great,"" Joe thought. ""I've screwed that one up too."" He was too far along to turn back to the store now. He pulled the list out of his pocket and read it between brief glances at the road. ""Hmmmm. Eggs, butter, apples, flowers,"" Joe read silently. Joe resented that Karen had written ""flowers"" on the list. It was a reminder that he had been neglectful of her and the kids lately. But, he rationalized the guilty thought away quickly. Between his job and his boss, he didn't see how he could do things any other way. ""Besides,"" he added to his mental explanation, ""it's my paycheck that is buying the stuff on this list."" With that thought, Joe looked up in time to see a handpainted sign on the side of the road. ""Cain's Apples- Farm Fresh Produce- 2 mi. ahead,"" Joe read as he sped by. ""Well, at least I can get one thing on this list,"" he decided, and put it back into his shirt pocket. As he crested the top of a hill, Joe could see the apple stand in the distance. It was a little larger than he expected, which surprised him because he didn't remember ever seeing it there before. He pulled on the shoulder, turned off the engine, and looked at the stand for a moment. It had two signs in front, a large on that said ""Cain's Apples,"" and a smaller one that said ""Open"" in large red letters. It looked as if the farmer had just brought in three white sheds on a big truck and dropped them off in the middle of the night. A small generator was off to one side, and it had a cord attached running into the back of the first shed. Each shed had baskets of apples neatly arranged on shelves, with small signs indicating the variety. Joe hadn't seen anything like it around the area since he was a teenager, and the sight of it brought back fond memories. Joe checked his pocket for his list, got out of the car, and walked up to the stand. He was in luck. The generator was loud and powering a small refrigerator. A sign on top said that they sold eggs and butter. There were also several bunches of flowers in a big water can on a shelf. They were daisies, Karen's favorite. ""Can I help you?"" Joe was startled by a voice behind him. He turned and looked at a man he assumed to be Mr. Cain. Joe thought his bright blue eyes didn't match his tanned and weather-beaten face. ""Oh, hi, do you have any eggs or butter left?"" Joe asked somewhat nervously. ""Don't know,"" the farmer said in a friendly voice, ""let's take a look."" He stepped past Joe and peered into the refrigerator. ""You're in luck,"" Cain said from the back of the refrigerator. He pulled his head out and looked at Joe. ""How many do you want?"" ""Just a dozen of the eggs, and I'll take a pound of butter if you've got it,"" Joe said. ""Sure, sure,"" the farmer answered in his calm and slow voice. ""Anything else?"" Joe looked over at the water can. ""Yeah, um, how much for the flowers?"" Cain smiled knowingly. ""Two dollars a bunch."" ""Great,"" Joe said, imagining the pleased look on Karen's face. ""I'll take two bunches."" Cain wrapped the purchases in brown paper before placing them on the small table where he had a metal cash box. He looked at Joe. ""Something else?"" The way he phrased the question made it sound as if he knew that there was. Joe pulled out his list and read it again. ""Oh yeah, I also need some apples,"" Joe said when he was done. ""What for?"" Cain shot back. The question threw Joe. ""What do you mean?"" he managed to ask through his confusion. Cain saw the problem. ""No, I mean what will you use them for, cooking or eating?"" Joe seemed relieved. ""Oh, cooking. My wife wants to bake an apple pie."" Cain looked pleased. ""I've got just the thing, let me show you."" He led Joe a few feet over to shed number three and pointed at a tub filled with small green apples. Joe eyed them suspiciously. ""What kind are they?"" Joe asked. Cain hooked a thumb under a suspender and rocked back slightly on his heels. ""Well, these here are hard and sour,"" he began. Joe started to shake his head. Cain raised his hand. ""Now hold on, you're probably thinking about eating apples. These here are for cooking."" Joe listened politely. Cain continued with some enthusiasm. ""For pie, you want a firm apple, one that's not too sweet. Otherwise, you'll end up with applesauce instead of apple pie once you add the sugar and put it in the oven."" The logic appealed to Joe, and he told Cain he'd take two pounds. Cain packed everything in a cardboard box and handed it to Joe. Then he carefully added the prices on a little notepad and handed the result to Joe. Joe paid, thanked the farmer, and carried the box back to his car. He was about to drive off when he remembered his original question. He pulled closer to the stand, rolled down the window, and called out to Cain over the noise of the generator. ""Hey, Mr. Cain!"" Cain turned around. ""The apples, what are they called?"" Cain leaned forward and cupped his hands around his mouth. ""Larry Millers,"" he said. Joe paused for a second with a puzzled look on his face. He started to say something, but then thought better of it. The generator was too loud. With a wave and a nod, he drove off for home. The turn for Joe's house came sooner than he expected. He was distracted, thinking about the events of the day, when he saw the sign announcing ""Welcome to Shady Brooke."" He turned right, past the manicured flower beds and the ornate fountain, then made a left into his culde- sac. Joe remembered the look on Karen's face when they first moved into the neighborhood. The house and the mortgage were both too big for them then, but two children soon took care of the first problem, and his current job had taken care of the second. Joe shook his head slowly when he thought about what to say to Karen about the events of the day. It wasn't going to be easy. ""I'm home,"" Joe announced, closing the door behind him with his foot. He set his box of groceries on the table and looked out the window in the back yard. Karen was engaged in a heated discussion over the fence with Fred Kimball, grouchy neighbor extraordinaire. The argument ended abruptly, and Karen walked inside, looking a little worse for wear. ""Oh, hi,"" she said, slightly startled to see Joe standing there. ""When did you get home?"" ""I just walked in,"" Joe answered. ""What did he want this time?"" ""Fred's complaining about the fence and the property line again,"" Karen answered in a tired voice. She looked behind him at the table. ""You remembered the groceries, thanks."" ""Yeah,"" Joe replied, ""I found a fruit stand on the way home. The guy there told me that those apples were good for baking."" Karen was examining one closely. It passed her muster, and she transferred the whole batch to the counter. ""These are fine,"" she said. She didn't mention the flowers. ""How about an apple pie for dessert?"" Joe smiled wanly. ""Yeah, that would be great."" He spent the rest of the evening watching television and chatting with Karen about her day. At dinner, he avoided telling her about his problems at work. ""Why tell her now?"" he thought, ""It will only make her worry."" Karen could sense something was wrong, but chose to ignore it. She didn't like to discuss important things in front of the children. After dinner, she brought her fresh baked pie to the table and carefully cut a slice for each of them. The family agreed that it was delicious. Joe slept fitfully that night, and left for work 15 minutes earlier than usual. He wanted to make sure he would be on time today. He arrived a few minutes early, and had already made his first call of the day when Betty came in looking agitated. ""What's the matter?"" Joe asked with some concern. Betty was one of his few allies in the office. ""Joe, haven't you heard? Mr. Miller's had a stroke."" Joe looked at her with wide eyes. ""Really? When?"" ""Last night around 7:30. He's in the hospital now."" She started to choke up. ""They don't think he's going to make it."" Joe's grave look hid the sense of relief he felt inside. ""A stroke? Miller? Ha ha, this is almost too good to be true,"" he thought, before catching himself. Aloud he said in his most sympathetic voice, ""I am so sorry to hear that."" Betty acted as if she didn't hear him and sat absentmindedly at her desk. Joe returned to his and waited for some word. It came a little after two. Larry Miller died at 11:15 am from complications following a severe stroke. Betty took the phone call. The office closed early because of the news, and Joe was on the road by three. On the way home he contemplated the new turn of events. ""I still can't believe this,"" he thought with excitement. ""I'm off the hook."" With Larry Miller dead, Joe figured his job was safe, at least for a while. He was thinking about how glad he was that he didn't tell Karen when he saw the sign out of the corner of his eye. ""Cain's Apples- Farm Fresh Produce 2 mi. ahead."" With a chill, Joe suddenly remembered what the old man at the stand had sold him. Larry Miller apples. ""He knew,"" Joe said half-aloud. ""He knew."" Stepping hard on the gas peddle, Joe raced to the fruit stand and brought his car to a halt in a cloud of dust and gravel. The sign in front said ""Open,"" but Cain wasn't there. Joe called out. ""Hello! Anybody there?"" No answer. He looked behind the sheds and was about to leave when he heard a familiar voice behind him. ""Can I help you?"" Joe wheeled about and saw the same bright blue eyes and the same weathered face. ""You startled me,"" Joe said. ""Sorry about that,"" Cain replied with a warm smile. ""What can I get you today?"" Joe pondered his reply for a few moments. His thought about the apples began to seem silly to him. The generator was still banging away in the background. ""I'd like some apples,"" he finally said, sheepishly. ""Well, we've got apples,"" Cain said with good humor. ""What do you need them for?"" ""You like tart apples, or sweet ones?"" Cain asked as he rummaged through a large tub. Joe watched carefully as the old man grabbed several apples and held them up for Joe to see. ""Well mister, tart or sweet?"" Joe weighed the choices. ""Tart,"" he said all of a sudden, without quite knowing exactly why. ""You'll like these then,"" Cain said and started filling a bag with scruffy green apples. ""They're sometimes a little bitter, but for the most part they're very good."" Mr. Cain finished filling the bag and handed it to Joe. ""That'll be $1.50,"" he said, and opened up his little metal cash box. Joe paid him. ""One more thing,"" Joe said hesitatingly. ""What are they called?"" Cain's blue eyes lit up, and he smiled slightly. ""Pahchay,"" he said. ""Pahchay?"" Joe asked again. ""Never heard of it."" ""It's an old variety,"" Cain explained, ""first developed 73 years ago in Delaware."" Joe wanted to ask more, but had already started to feel slightly embarrassed about his suspicions. This was an apple stand, that's all. It was time to go home. ""Thanks,"" Joe said and turned to leave. The generator was blaring in his ear. Mr. Cain yelled out behind him after he got into the car. ""Pahchay's the Latin name you know. The locals call them Fred Kimballs."" Stunned, Joe turned to look at Cain. The stand was empty. Joe sped off from the stand, the bag of apples beside him on the seat. He rolled down his window and tossed the bag out. The car behind him swerved to avoid it, but ran over it anyway. When the driver honked loudly, Joe gave him the finger. On the way home, Joe's mind was revving faster than his car's engine. ""I can't believe this,"" he said to himself. ""There has got to be a rational explanation."" He was still thinking that when he turned out the lights for bed that evening. He had gotten home at 4:30. The ambulance arrived for Fred Kimball a little before six. That week, Joe looked for the apple stand every day on his way home from work. He was having trouble sleeping and, according to Karen, was also short-tempered and irritable. ""Joe, I don't know what's wrong with you these past few days,"" she said on Friday after dinner. Joe hated Fridays. The kids were usually out of the house, and Karen used the time to address family concerns. ""Nothing's wrong,"" Joe said curtly. ""Don't give me that,"" Karen said. ""You've been like a stranger this whole week, yelling at me, snapping at the kids."" ""Look, I said nothing's wrong, alright?"" Joe said. Karen threw her napkin on the table and stood up. ""I don't know why I even try,"" she said bitterly and walked out to the kitchen. ""I don't either,"" Joe called after her. ""Why don't you save it for your handyman?"" Karen came back into the room. Her eyes were angry. ""Is that what this is about?"" she said in her argument voice. ""I've told you before, Mark and I are just friends. He fixes the things around the house that you never seem to have time for anymore, and he does nice work. That's all."" ""Yeah, I know,"" Joe said sarcastically, ""that's all."" They stared at each other in silence. Finally, Karen spoke up. Her voice was calm and cold. ""I've had it Joe. I've really had it."" He looked up at her from his seat at the table. He knew she meant it. ""Either you get some help, or I'm leaving."" Joe yelled at her. ""Where are you going Karen, to him? Just go ahead!"" With that he pushed his chair back and stood up. Karen stepped to one side. He grabbed his car keys off of the hook and headed for the door. ""I'm going out,"" he said and slammed the door behind him. * * * The bartender looked at Joe from the other end of the bar and tapped his wristwatch. Joe looked at the clock over the bar. It was closing time, and Joe had been sitting there since nine. He fished through his wallet and threw a twenty dollar bill on the bar. He staggered slightly as he found his way to the door and out into the parking light. The night was cool and clear, and it felt good after the stale air of the bar. The plan had come to Joe during his third beer. It was perfect. It would be hard for Karen to run off with Mark Fisher if there was no Mark Fisher. What if he were plucked a little early from the tree of life? Joe smiled inwardly at his private joke. It was time to buy some apples. It took him two tries, but Joe finally got the car door open. The combination of the booze and his new plan made him feel strangely energized. He eased the car out of the parking lot and set out towards Route 24. After a while, he saw the glow of lights up ahead on the side of the road. He was in luck, Cain's was open. Joe parked clumsily and left his lights on. He got out of his car and shuffled over to the stand. The bright lights stung his eyes, and he could hear the ping ping sound of insects bouncing off of the aluminum shades. ""Cain!"" Joe called out loudly. ""Cain!"" Joe was swaying slightly. Cain appeared out of the shadows in the back of the stand. ""I'm here mister, no need to shout."" His eyes reflected the light strangely. ""What can I do for you?"" ""You know,"" Joe said with menace. ""You know. I want the apples."" Cain looked at him with a question on his face. ""What apples?"" ""Don't play stupid with me,"" Joe growled and grabbed the old man by the straps of his overalls. ""I want some Mark Fishers!"" Cain looked confused. ""Mark Fishers? I don't have any Mark Fishers"" ""The hell you don't,"" Joe yelled, and pushed the old man hard against the side of the shed. ""Listen,"" Joe said through clenched teeth. ""You sold me some apples you called Larry Millers. I ate them, and Larry Miller dies."" Cain was staring wide-eyed at Joe. ""Then I bought some Fred Kimballs. I threw them into traffic, and poof, Fred's pushing up daisies."" Joe paused to see if his words were having an effect. Cain looked frightened, but he was listening. ""And now I've got another problem, and you're going to help me solve it."" Joe tightened his hands on the old man's suspenders and slammed him against the wall again. ""Now, where are the Mark Fishers?"" Cain shook his head and was gasping for air. ""You don't understand,"" he said between breaths, ""you've got it all wrong."" ""How's that?"" Joe asked suspiciously. ""I said you've got it all wrong."" Cain had his wind back by now. ""I don't get to choose which apples to sell, I just pick the ones that are ripe. Larry Miller and Fred Kimball were ripe. Their time was up."" Joe stood there with his mouth open trying to digest what he had just heard. ""Let me get this straight,"" he said, letting go of Cain's suspenders. ""You don't choose the apples? Those two died of natural causes?"" Cain was nodding. ""Yep, in their cases anyway. The apples are just our way of timing things. We never sell them before they're ripe."" Joe stared at the tubs of apples around him. ""And all of these are,"" he swallowed hard, ""people?"" ""Oh my, good gracious no,"" Cain laughed heartily. ""We only get one or two ripe batches a day. The rest of these are for display purposes only."" He winked slyly. ""Well, what are you doing open now if you only get one or two batches a day?"" Joe asked with genuine interest. ""To tell you the truth, I was getting ready to close down when I saw you pull up,"" Cain answered. ""I just sold my last batch to a real nice fellow a couple of minutes before you got here. They were a young variety. Real pretty, fragrant too."" Joe's vision was blurry and he felt wobbly on his feet. He reached out for the wall to support himself. ""Funny thing about them, though,"" Cain continued. ""Every single one of them was rotten at the core."" Cain's blue eyes were fixed on the sagging figure in front of him. ""We call them Joe Johnsons,"" Cain said with a smile, and disappeared into the darkness. ",candidate00003
6,00001,unknown,"It was her snoring that woke him. A gravely, deep, rasping snore, followed by a rushing wind of exhalation, followed by a slight smacking of lips as the process prepared to repeat itself. Harry looked at the glowing orange face of his alarm clock and tried to focus his eyes. It read 12:45. ""At least she's consistent,"" he thought, and started to yawn when he heard her mumbling. ""Wahto. Mmm. Nomm."" Without turning over, Harry reached over and shook her shoulder. ""Gladys. Wake up. You're dreaming,"" he said, more to the pillow than to his wife. ""Mmm hmmm,"" Gladys mumbled and rolled over on her side, taking most of the covers with her. Harry sighed and looked at the clock again. 12:47. He had to get up for work at six. She began to mumble again. ""Tanto. Biscay. Earm."" ""Gladys,"" Harry said with some exasperation. ""Gladys, stop mumbling and go to sleep."" She wheezed something else, then started to snore again. Harry shut his eyes tightly and pulled the pillow over his head. It was going to be a long night. When the alarm clock buzzed at six o'clock, Harry fumbled in the dark to turn it off. Gladys did not stir. ""At least she's quiet,"" Harry thought. He lay there in the dark for a moment, then sat up, carefully pulled back the covers, and got out of bed. He was dressed and eating his Danish in the kitchen by the time she began stirring in the bedroom. He heard a wet cough, then smelled the smoke from her morning cigarette. ""You're still here?"" Gladys said out of the side of her mouth as she walked into the kitchen. Her nightgown had a coffee stain on it. ""And good morning to you too,"" Harry replied and went back to his Danish. Gladys poured herself a cup of coffee and stood by the sink. She took a slow drag from her cigarette and exhaled. ""You were talking in your sleep again last night,"" Harry said. ""Did you have a bad dream?"" ""Was I?"" she asked. ""I don't remember."" ""I couldn't understand what you were saying, but it sounded like you were talking to someone."" He dunked his Danish in his coffee and took a bite. ""Well, I wasn't."" She took another slow drag from her cigarette. Harry hoped she would flick off the long ash before it fell onto the floor. ""When are you coming home tonight?"" ""I'll be a little late again,"" Harry said. ""Bob and I have to finish running through the numbers on the project."" She flicked her ashes into the sink. ""You're going to have to get your own dinner. Ruby and I are going bowling."" Harry knew what that meant. Gladys would stumble home at two in the morning, sloppy drunk. Another night's sleep shot to hell. ""What's the matter, Harry?"" Gladys asked, and lit another cigarette. ""You forget how to cook?"" ""No,"" he said to his coffee cup. ""I'm sure I'll figure out something."" ""Damn right you will. And don't go leaving the dishes in the dishwasher for me to put away tomorrow, either."" Harry finished his Danish and made a show of looking at his watch. ""I've got to go,"" he said, and stood up and put his cup on the counter next to the sink. ""We'll see you tonight,"" he said, and grabbed his briefcase. Gladys exhaled a long stream of smoke from the side of her mouth. ""We'll see you tonight Gladys,"" he said again, more to himself, and walked out the door. Harry thought that the drive to work went more quickly than normal. He almost drove past the life-sized bronze satellite that marked the main entrance to the parking lot. Even after 14 years with the company, Harry still didn't know much about satellites and telecommunications. But, he did know they were expensive. And that made accountants like him almost as important as the scientists and engineers. The thought made him smile. Harry found Bob working on Mr. Pearson's travel receipts. The exertion had caused a slight sheen of perspiration to form on Bob's balding head. ""Morning Bob,"" Harry said and placed a thick folder on his desk. ""That's the initial budgeting work on Project Marconi."" ""Shhh!"" Bob said, then looked around to see who was listening. He put the file in his top desk drawer without opening it. ""Well, aren't you even going to look at it?"" Harry asked. Bob replied in a low voice. ""Orders from Mr. Pearson. The boys in R and D are really onto something this time."" ""I read the project description,"" Harry said in an even lower voice than Bob's. ""Do you think there's anything to it? I mean, do you think they really heard something?"" Bob suddenly sat up and began to straighten out some papers on his desk. Harry took the hint and picked up his briefcase. The morning work teams were beginning to filter in. ""Uh, do you still want to go over those figures?"" Harry asked. Bob pointed to a note on his calendar that said ""5 p.m., conference room."" Harry nodded and walked down the hall to his own office. At 5 p.m., Mr. Pearson introduced Dr. Weinberg who cleared his throat and wrote the words ""Project Marconi"" on the black board in big block letters. Then he began to chatter excitedly in his high pitched voice while he scrawled equation after equation on the board in front of him. When he finished, he turned to the group. ""Gentlemen?"" he asked. He pushed up his glasses and waited. Mr. Pearson stood up. ""Walter, you know I don't have the technical background to evaluate all of this,"" he said waving his hand at the board. ""But, if you say it can be done, I'm behind you."" Mr. Pearson looked around at the room full of furrowed brows. It seemed to console him. ""Mr. Pearson, I know it can be done,"" Weinberg said in an even higher pitch than usual. ""At least on a small scale."" He waved the chalk in Harry's direction. ""Our volunteers have already transmitted the first test messages."" Mr. Pearson slapped his hand on the table and then shook a finger at his engineers. ""You hear that boys? That's genius talking."" He stood up and pointed at the board, then turned to face the team. ""Clear your schedules gentlemen."" He said it as if he were announcing a race. ""We'll start full-scale tomorrow."" Then he walked out the door. By the time Harry's battered old dodge had pulled into his driveway, he had forgotten all about Gladys's bowling plans. After his work day, he was relieved to find that she wasn't home. He let himself in without bothering to take off his hat, and went straight into the bedroom. He walked up to the headboard and checked the dollar-sized silver disk he had taped behind it. Pulling back the tape, Harry saw that the tiny green light was on and shining steadily. He stared at it for a long time before finally smoothing the tape back into place. Harry was finishing the peas in his TV dinner when he heard the key rattle in the door. He could hear Gladys's muffled swearing. He checked his watch, and smiled. The door flew open with a bang, and Gladys stood swaying in the doorway. ""What are you doing here?"" she asked. Her voice was too loud. ""I'm eating my dinner, Gladys."" ""Oh, what do I care? I'm going out with Ruby."" She dropped her purse onto the couch and put out an arm to steady herself. After a moment, she looked back at the dining room table. ""What are you looking at?"" she said. Harry shook his head and went back to his peas. ""You're not reading another Florida brochure are you?"" ""Well, no, I'm"" ""I told you, we're retiring to Toledo. Margaret's in Toledo."" She reached up and scratched the back of her neck. ""I know your sister's in Toledo,"" Harry answered back. ""I'm just interested in Florida, that's all."" She stumbled past him and down the hallway to the bathroom. Harry could hear her rattling through the cabinet drawers, then he heard the sound of glass breaking. ""Gladys, what are you doing in there?"" He got a grunt in response, and heard the medicine cabinet being opened. ""Gladys!"" ""What?"" ""What are you doing in there?"" She staggered back into the dining room with a bottle of aspirin in her hand. She hadn't fixed her ruffled hair or smeared lipstick. Harry could smell the gin from where he sat. ""My head hurts like hell,"" she said and steadied herself with the back of a chair. She looked at the aspirin bottle in her hand and said ""I need some water."" Her high heels clacked on the linoleum as she wobbled into the kitchen. She turned on the water then turned it off again, and moaned. ""Harry! Damn it Harry call the hospital! My head feels like it's going to burst."" She stood hunched over the sink, holding her head in both of her hands. Harry looked at the clock on the wall. It glowed in the dull orange light that shone in through the window. It read eight o'clock. ""Harry, help me!"" Gladys said and collapsed with a solid thud onto the floor. Harry picked up his TV dinner tray, and walked into the kitchen. He stepped over Gladys's legs, opened the trash can, and dropped the tinfoil tray into it. Gladys groaned softly behind him. ""Don't worry Gladys,"" Harry said gently. ""It's almost time."" He looked out the kitchen window. Orange light flooded the backyard, and he could hear a rhythmic, mechanical hum coming from just beyond the back porch. Harry knelt down beside Gladys and stroked her hair, turning her face towards him. Her mascara had run and left dark streaks on her face. Smeared red lipstick exaggerated her twisted mouth. ""Goodness Gladys, you're a mess. You can't be seen in that state."" Gladys made a weak attempt to push Harry's hands away. Harry fended her off easily, then reached under her chin and jerked off the thin golden chain she was wearing. Gladys gasped then was quiet. He stood up and walked to the kitchen door and opened it. He put his hand in front of his face to shield his eyes from the blinding orange light. The backyard humming grew louder and more urgent. Gladys rolled over onto her knees and struggled to get to her feet. ""Harry, you son of a bitch, what's that noise? What did you do to me?"" The exertion made her pant. Harry turned his head towards her. He looked like a boy about to go to the circus. ""I didn't do anything to you Gladys. They did."" Harry held out Gladys's necklace at arm's length in front of him. The windows of the house began to rattle. He almost had to shout to be heard. ""I taped the transmitter to your headboard. They've been talking to you for over a week now. At night, when you've been sleeping."" Gladys stared with wide eyes at Harry. The blazing orange light seemed to make him glow. A quivering purple tentacle with a circle of delicate pincers at the end came through the kitchen door. It seemed to sniff the air for a moment, then gently took the gold chain out of Harry's hand. A gurgling, squealing noise erupted just outside of his view, and a second tentacle appeared. Harry smiled and pointed to the kitchen. ""Dr. Weinberg asked for volunteers Gladys,"" Harry shouted over the hum and Gladys's screams. Six purple tentacles appeared and dragged Gladys out of the kitchen and into the silver space ship outside. He followed her onto the porch and waved as she disappeared up the shallow boarding ramp. ""Of course, I volunteered you,"" he said, and watched with a smile as the silver space ship ascended into the night.

7,00002,unknown,"The last few words on the page burned like fever. The sculptor read them again and again until they blurred into insensibility. He let the book fall to the floor, and left it where it fell, the soft flapping of closing pages like a balm to his mind, the sudden loss of stimulus a cold compress over his hot eyes. He rubbed them until he saw stars and spoke those last few words out loud. In doing so, he not only confirmed to himself that it could be done, he knew instantly the way to do it. It would not be enough to build the thing of clay alone. He knew that. He had read the lore, of course, had in fact taken much of it with a pinch of salt, but much had touched something in him, something that bypassed his blinding grief. It had to do with hope and belief. It had to do with the fact that so much truth was hidden within the myth, so much that had to be true. It was this he clung to, a raft hopelessly battered upon a sea of nonsense. And then he had found the book. Called simply Earth, Risen it was written anonymously in flowing script onto dark parchment-like paper, in a mixture of Hebrew and English. It was this book that had finally convinced him that it could be done. Are you sure you want to know? the bookseller had asked him. There are some things a man should not be party to, and I believe with all my heart that this is one of them. But the bookseller was as driven by money as anyone else, and he had accepted the payment graciously, holding the sculptor's gaze for perhaps longer than necessary. And so the book had been bought and devoured in the way important books so often are. The book had such a simplicity to it that he knew at once it was genuine. So much of the lore he had studied had been hyperbole, covering up lies and misrepresented fact with drama and shocking revelation. Not so this book. It was, in essence, an instruction manual, a description of the how and why of it. He bent now to retrieve the slim volume, and turned immediately to the last page. and so with truth, and with their own vitality, or substantial part of it, they will live. And when truth dies, as it eventually must, it will be the end of them, and they cannot revive ' And then that last line, as with the bookseller, holding his gaze just that little bit longer than he would have liked. be aware of what you do. Wrath, like love, has to be earned. Be determined which one you truly seek. Because all is possible, and all is truth ' The sculptor stood and the candles set all about him danced as he moved. A soft wind blew about his feet, sending dust motes into frenzied choreography. He poured a large glass of wine, took half of it in one swallow, and set the glass down on a long low bench that flanked one side of the room. In the centre of the room lay a table, high and sturdy. Next to this was a box, an old tea chest, rough hewn planks making up its walls, a hinged lid open to the floor. He reached into the chest, grabbed the neck of the sack within and hefted the load onto the table. A muted clunk broke the silence, and pale dust sifted through the open weave of the sacking. He opened the sack and one by one, lifted out the contents, arranging them roughly, discarding the sack when he was done. The assortment of bones on the table sent a cold shiver through him. They were small and dull and off-white. Dried sinew and tiny shreds of black flesh clung to some of the larger ones; the femur and skull, a shoulder blade. He had bagged hand and foot bones so as to keep them together, and released them now in a clattering pile like druids' rune stones, beginning to arrange the tableau as if it were nothing more than a jigsaw puzzle. He had once studied anatomy and bone structure and human physiology for his sculptures. It was this knowledge he used now to reassemble the skeleton. Some bones were missing , a rib here, vertebra there, lower jaw hopelessly crushed when his shovel had broken through the rotted coffin lid , but it was only a matter of hours before he had something on his table that he recognised. It was an almost complete child's skeleton. He took a battery-powered drill and fitted the smallest bit he could find. It looked no thicker than a toothpick. With whining monotony, sending tiny puffs of foul smelling blue smoke into the air, he set about drilling holes into the ends of each and every bone. He was fastidious, clamping each in steady fingers, blowing gently to send the smoke spiralling away from his eyes. A faint burning smell began to surround him, and he worked on. The bones in the feet were drilled now, and he moved onto the hand, and vertebrae. He used a slightly larger bit to drill the leg and arm bones, and the complex machinery of shoulder blade and ribs and collar bone. The rib cage was almost completely intact, apart from the missing rib, and he set this down on the floor as he worked. As each hour passed, tiny drifts of browning bone dust appeared at the ends of each cluster of bones. His excitement grew as each bone was holed, and he began to relish the sweet burning aroma as drill met bone. The sound became the soundtrack to his work, and when he had finished, the last vertebra drilled and placed back with its brothers, he stood back from the table, unaware that the drill was whining redundantly in his hand. He stayed that way, eyes scanning the skeleton over and over to spot any missed bones, until the battery died and the drill fell silent. He dropped it and kicked it absently away from him. From under the bench, in between sips of steadying wine, he sorted through a jumble of boxes and settled on two. The first contained wire. Yards and yards of hair thin silver wire, wrapped fastidiously with strands of spider silk, so that they shimmered like dull moonlight. It had taken months of painstaking and ultimately painful work to collect the silk from his battery of captive spiders. It had to be spider silk. This was one piece of lore that he truly believed, and the book was specific about it. The second contained a lump of wet clay about the size of a football. It was this he brought to the table now, along with a book detailing human anatomy. His skilled fingers worked quickly to separate a piece of clay and draw it into a rough cylinder, about an inch thick and eight long. With it, in between long consultations with the diagrams in his anatomy book, he fashioned a rough flattened semi circle. He drew each end into a paddle about twice the width of the rest. He moulded the whole into a rounded V, and set it next to the skull for sizing. With further modifications and trimming of excess clay, he fitted the piece exactly to the skull. He had made a jawbone. Satisfied, he removed more clay from its box and set about creating a rib, the missing vertebra. Soon, for he was an accomplished sculptor, he was satisfied. He removed the clay pieces carefully, and walked with them over to his kiln in the far corner. His hands were stained with the clay, calloused and sore from hours of painstaking drilling. He placed the pieces into the kiln, watching for a moment as the haze of fire shimmered around them. The smell of hot clay surrounded him. He washed his hands, and changed clothes, throwing the clay-streaked shirt and jeans into an uncomfortable heap next to the kiln. He allowed himself a short sleep. Hours later, the pieces fired and cooled, he sanded their jagged edges and drilled their ends. They fitted into place perfectly, as he knew they would, and a short frisson of excitement ran through him. The skeleton was complete. He began to thread the silk-wrapped silver wire through each and every holed bone. He snipped each piece to size and loosely twisted their ends together. The purpose of the wire was not for strength. It was not to hold the skeleton together, although he hoped the silk wrapped wire could bear the skeleton's weight for a short time. Rather it was a symbol of completion; a tying together of spirit and bone, locking the loose pieces so that they might know they belong together, and behave accordingly. As sweat ran through the mask of dried clay on his face, his tears joined it, tiny tributaries swelling like a river in a cracked river bed. He wiped the moisture away, smearing the clay like claw marks under his eyes and across his cheeks, red ochre where his finger tips had cracked and added their own moisture. When the final wires between skull and clay jawbone were secured, he moved a second table into place alongside the first. On this he slapped down great chunks of wet clay, relishing the earthy smell, the living quality of the mineral. Fresh spatters of brown water coated him. He fashioned a rough silhouette of a human body, arms and legs and torso about three times their natural width. He pressed a large disc into place where the head should be. He offered up a silent prayer and slipped his hands under the skeleton, one at the knees and the other under the fragile puzzle of vertebrae below the skull. He hefted the wired bones off the table, and had a moments panic when the head lolled comically backwards and the legs clattered towards the floor. The wires held, however, and, its feet kicking in the air, he transferred the skeleton to the second table, laying it lovingly onto the clay silhouette, as a father might lay a sleeping child into bed. Next he filled a large bucket with water and set it next to the skeleton. Immersing his hands in the blessedly cool water, he let them sit there for a while, absently rubbing fingertip against fingertip, scrubbing the blood and grime away. OK, he said softly, and the words echoed around the dusty room. He removed his hands from the bucket and, still dripping, set them about their work bringing the soft clay silhouette up and around the collection of bones. The hollows in the rib cage and between leg and arm bones, he filled with rough blocks of clay. Hours he spent kneading and moulding and knitting edges, filling gaps, adding here, taking away there. He gently turned the body over, and began to work on the back, cleverly shaping the muscles in the back and neck, rounding the clay at the back of the skull, remembering the tiny flat spot just above the nape that he loved. Turning again, he set the body down, heavy now, its heft just right, the still wet clay falling as it should, legs turning slightly out, hands resting palm up. He worked on them now, separating fingers, moulding knuckles and joints, carving delicate lines and creases. Toe and fingernails were shaped, the minute curls of excess clay from his knife falling around his feet. The body he roughed into shape, content to have the idea of it just right, but the detail he forewent in favour of the tiny outfit of clothes hanging from the door. These he would dress the body in once dry. At last he could do no more, and sat back heavily, the table and its body lying at face height. He gasped at its likeness, despite the blank face. He ran a hand across its chest, cupped the narrow chin, and with a fingernail, described a rough mouth, and position of the eyes. He teased a rough pyramid of clay from the middle of the face and shaped absently into its nose. He could do no more and fell back, exhausted. From his jeans pocket he drew a picture. Its edges were torn and crumpled but the face staring from it was crisp and clear. His boy. He slept where he had fallen, the clay on his hands drying to pale ochre dust, the body above him hardening slightly in the dry air. He dreamt no dreams save for the face of the boy, and the sound of screaming. It seemed when he woke that he had been gripped by fever anew. He rose and almost instantly started his work, as early morning arrived without acknowledgement. With an array of shaping and cutting tools, he set about the body's face. With memory alone he teased and shaped and moulded. The nose that he had roughed out the night before became exact, the small bump on its bridge so lifelike he bent to kiss it as he had so many years before. He worked tirelessly, cupping the shape of cheeks with his moistened palms, creating tiny flaps of clay that he pressed into place over eyes that stared into his with uncanny reason. He went as far as to scratch tiny lines at the corner of the eyes, extracting signs of life almost absently. The tiny full mouth; pointed chin with its smooth dimple; high, full forehead. All these features became reality in his hands. With strands of clay rolled into straw thicknesses, he began layering the dome of skull with hair, each layer subjected to a barber's scrutiny to ensure that the strands lay just right. He created the flick of fringe that half covered one eye, and turning the body carefully, let the longer strands at the back just reach to the body's shoulders. He looked at the face, and with a calculated flick, opened the mouth like a wound; remoulded the lips and added the impression of teeth within. Stepping back from the visage, he let out a coughing cry, hands covering the lower half of his own face, muting his shock. He reached to remould the ear lobes, but let the knife fall, content. It was perfect. His son lay on the table before him, androgynous from the neck down, but utterly right and beautiful above. The sculptor spoke his name over and over, and his sobbing words grew slowly quieter, and night fell once more. As the sun burned away a ground mist, and a sweet smelling breeze blew in through the recently opened door, he dressed the figure quickly, allowing the soft folds of cloth to mask any imperfections in the moulding of the body. He had slept well, and changed into clean jeans and a shirt. He rescued the book from the floor and smoothed the pages. Almost subliminal in their placing, the symbols he had searched for were in the middle of the book, scratched with faded ink into one margin; one truth, one death. To mark his son with the first would bring life. The second would end it. He had practiced their curling form over and over, until he could draw them in his sleep. He swallowed the dregs of his third coffee that morning and held his shaking hands up to his face. With a huge effort, he willed them to calm, and they did. The father became the sculptor then, all thoughts erased except for that of rendering the symbols perfectly. He turned once more to his clay son, smoothed the hair as if it were living, feeling and hearing the soft rasp of dry clay under his fingertips. It wasn't until he saw the first drop of moisture on the face, sinking like rain on a cracked river bed, that he realised he was crying. He selected a knife from his tools, and laid an elbow next to the face, cupping the hand holding the knife with his other. He breathed deeply and held it. When all sound had ceased, when all he could sense was the slight pressure and throb of blood in his ears, he lowered the knife to the forehead and watched, as if he were a mere observer, as the tip scratched into the clay. ?O? Truth. The symbols came easily. Indeed, they seemed to form themselves, the knife cutting into the clay like it was fresh and soft. Tiny parings muddied the edges, and he blew on these absently. It was done. The last thing was to feed them. His blood was the only choice, obviously, and so he used the same knife, heedless to the clay-soiled tip, to part his skin on the tip of his thumb. Seconds passed until blood welled into the cut, spilling silently. His mind still blank other than thought of his task, he pressed the wound onto the symbol on his son's forehead. He felt pain then, almost a sucking sensation as the dry clay eagerly sought his fluids. It happened very quickly. A slight hum filled his ears, the sound of electricity perhaps, and he felt a thrumming under his hand, still pressed to his son. He lifted his hand quickly, and stepped back from the body, rigidly upright, eyes wide with shock. He had known it would work, prayed for it, and yet now he was chilled to the bone with fear. A finger curled. The cloth of the figure's clothes shifted and settled. The sculptor moved nearer, clutching the knife tightly, breath rasping faster and faster, nostrils flared. An eye opened, the sound like one stone scratching across another. Another eye. The perfectly rendered eyes, complete except for colour (why hadn't he thought to add colour?), turned and moved and rolled in their sockets. They found him suddenly, fixed on him, blinked slowly, and stared. The sculptor let out a cry, fell to his knees, and moaned his son's name. The body sat up on the table, dried clay falling from it like leaves, as if they had been playing in an autumn garden. The mouth opened, and impossibly, almost silent, but not silent, it breathed. It reached to him, flexing its fingers, working them like it was trying on new gloves. It smacked its lips silently, discovering the configurations of its face, learning movement and sound and form, even as it shifted its bulk to the edge of the table. A further icicle of fear pierced the sculptor's spine as the boy raised one hand and made a fist. Slowly, exerting utmost control, it extended one finger and pointed to him. daddy? came a scratching question. The body shifted nearer the edge of the table, until gravity took hold. With no knowledge of balance or of the mechanisms needed to stand, the body pitched helplessly onto the floor and lay; a soft mewling sound broke the stillness. The sculptor moved quickly to its side, all fear gone. He moaned the boy's name over and over, convinced he would find the body hopelessly broken. But whatever magic had brought tragic life to his sculpture, it seemed also to have brought a physical sturdiness, for even as he reached the body, it was pushing itself into a sitting position, limbs and face and body intact. daddy it said again, confident this time, its voice still no more than a scraping whisper. The sculptor reached his hands to cup the boy's cheeks, chilled anew at the pulsing warmth beneath the clay. He pushed the fear aside, closed his eyes and bent to plant a kiss on the boy's forehead. If he had expected the kiss to land on soft, pliant skin, perfumed with fresh air and the exertion of play, then the reality could not have come as more of a shock. Gritty powder coated his lips, and he tasted the alkalinity of clay, the earthiness of the boy's flesh. He moaned again. The boy moaned with him, a helpless wa wa wa wa wa and the sculptor ran his hands across the waving hair, so lifelike to touch, but smelling like the earth it was. He kissed him again, this time knowing the feeling and so relishing it. His son, born again. As he drew closer, folded his arms about the boy, the sounds he was issuing suddenly became clearer. wa wa w .w wh wh why? why? why? why? why? The sculptor sat back, unable to think as the boy repeated his desperate question again and again. In all his planning, years and years of searching, never had he thought that this would be the first question the boy would ask. Tears streamed down his face, and as he reached out, the boy backed off, shedding dust and clay particles as he went, backing up, backing up until he reached a wall. He continued to push with his legs and in doing so, learned the mechanism of standing. The sculptor stood with him, and moved to stand in front of him, imploring the boy with eyes and gestures and words, to come to him, to let himself be held and to be a son again. The boy's eyes flickered around the room, landing on the sculptor's face, the table, the chairs, the window, the open door, the open door the open door the open door Before the sculptor could gather his wits, before he had chance to move, the boy pushed roughly past him, knocking him aside, and crashed through the open door, morning sunlight highlighting the contours of his exquisite face. The sculptor let out a shout of fear and confusion, but ultimately he was too late. The boy had gone. Time passed of which the sculptor had no recollection. The air seemed muted and grey, sounds muffled. Indeed solace could only be found in darkness and in such a state of drunkenness that he felt nothing but the burn of cheap wine. Even the hollow pain in his chest seemed diminished. For a time after his creation had fled, he had raged, hurling tools and lumps of sodden clay about the room, erasing any sign of his work, erasing any sign of the loss he had faced twice now. His son. His poor son. Panic fluttered constantly at the edge of his mind, his hands shook, and sounds issued from his ragged throat that bore no resemblance to human noises. What have I done? he cried to the room. My son! He began to piece together anything that might help him find the boy. He read and re-read Earth, Risen, hoping, desperately searching for some nugget he had missed. Where might he have gone? Who may have found him? And all this was affording the sculpture sentient thought. What if it was mindless, nothing more than animated clay? What if there was none of his son left? But the first word from its mouth had been daddy. Surely it must be his son. It must be. He took a drink of wine then, and one followed, and followed. Bottle after bottle was consumed, and the sculptor began to dream that none of it had happened. Darkness turned darker, sound failed him, and he lost his fight with sleep. But even sleep could not protect him from images of moving clay, great lumpen faces with stretched maws, grasping hands, tearing, pulling. And always the questions. why why why why why why why why why? He woke screaming. be aware of what you do. Wrath, like love, has to be earned. Be determined which one you truly seek. Because all is possible, and all is truth ' Was it love he wanted, truly? Or was he really seeking the boy's wrath? He closed his eyes and saw the boy's face, heard screaming, heard the breaking of glass and shrieking of tyres. He lived the moment that his son died, over and over. Died because of him. Because he took the boy from his mother in a drunken rage, drove in a drunken rage, killed his son in a drunken rage. He read the words again. In a second he knew. Knew everything. He knew somewhere in the back of his mind that he could never have lived with the sculpture like he would have his own son. And so love was not his aim here. That left only wrath, and as soon as he thought it, he felt a great weight lift. At last he felt the burden of his son's death lift from his shoulders, and he knew where to find him. The door stood open still, flecks of clay marring the surface. It was a short walk to the bridge. The place where he had driven from the road, plunged the car into the icy river. To this day, he could not have said it was truly an accident or truly deliberate. But it happened, and as the black water flooded the car, and he struggled with his own seatbelt, he heard his son screaming and screaming. Until water smothered them both. He lived. His son did not, and now as he approached the small bridge, the replacement railing that his car had destroyed still a shade lighter than the original all these years on, he saw the figure sitting on the wooden boards. It had lost its clothes, and he saw again how unfinished its body was. A mere suggestion of form, and yet hands as perfect as in life covered a face that he knew better than his own. It sobbed as it sat there, whispers of pain and sadness reaching the sculptor's ears. He bent to it and rested a hand on its shoulders. It reacted violently, snatching itself away, its mouth open in a silent scream, a suggestion of fear in its eyes. It locked gaze with him, and in a heart lifting moment, its mouth curled in a smile. Faint and stiff as the clay had dried but it was there. daddy it said. my son, he replied holding his arms out wide. It came to him then, and wrapped its arms around him. He sobbed and sobbed, tears dappling the dome of its head, running along the cleft of its parted hair. He dropped to his knees, knowing what was to come, and yet feeling nothing but the joy of finding his boy. He smiled and kissed the face lightly. He picked the boy up, rested his weight on the railings above the roiling water. It was as black as he remembered. Reaching a hand up to the creature's forehead, he whispered two words onto its tiny ear. i'm sorry Its grip on him tightened and its eyes widened slightly as it realised somehow what he was about to do. He rested a thumb on its forehead, and with a scratching stroke, scraped out the first symbol drawn there. He remembered the text from Earth, Risen, remembered the symbols perfectly. In scratching out that first, he effectively turned truth, into death, The transformation happened quickly. Suddenly the sculpture was just that. In its eyes, there was nothing. He looked down into its face and saw not life there, but only the numerous faint marks of the tools that he had used to render it. The body was a dead weight, and its arms a hardened clay sculpture around his middle. As it dropped and he had neither the strength nor the desire to stop its fall, it took him with it. The water hit him with a slap of iciness, and he didn't hesitate to finish what he had started. His first breath was air and foamy water and he coughed it out reflexively. His next, and the next, and the next, were not air. It was black freezing water he was filling his lungs with now, and he welcomed it. His son would have breathed the same water, would have felt the same panic, the pain in his chest that was fading remarkably quickly now he had resigned to it. As darkness came over him, he felt the clay sculpture begin to disintegrate in his hands. Faintly he felt the scrape of its hands as it released him into the water, and he reached with the last of his strength and wit to catch hold of its face. Clay crumbled under his touch, and he brought his hand back and kissed the residues. The action of the water gave the face a lopsided grin, one he remembered so well, and his tears added infinitesimal volume to the raging river. The pain was gone. His sight and hearing were gone. There was no feeling as the current tore him this way and that, scraped his trailing legs along the river bed, tore into his flesh with loose rock and branch. There was just the feeling of floating and the heart-bursting joy as a small hand took his and a whisper of love from a small voice echoed in his ear. He was content to lose his life for this; as if he had sculpted love from the very bones of despair and guilt. To have that hand in his, and those whispers of love and forgiveness in his ear. To have those, without life? It was enough. ",candidate00002
8,00003,unknown,"""Fire!"" yelled Jimmy and hoped that that would empty the classroom and get him out of the test. No dice. Instead his mean old teacher gave him her standard mean old look which meant that he'd be going to the principal's office one more time this week. ""Dang,"" Jimmy thought as he looked up at the clock, ""I thought for sure that'd work."" But it didn't, and it was now a certainty that Jimmy would have to take the test, a test he knew for sure he was going to fail. Not that failure bothered Jimmy. In fact, he didn't mind it one bit. ""How can you ever try anything new if you can't just try it out?"" Jimmy would say with cheerful exuberance, not mindful at all of the fact that his thoughts didn't quite makes sense to all of the adults around him. Jimmy sat and thought for a minute about what his options were. He knew he'd have to take the test. He knew he'd fail, because he hadn't studied, and he didn't care about geography anyway. So, he decided that he'd try to make the best of it and spent the entire 20 minutes drawing an elaborate picture of a rocket ship blasting off for the moon. ""Time's up,"" Mrs. Fitzhugh barked, ""please put down your pencils and turn your papers over."" Jimmy kept on drawing, looking very serious as he put the finishing touches on the star and ""J"" that graced the side of his rocket ship. ""Jimmy,"" said Mrs. Fitzhugh, ""that means you, too."" Jimmy looked up with a grin of satisfaction. He had finished his drawing and he thought it was a good one. ""Please pass your papers to the front,"" Mrs. Fitzhugh directed. Jimmy admired his work one last time, and passed it forward. After he had turned it in, Jimmy faintly remembered that it was supposed to be a geography test. Mrs. Fitzhugh collected the papers from his row. She flipped through the stack and then frowned. ""Jimmy,"" Mrs. Fitzhugh said in her mean old voice, ""I want to see you after class."" ""Dang,"" thought Jimmy ""I must have the meanest teacher in the whole school."" He furrowed his brow in contemplation of the evils that awaited him in that meeting. It was either going to be writing sentences on the blackboard or staying after and cleaning up all the desks in the classroom. Jimmy couldn't decide which was worse. In the end, he decided that cleaning up the desks would be better. Sometimes Tommy Pearson drew funny pictures of Mrs. Fitzhugh on his desk, and Jimmy could at least take a peek at them before he cleaned them off. The rest of the afternoon was slow agony for Jimmy. He tried to keep himself busy by paying special attention to his long division problems, but it wasn't working. It seemed like every time he looked up from his desk, Mrs. Fitzhugh was glaring at him. ""Dang,"" Jimmy murmured to himself, ""she's gonna tell Mom for sure."" At 2:30 the bell finally rang. Mrs. Fitzhugh stood in front of the desks and supervised the cleanup of the day's lessons. ""Put your workbooks inside your desks children,"" she said , then reminded Elizabeth not to forget her sweater like she did yesterday. Jimmy thought she had forgotten about him, but then she looked straight at him. ""Jimmy Peterson, you stay here."" Her voice was loud enough for all the kids to hear. ""The rest of you may go home now."" Mrs. Fitzhugh waited until the room was empty then told Jimmy to come to her desk. ""Just what am I supposed to do with you young man?"" she asked. ""You are just about the laziest, slowest boy I've ever laid eyes on."" Jimmy looked down at the floor tiles. He began to imagine playing a giant checkers game, with him as a red piece. The loud voice of Mrs. Fitzhugh tore him away from his little daydream. ""You listen to me when I talk to you Jimmy Peterson,"" Mrs. Fitzhugh fairly screamed. Jimmy looked her in the eye. Then he pointed one finger at her and stamped his left foot three times. Mrs. Fitzhugh started out from behind her desk. She had had enough, and was going to grab Jimmy's ear and give it a good twist. Just before she could get to him, Jimmy closed his eyes and recited his magic words: ""Shalumum, balamum, bipsumum, palamum."" When Jimmy opened his eyes, Mrs. Fitzhugh was standing there with the meanest old look ever. Then she turned and scurried off into a gap between the bookshelves. Jimmy had to giggle, because even as a mouse, she still looked a little like Mrs. Fitzhugh. ""Dang,"" thought Jimmy. ""I was hoping for a rabbit."" ""Oh well,"" he said to himself as he walked out the door, ""how can you ever try anything new if you can't just try it out?"" ",candidate00003
9,00004,unknown,"It was a warm day out there and he wanted to throw the ball around for a while, which really meant that he wanted to practice his pitches and then spend an hour making fun of how she couldn't throw the balls back to him. He loved to point out that she wasn't holding the baseball cor- rectly. That she wasn't letting her wrist do the work. That she better hope her life never depended on throwing a fastball because if that was the case, well, sugar pie, you should pack it in now. Allie put up with Preston's critiques as she always did: she employed her best ah, shucks shrugs and pathetic little half-smiles that said she was trying to be a good sport but she was, after all, just a girl. At twenty-eight, she couldn't count herself as much of a girl anymore, but she liked the way Preston treated her as if she were one, the way he did things for her in public, like order her meals or recommend which dress she should buy, and the way he held her in his strong arms and told her not to worry her little head over anything. Sometimes late at night, she watched him sleep. He snored most nights and that kept her awake but that wasn't all of it. She liked to watch him sleep, his mouth half open, head tilted back against the pillow so his Adam's apple protruded out. Sometimes she touched him, though never enough to wake him. Not unless she wanted his sex and occasion- ally she did. He wanted her more often and she never refused him, only hoped he wouldn't be too rough about it. During those quiet late-night hours when he snored and she stared, she allowed herself to think about what her friend Gretta said. About getting out and getting away. She wouldn't entertain those ideas during daytime as if Preston might see the thoughts on her face. Only at night when he couldn't see her. That was when it was safe to imagine what life could be like. What life might be for a woman who didn't have to wear long sleeves in July to cover the finger-shaped bruises on her arms. What it would be like to go into the bathroom and not fear that the urine would be dark brown. She wasn't stupid. She knew Preston was a mean asshole sometimes. He had abused her, yes, she could acknowledge that. He had a tend- ency to get too rough with her and often his touch hurt, but he always took care of her afterwards. Always got the ice pack or drew a warm bath for her. He never seriously hurt her. Never broke any bones and the few cuts had been superficial. ""I know, I know,"" she said to Gretta more times than she could re- member. They spoke on the phone when Preston was at the batting cages. ""I will help you get away from him. We'll create some kind of plan to mislead him or something. He's a prick and an abuser and you need to leave him."" This conversation with only slight variation had happened many times. Gretta played her part as the concerned best friend and Allie al- ways assured Gretta that she knew she had to leave and she would one day but it wasn't time yet. ""Then when?"" Gretta said. ""When the coroner takes you away?"" ""That's a bit dramatic,"" Allie said. ""Preston has anger problems but he's not a killer."" ""I'm not saying he's going to slice your throat, but he might go too far some night. I know how he gets. Like he's in a trance."" ""That was one time."" Gretta made an exasperated noise. ""I know it wasn't just one time and that's besides the point. One time is enough."" Gretta was talking about the Thanksgiving episode, as Allie had come to think of it. Gretta didn't know, but clearly sensed, that the one-time- only Thanksgiving incident had happened more than just that one time. In fact, it had come again in various forms at least three more times. Luckily, no one else had been around to witness. ""I'm not in danger,"" Allie said. She told herself the same thing during the night while she stared at his Adam's apple. ""It was like he was fucking possessed,"" Gretta said, still stuck on Thanksgiving. ""Everything is fine."" Gretta didn't say anything for several seconds and Allie hoped that meant she was moving on to another topic. ""When's the last time he hit you?"" ""Gretta, please."" ""He may not have been a football player but he outweighs you by at least sixty pounds so don't tell me his hits don't hurt. You still look like you're waiting for your breasts to mature."" ""Thanks."" ""You should say thanks. Better to be a little thing like you then have these double D's like me. And the double-sized ass to boot."" ""I look like a boy,"" Allie said. ""Preston tell you that, too?"" ""Let it go, please."" ""I will help you get away. He'll never find you."" ""He's not some crazed stalker. If I want to leave, he's not going to come after me."" ""You think so, huh?"" She let the question hang there a moment. ""Wouldn't that mean he loves me? He wouldn't just turn away if I tried to leave."" ""Shit, girl,"" Gretta said. ""You're fucked in the head."" ""Thanks."" ""And one of these days you're going to end up in a hospital and that's when all your bullshit excuses get pushed aside and I take over. I'll have the cops all over him and slam his ass in jail so fast he won't know what the hell happened."" ""That's very sweet of you."" ""That's me,"" Gretta said. ""A real sweetheart."" Gretta was a good friend, had been for most of Allie's life, but she didn't understand everything like she thought she did. Preston had a temper, that was unarguable, but he could be such a sweet guy, had been so charming and gentle for a long time when they first got together. He had problems, sure hell, who didn't? but that didn't mean she should just throw him back into the sea and cast out her bachelorette fishing pole again. Relationships were about commitment. That's what Mom always said. And Allie wasn't in denial. She knew the reasons women stayed in dangerous relationships. Gretta had given her many pamphlets since the Thanksgiving incident, forwarded her too many sad-sop e-mails about abused women and all the programs available to help them. Allie knew all the reasons and had gone through them painstakingly. She thought about each one long and hard and concluded that while her rela- tionship with Preston might not be the most healthy or well-balanced, she wasn't one of those women telling people that she had tripped over her own feet and smacked her head into a doorknob. If that were the case, she would leave. No question. Preston had put on his blue and orange Buffalo Bisons jersey with the stupid picture on the shoulder of the buffalo charging out of a baseball. Preston had once been a very promising pitcher for the minor league team. Might have been quite the pro. Allie had met him at a bar follow- ing a night game in Buffalo. She had gone up there to visit her friend Nicole. Nicole had gotten free tickets from work and said she knew where most of the players went for drinks afterward. It was a loud and bright sports bar with a million televisions hanging off the walls. The players had changed out of their uniforms but they stuck out from the other men with their broad shoulders and muscular arms. Not to mention how they were congratulating each other on whatever great plays had occurred during the game. Allie liked baseball and had enjoyed the game, but it had been an opportunity to get some sun and watch fit men in tight pants. She didn't really know what had happened in the game other than the Bisons beating the Louisville Bats. She and Nicole had changed in the car out of shorts and tank tops into jeans and black silky tops that kind of made her feel a bit like a whore but, she had to admit, she looked good. Preston noticed her right away. Somebody was talking to him but he was staring at her from across the bar, like she had telepathically said hi. She did her best coy routine of glance and look away and smile just enough but not all big and stupid and he raised his glass to her at one point and she laughed even though she really had no idea what to think. A minute later, he was crossing the bar with two beers and she made sure to touch his arm when she took the offered beer. His smile was wide and adorable, a little boy who only wanted to please. She still saw that smile and it always brought her back to that first night when everything seemed to click, like finding him that night was destiny. Preston dropped the bucket of baseballs on the small pitcher's mound and it tipped over, rolling a handful of balls onto the lawn. He cursed but made no effort to clean any of them up. He tossed her the pink baseball glove he had bought her for their one-year anniversary. In gold cursive lettering across the back it read: Allie Eckert. Her last name was Moss. His was Eckert. He was trying to be sweet. Gretta said he was a selfish prick, but Allie came to think of the personalized glove as proof of his love and devotion to her. Baseball meant so much to him and he wanted to share that joy with her, which meant he also loved her. Preston had landscaped his backyard so it resembled a baseball field. He even had a scoreboard that he could operate from a wireless control- ler. Above the HOME and VISITOR score spots hung a custom made sign reading PITCHER'S ALLY. The first time he brought her here, she thought he had made the sign for her but after she pointed out the name coincidence, he said he might have to change it if she couldn't throw for shit. He laughed, said he was joking, and she laughed too. There was a home plate, a pitcher's mound, and a fence a ways bey- ond that. This was not a place to actually play baseball. When some of his former baseball buddies came over, it was always a game of strike outs vs. home runs. She would be in the woods past the fence gathering the home runs. It didn't bother her. It was nice to be included. She took her place behind home plate. It was an actual plate used at Coca-Cola Field. The players had given it to him when he left. They had signed it and Preston had covered it with a thick sheet of glass so even now, almost two years later, the names were still potent in bright blue and black ink. Most of his former teammates had written things like Good Luck and Sorry to See You Go or You Were the Best, but some- body had written, Stop Touching Yourself You Ballsucker and signed it Big Blow. She never asked him about it, but she sometimes wondered what it would feel like to call Preston a ballsucker. Then she immediately felt sorry and scolded herself for being so ungrateful. ""Heads up!"" Allie raised her head in time to jump out of the way from a fastball that would have hit her in the chest. The ball bounced off the large wall behind her on which someone had painted the image of a crouching catcher in full gear and a skinny player in pinstripes forever at bat and never swinging. ""Jesus, Allie. You might want to try to catch the ball."" She shrugged as she always did when she failed to do something right and said she was sorry. ""Don't apologize. Just be ready."" She nodded. ""Are you ready?"" She started to say she was and then she crouched behind home plate and used both hands to ready herself for the pitch. She had once men- tioned getting one of those helmets with the face masks like the players wore and even the protective chest gear but he told her it wasn't neces- sary. He didn't throw wild pitches and as long as she wasn't retarded, she could catch them without all that shit. Besides, she needed to keep her focus on the ball and a face mask would make that more difficult. Allie punched the inside of her glove clumsily. ""All set,"" she said. Preston nodded and grabbed a ball from spilled pile, examined it, rubbed it on his jersey, placed it in his glove and fiddled with it for a little while (Stop Touching Yourself). He leaned forward with his eyes on her as if waiting for a signal she had learned the hard way that he was not waiting for anything from her and then stood, glanced behind him at the distant fence and scoreboard. This part of the routine could take a minute or more depending on his mood, but the rest always happened quickly. His left leg came up, the right arm cocked behind his head, and then his body twisted forward as his right arm whipped around and his back leg kicked up behind him. Less than a blink later, the ball was upon her. Sometimes it landed it her glove. Occasionally it hit her, though nev- er in the head. This time it smacked into the middle of her glove with the familiar thwap! Preston made a fist and pumped his arm a few times. ""Strike!"" he called. Her palm stung and her fingers would soon be numb but it wasn't really that bad. Sometimes it could even be fun. ""Good one, babe,"" she said. ""Fucking-A,"" he said. He would spend the next minute or so rotating his throwing arm at his side or flapping it like an injured bird trying desperately to use its only good wing. He said it was necessary to stay loose. She had learned not to giggle at the ridiculousness of it. The whole thing was kind of silly. He was never going to be a professional. He had said so himself. She took the ball from her glove and set it on the grass next to the bat- ter's box. It was important to not get it dirty. He didn't want her throw- ing them back to him, either. She had done that a few times but Preston had gotten tired of coming off the mound to catch her throws that al- ways, no matter what she did, fell short. When she had tried to throw with her whole body like he did, she threw the ball way off to her right, a shanked golf ball. She would throw them back to him but not until later when he was ready to laugh. ""Christ, Allie, you ready?"" She had been looking at the signatures again. She nodded. I'm ready, you ballsucker. The thought was barely articulated before a wave of re- gret washed over her and she wanted to apologize but then Preston's leg was up and his arm was swinging forward and there was the little white baseball with the red stitching rocketing right for her seeming to get faster and faster as it sliced the air and she had to drop to the ground with the glove in front of her face. The ball crashed against the backboard and rebounded to smack her in the back. ""Holy, Christ, Allie, you have an epileptic fit?"" She got up, dusted herself off. ""Sorry,"" she said. He shook his head, loosened up his shoulder. She got back behind the plate. This might not be as fun as an easy-going back-and-forth catch, but it wasn't that bad, either. She just felt a little off today. There were days when she didn't feel quite right, like her sense of balance was off or something. It could get bad sometimes, feel like she was on the deck of a ship trapped on choppy seas. It could make her vomit and bring on mi- graines. Preston would take care of her, however. He was good for that. She just had to get through his pitches and then she could collapse and let him tend to her. She had been to the doctor, even had an MRI that Preston said was unnecessary and actually was because there was noth- ing physically wrong with her. The doctor suggested she see a therapist. Preston told her in the car that if she wanted to see a therapist she could pack her fucking bags right now because no girlfriend of his was going to be known as a cooky fuck. Besides, he assured her, he would help her through this. He would be all she needed. She only had to trust that he knew best. The smile that punctuated that promise was the same one that first tugged at her heart at the sports bar in Buffalo. It always made everything better. He smiled that way after sex when he allowed her to cuddle against his warm chest and she listened to his heartbeat until it hypnotized her. ""Should I just throw to myself?"" Preston asked. She gestured for him to throw and he shook his head. They had been together for four years and most spring and summer days during the last two years had brought them out here to Pitchers' Ally. She knew the routine. She knew what was expected. There was no situation where she didn't know her role. A happy rela- tionship, and eventually a happy marriage, depended on knowing each other and satisfying the expectations. Part of the expectations was main- taining the routine and the ritual. The time she spent catching his pitches was part of it, a big part of it. If she neglected him out here on his homemade field, he was likely to neglect her in the house where he could be so gentle. He might even get rid of her. There were other wo- men out there. He often reminded her of that. Allie caught the next pitch and almost cheered. ""Miracle of all miracles,"" Preston said. She caught most of the pitches for the next hour. One went into the dirt and bounced off her shin but it hadn't hit directly. There would be a massive bruise there but the bone was okay. A few sailed past her to hit the backboard and each time Preston reminded her that he was taking it easy on her. He could still throw it ninety, if he wanted. God forbid she actually be able to catch a real fastball, not this wimpy shit he was giving her. By the time all the balls were gathered next to her in a sloppy pile, Al- lie's hands were completely numb. When she stood, her legs wobbled and the world tilted for a moment as if everything might slide off into nowhere. Preston grabbed the empty bucket and walked several feet off the mound toward her. He set it down, stood straight, and punched the in- side of his glove. ""Now, let's see if you still throw like a baby."" He laughed as if that was him being charming and she smiled back because maybe it was and if she wanted the really kind side of him to come out she had to put up with the coarser edges. She grabbed a ball and ran through the many things Preston had told her about throwing. She gripped the ball with her thumb and first two fingers and stared at Preston's glove, held up for her at chest height. She cocked her arm. Her hand began to cramp but she squeezed the ball harder and threw. The toss was lopsided and Preston had to take three quick steps forward to reach it, but he caught it. She smiled but she really wanted to cheer. That throw hadn't been great but it hadn't been bad at all. She was getting better. The ball dropped into the bucket with a hollow thud. ""Next,"" Preston said. Her hand cramped around the next ball and she stared at it a moment. She pulled back her arm and winced at the knot of pain blooming in her shoulder. She swung forward and her arm melted like rubber on scorch- ing concrete. The ball fell well short. He stood there, arms akimbo, and shook his head like he would at a dog that messed on the rug. ""I mean, shit, Allie. I'm not asking for fast- balls here. Just a simple game of catch."" She picked up the next ball. The stitches rubbed against her fingers but she felt the sensation as something from far away, like her body and mind had split and the signal from her nerves had to travel through the air to reach her. Her legs shook. Please, God, don't let me lose control yet. I've barely started. Let me get through half of these at least. Half and he might let it go. Might say I had tried my best. ""Next,"" he said. Her hand was shaking now too and when she went into her thrower's position, her whole arm began to shake. ""You look like Gumby,"" Preston said and laughed. The sun was still high in the cloudless sky but it had arced past its highest point and begun the long, slow descent, which would eventually take it behind the PITCHER'S ALLY scoreboard. She squinted against the glare. She wasn't wearing a ball cap, either. She asked for one, a pink one to match the glove, but Preston told her that ball caps made girls look like dikes. Preston was wearing his, of course; he had started to bald in his early twenties and was still preserving the patchwork up there. The few times he had gone without a hat during these pitching sessions, his scalp burned bright red. She told him to wear the hat you don't want to get cancer, do you? She thought for a moment how cancer would wither his muscles and eventually kill him, how that would set her free. She cried all night after that thought because she couldn't believe she could think something so horrible. If Karma was real, she would get cancer. ""At this rate, it'll take until next week,"" Preston said. ""I'm getting hungry, you know."" Black spots popped up in front of her. They floated before her for a moment before fading. She tried to squint them away but more ap- peared. One blacked out Preston's face. It reminded her of scribbled-out faces in yearbooks. He was right. She had to get moving because dinner wasn't going to cook itself, after all. She was going to make shrimp parmigiana, his favorite, and she still had to thaw the shrimp, then peel and de-vein them. She hadn't made any fresh sauce this week, so she'd have to use the jar kind. If she was sly about it he wouldn't notice. She'd sneak out to the recycle bin when he was in the shower. ""Throw the fucking ball,"" he said. The ball sagged through the air and hit the ground several feet in front of Preston. He stared at it as if it were a piece of fallen debris from a spaceship. ""What the hell is that?"" ""I'm sorry,"" she said. More black spots smudged her vision. She bent toward the pile of balls and vertigo almost toppled her. Her head felt like it weighed a thousand pounds and yet was completely hol- low and buoyant, a balloon filled with helium. She grabbed her knees, clenched her jaw, and inhaled very slowly un- til the feeling passed. It might have only been a few seconds. ""Don't play sick just because you're afraid to try,"" Preston said. ""You make me feel like I'm the bad guy."" He chuckled. Why did it matter if she could or couldn't throw a baseball? Why the hell did he care so much? He was the athlete, not her, as he had made clear many, many times. It was stupid and a waste of time and if she had any kind of backbone, she would throw the glove down and walk inside. She couldn't do that, though. Preston was a bit hard-edged sometimes, but he loved baseball and he wanted her to love it too. He co-owned a training facility for young kids and teens and she had seen him work one-on-one with little kids, showing them how to hold a baseball, how to use the whole body to propel the throw. When those kids tossed pitches as weak as her last one, Preston clapped and said that was okay, was good actually, and then dusted off another ball and handed it over. Now, let's see your real fire power, he'd say and the kid would laugh and, in- variably, the second throw would be at least somewhat better. In those moments, Allie loved Preston more deeply and completely than she could ever fully articulate. When Gretta got on her horse about what a dick Preston was and how she needed to get the hell out of his home, Allie would think about the little kids he could teach to throw a baseball. She would think about that and know she couldn't leave him and that she wanted to have his child. ""Look,"" Preston said. ""I'll be nice. Just a few more tries and you can get started on my dinner. Okay, sugar pie?"" She nodded, grabbed another ball. Preston punched the inside of his glove. ""Alright, good. Now show me you're not a total waste."" The black blemishes had faded and if she squinted against the sunlight they almost vanished completely and she could tell herself that she was okay. Tired, that's all. She threw this one harder and it went farther, but well to the left. In exaggerated fashion, Preston watched it fly by as if the ball were miles away. ""You're not fucking blind, are you?"" She was trying, trying so hard, but she was exhausted. She needed to stop, to rest, to sleep. She couldn't, though. There was still dinner and then the dishes to clean and then Preston would have his nightly ice cream sunday with whipped cream and hot fudge and afterward he might want her to give him something special. She would do whatever he wanted because she loved him. She would take him in her mouth and please him while he watched her with bug eyes and a ring of chocolate syrup around his lips. She could cry. She would save that for later, of course, after he was asleep. She would watch his Adam's apple and cry. It wasn't because she felt sorry for herself; it was because she was so damned tired. For a wo- man who worked only twenty hours a week at a retail job, her life was more exhausting than she could really explain. When she reached for another ball, all the exhaustion from her entire life pushed down on her shoulders. She sagged forward, grabbed her knees again. ""Oh, Christ,"" Preston said. ""Is this your thing now? Your little show of just how horrible this whole experience is?"" She was a little girl helping her mother with the dishes while Mom ex- plained that sometimes Daddy said mean things but that he loved both of them very much. Tomorrow she had to clean and then get the groceries and deposit her paycheck. Preston wouldn't let her have direct deposit because he said sometimes companies try to rip you off that way. A paycheck is a tan- gible thing. He always examined hers first before she could cash it. Allie wondered if he had scammed any of his employees the direct deposit way. She also had to bake an apple pie tomorrow because Dad was coming over for dinner and he loved her pie, said it was better than Mom's, which really was a compliment because she had once won a blue ribbon in a pie contest at a local fair. Mom had been so happy, she'd had the ribbon framed and she hung it in the kitchen next to a baking tin shaped like a lamb. Dad had said that she shouldn't get too prideful, she had managed to bake better than a few retards and feebs. ""Hello!"" Preston called in some stupid cartoonish voice that was sup- posed to sound like a Brooklyn accent. ""You wanna throw the ball there, dolly?"" She thought of all those times she was a child when Dad told Mom she had fudged up the works again and she apologized and did whatever a good wife must to please her husband. She thought of those several months when she and Preston were first dating and he held her hand during dinner and smiled at her and she saw so much potential in that smile. There had been no sense, no hint, that Preston would one day soon grab her arm hard enough to bruise as he yanked her out of his Acura in the middle of a city street because she had spilled her iced cof- fee all over his dashboard. And she heard his emphatic apology. He'd brought her flowers. Begged forgiveness. ""Throw the fucking ball, Allie. You're being a baby."" She stood straight and stared at him with tears beginning to distort her vision. She wanted to beg for him to let her stop, but she also wanted to bean him right in the head and hear him scream and maybe even watch him fall to the ground. He'd lose that hard edge and be a little boy crying about a scarped knee and then she would tend to him and for a brief time, she would be the most important person in the house. Preston caught the next throw as a reflex and stared at his glove for a moment like she had morphed into a star pitcher. Ally smiled and stumbled back a step. A bead of sweat rolled down her back and gathered into an annoying inch at the edge of her bra strap. Her hair hung around her head like something killed and left to rot. She would have to shower, too. It would make her feel better, sure, but if she tried to go to bed without showering, Preston would tell her she was go- ing to develop crotch rot. ""Good,"" Preston said. ""Now give me another one."" ""No."" His expression matched her own inner shock. For several seconds, neither said anything. The bottom edge of Pre- ston's jersey rippled with a small breeze and the skin on her arms chilled. A storm was coming. Or maybe she was imagining that or hop- ing something would happen to break this moment or maybe she was going to pass out and that would be a sort of escape from her transgression. That was her father's word transgression. Her apology came in a quick, flooding torrent. She wasn't even aware of the words pouring forth so much as how pathetic she sounded, how much like the little girl who spilled milk and had to mop the whole floor while Mom and Dad watched television in the other room. ""You done?"" Preston asked. She nodded but the apology still dribbled from her mouth. ""Good,"" he said. ""Now throw."" ""I can't."" Those two words managed to squeeze between her sobs. ""What?"" ""Please,"" she said. ""Please. I can't."" She had never really spoken those words but they had rolled through her mind many times before as giant red letters glowing on a scrolling marquee. Saying the words made her feel weaker still. Even more pathetic. She hated herself. Why was she so damned stupid and weak? Her father again. ""Shut up,"" Preston said. ""Throw the fucking ball. Go ahead. Pick one up. You can do it. That's it. Now, throw it."" Her arm sagged with the weight of the baseball. It could have been one of those weighted balls guys threw in the Olympics. The black splotches returned, flashing before her like the lights at a music concert. Dark lights, she thought. That could be the band that was forever play- ing at the concert of her miserable life. Here they are, folks, the purvey- ors of punishment, the masqueraders of misery Dark Lights! A weird, choked giggle burped through her cries. ""Fuck you laughing at?"" The smile that made her love him was gone, swallowed in the quicksand of his face. If she didn't throw the ball he might go to her, but not to comfort or soothe. No, he would unbuckle his belt as he walked and then drag her inside where he would show her what happened to ungrateful bitches who refused to throw a fucking ball. He had only used the belt a few times. It stung like she couldn't be- lieve and left dark bruises that puffed out her flesh. She'd had to sleep on her stomach for two weeks after the last time. It was okay; he had to vent. If she didn't let him release his tension things could get really nasty. That whipping had been a momentary hiccup of madness. Like the thing at Thanksgiving. Only that had been worse, even though he hadn't even touched her. ""Throw the fucking ball, you stupid cunt."" She sobbed harder, almost collapsed. This was only the angry Preston, not the crazed one from Thanksgiving. No matter what happened, she could relax knowing that while his belt might come off, nothing worse would happen. Nothing really dreadful. She cocked back her arm and tried to will it forward but her shoulder collapsed. The ball dropped to her feet. It rolled through the dirt and stopped. The smudge of dirt on its bright white surface looked like a face with a cracked smile. She used to draw smiley faces in the margins of her notebooks in high school. Sometimes she added little tears falling from the eyes but the smiles always stayed. ""Now, you're really pissing me off."" Preston was walking right toward her. He's only angry, she thought. Just anger. Nothing worse. He shook his head slowly as if he had tried and tried and tried and yet she wouldn't behave. Preston seized her upper arm and squeezed it hard enough to stop the flow of blood. Tears fell more rapidly and black smudges surrounded her like invading alien life forms. ""Can't throw a ball?"" Preston said. ""After all this goddamn time, you can't throw a simple fucking baseball?"" She tried to apologize and beg for him to please just let her go inside and start dinner, but her words were garbled sobs and the infantile noises made her cry even more. ""You're so pathetic, you know that?"" His glove fell to the ground. He stared at it a moment. It was some kind of special glove he had used when he played and it was made out of fancy leather or something. He oiled it weekly and never let her touch it. ""There! You made me drop my fucking glove. Now it's all dirty and God forbid you offer to clean it. Christ!"" She would clean it and clean it painstakingly but there was no point in saying so. He would call her a lying cunt, and take his belt off. What had she done to deserve this life? ""You're gonna learn right now. For once and always, this is how you throw a goddamn baseball."" He released her arm and snatched a ball off the ground. Stabbing needle pain prickled through her hand as blood resumed its journey through her veins. She cradled it as if the hand were broken. He grabbed her right hand, snapped back her fingers, pushed the ball into her palm, and rolled her fingers over it, his on top of hers. ""First, you have to grip the ball. Really feel it in your hand? You feel that, sugar pie?"" Her fingers flattened between his grip and the ball, which felt like a hard steel weight, even a tiny cannonball. ""Now, you swing back your arm."" He yanked her arm back. Her whole body twisted to the side, her feet tangled together and she would have fallen, but he held her vertical with only his grip on her hand. Pain flared in her shoulder. ""And now, dear, sweet, little Allie,"" he said and cupped his other hand under her chin. ""You hear me, darling? You hear me?"" He twisted her head toward him and something cracked in her neck as if this were just a visit to the local sadist chiropractor. ""You know what happens now? Huh? Do you?"" She managed to squeeze a ""Yes"" out amid her cries. If he released her, she would collapse into a pile. She was his marionette and he wanted her up and dancing. Puppets did exactly as instructed. Puppets did not transgress. ""Oh, you do, do you?"" he said. ""Well, shit, Allie, why don't you show me? Can't do it? Can't you do one simple fucking thing right? All you have to do is throw the ball!"" He whipped her arm forward and released his grip on her hand at the last second. The ball actually flew a few feet through the air before boun- cing across the grass toward the pitcher's mound. ""Well, holy shit,"" Preston said. ""You can throw."" He released her completely and she fell to her knees. A few baseballs rolled around her. He picked up his glove and headed back toward the mound. She fought against the flooding tears and childish sobs. Her whole body hurt, especially her right shoulder. He had almost yanked it out of the socket. But the pain really wasn't that bad. It was the exhaustion that made her cry. The knowing that he might keep this going for hours and then still scold her for not having dinner ready. It wasn't the pain and it wasn't even the exhaustion that really crippled her. If she dared to be honest with herself. Stop being a blind bitch, as Gretta would say. It was the embarrassment. The fucking shame. It was her apologizing to Daddy for whatever stupid transgression she had committed and Mommy ignoring the whole thing. Tears fell and no one ever offered a hug or a tissue. That was little girl bullshit, though,and she knew it. She fell for a mean asshole because her father was a mean asshole and that's just the way it went. Maybe Preston would change and maybe he wouldn't. She wasn't as stupid as Gretta believed. She knew he wasn't the greatest guy, but he had his moments and those good times could carry her through. How's that working out for you right now? What? Cat got your tongue, sugar pie? It wasn't shame. She could pretend that was the truth if she wanted but it wasn't. Gretta knew everything that happened. Allie wasn't em- barrassed to share the details. She liked how Gretta always tried to con- vince her to runaway. That made Allie feel good. Gretta really cared, but she knew how far to push it, and when Preston took off his belt or pinched her hard enough to leave a bruise on her hip, Allie told Gretta and listened while her friend called him an asshole. When Preston grabbed her breasts like he was trying to rip them off and told her she was a good cocksucker, a real good cocksucker, Allie told Gretta and made it sound like a perverted sex game so Gretta said she'd have to find herself a sex weirdo like that too. And when Preston snuck up be- hind her and slapped her ass so hard it squeezed out tears from her eyes or when he said she had wrinkled his jerseys and punched her in the side so she could piss blood for a week as a reminder of her misstep, Al- lie told Gretta she had been carrying the laundry downstairs and tripped, landed right on her side, silly klutz. Yeah, no shame there. Completely embarrassment free. They call that one denial, sugar pie. ""I'm waiting,"" Preston called. He was Daddy. Sitting on her bed at the end of the hall, making her walk to him, pull down her pants so he could discipline her the right way. Give her the spanking a transgressor deserved. ""First, you have to stand up."" Allie Moss knew all the reasons she was with Preston and could recog- nize every excuse she manufactured for his behavior. She was a cliche life-long abuse victim who didn't even value her own life enough to ut- ter one syllable in her own defense. She grabbed the nearest baseball. It wasn't her fault. Maybe she had committed horrible acts in a previ- ous life and had to now suffer the punishment. Maybe she really de- served this abuse. Maybe that's what went with love, hand-in- hand kisses and kicks. ""Any day, sugar pie,"" Preston called. If she deserved it then that was fine. She could accept that. Grin and bear it, as Daddy would say. But why did they have to be so vicious about it? Was there no mercy for her? No brief respite from this hell? Frustration and shame tangled together and throttled her. She couldn't suck in enough air to fill her lungs, couldn't stop the damn tears from running down her cheeks, couldn't steady her hand as it shook the baseball. This was her whole life in an instance of inaction. She had always been the victim. Always swayed in whatever direction the cruel wind blew. She had never once fought back, never dared to push against the breeze. ""You're just being a baby,"" Preston said. ""I'm only trying to help."" Maybe he was. Maybe in some sick way, Preston actually thought that if he was mean enough to her, she would toughen up and become a strong, confident woman. Yet she hadn't. She was nothing more than a blubbering mess. A waste. A failure. She screamed. It sounded hoarse and burned her throat. She threw the ball toward Preston and didn't care where it landed. Didn't care if it reached him, flew past him, or fell well short like the others. She grabbed another ball and threw it. Her shoulder hurt and her arm shook with ex- haustion but she took up another ball and threw it. And another. She was being childish and ridiculousness, but grabbing the balls and throw- ing them without thinking was liberating. To not care. To not give a crap if she was doing it the right way. This was freedom. She threw them faster. One after the other. Adrenaline gave her energy and strength. She threw harder. She didn't watch how far the balls went or what the hell Preston was doing amid the shower of baseballs. If he wanted her to throw all of the balls back to him, that was just what she was going to do. She screamed with every throw but her throat was scraped raw and her shouts were mere cries, but in her mind the cries echoed through the air and into the distant woods and all the way to the mountains far off on the horizon. She was pathetic, yes, but not at this moment. No, right now, Allie Moss was a woman of power and strength and pride and self-respect and she wasn't going to allow anyone to tell her what she could and couldn't ""Fuck!"" Preston shouted. The violence promised in that outburst froze Allie mid-throw. The ball dropped from her hand. Preston stood hunched over near the pitcher's mound, hand on the side of his head. He had dropped his glove. Baseballs were strewn all around him. ""Fuck is wrong with you? You hit me."" This was the moment to be real tough and strong and say, Yeah, well, how do you like it, huh, sugar pie? Instead, she said nothing. He bent over further. ""Oh, you bitch!"" She could only stare. She had hurt him. It was such a crazy idea that she didn't fully processes it. She had hurt him. It had been by accident but part of her had probably been hoping for it to happen. Hoping one of her errant throws cracked off his skull. ""You're pretty proud of yourself, huh, bitch?"" Preston said. She wiped her face. The tears had stopped. ""Proud you hurt me? That the kind of whore you are? That what you talk about when you're letting guys fuck you up the ass?"" This wasn't the typical anger and not merely the anger of the injured and embarrassed: this was the precursor to one of his mental breaks. This was how it had started on Thanksgiving. Accusations of raunchy sexual escapades with other men. ""That homo Patrick you work with, you let him fuck you up the ass? Or do you strap one on and give it to him? Huh? That fucking Irish cock- sucker thinks he can fuck you and I won't find out?"" Patrick was one of the managers at Candle Box, the home goods store where she logged twenty hours a week. He was a year older than her and liked to talk about books and movies, most she had never heard of, but he was a nice guy. With a cute smile. ""I'm right, aren't I?"" Preston laughed as if he had finally figured out the big ruse. ""You are fucking him. And he told you to hit me. Didn't he?"" He took his hand off his head and stared at his palm for several seconds. ""I'm bleeding. You dumb, fucking whore!"" She knew her role. She should be begging for mercy and apologizing profusely, but all she could do was sit there on her knees and watch her boyfriend accuse her of being a whore all because she had accidently hit him in the head with a baseball. It was like watching a weird science ex- periment or a drug trial where patients started clawing out their eyes. Preston stared at his hand again and then at her. ""Fucking cunt."" She opened her mouth and started to say that he should calm down, a line which would most certainly have the opposite effect, when he snatched up a baseball and threw it at her. She was too surprised to move. It sailed past her and bounced off the backboard behind her with a vibrating GONG! A slight breeze from the pitch disturbed wisps of her hair. He growled and grabbed another ball. Allie had to get away, had to run. Gretta was right. One of these days he was going to kill her and that day might be right now. Preston was going to throw every one of those baseballs right back at her and if he knocked her unconscious he still wouldn't stop throwing. He would pummel her body with ninety-mile- per-hour throws. Preston kicked up his leg, swung back his arm, and Allie had a mo- ment to think, Now let's see your real fire power, before the ball hurtled right toward her face. ",candidate00001
10,00005,unknown,"My wife Clara shrieked (it sounded like omigod, but was probably in- decipherable; spouses who know their other well can interpret jumbled speak intuitively) and swung the SUV onto the shoulder of the road. I jerked into the door with the sudden movement and started to ask her what the hell she thought she was doing when she yelled again. ""... a boy! There's a boy. In the Trash!"" Before I could ask what she was talking about, she jumped from the car and ran around the front to a pile of garbage at the foot of a long, gravel driveway. A rotted metal storage cabinet and a wooden desk with fractured legs stood among numerous black trash bags heaped into a bumpy hill. My wife, always the type to jump at opportunity, to in fact seize it by the throat and drag it home-as she did me many years ago-sprang onto the hill of black bags like a child on a mound of raked leaves. My fingers found the button for the window and it started to lower; an October breeze whistled in. My incredulous question prepared to drop from my lips again when one of the trash bags my wife stepped on exploded in a rain of Styrofoam cubes-the pieces jumped at her like flies, clinging to her clothes and long, curly, brown hair-and as the bag depressed from my wife's foot, a thin, pale leg shown from the garbage with the vulgar real- ity of a crime scene. There was a boy. In the trash. I opened the door and jumped out. Clara swatted at the floating Styrofoam pieces, bent toward the leg (a boy!), grabbed another black trash bag filled with angular objects that stretched the plastic as though a creature were trapped inside trying to break free, and rolled it off the pile. She gasped in a half scream and stepped back. Had someone killed this kid and dumped him here? The horror of see- ing a dead child in such a condition paralyzed me-it was different to see a child dead in a hospital bed with multicolored striped sheets huddled around his slight frame-but the utter indifference in dropping a child in the garbage filled me with revulsion. My wife covered her mouth. This would be harder for her. Fathers, good fathers, were capable of inexhaustible love for their children, but only a mother possessed that love from conception. There had been endless hours of psychiatry, thou- sands of pages about grieving and moving on, tears that persisted no matter how red your eyes got or how many tissues you had already soiled. I had survived; I was unsure about my wife. She looked at me, eyes wide. Others may have questioned this look, wondering how what they saw could correlate with their expectations, but I knew my wife's looks: ex- citement burst from her face. ""Tell me it's a million dollars that just looks like a child,"" I said. She slowly lowered her hand from her open mouth. ""It's Peter!"" she nearly hollered. She turned back to what lay at her feet. Fear, horror, and nausea swirled together in my gut and tied my in- testines in a knot. Clara had coped-the word was laughable when a par- ent lost a child-better than a few of the psychologists had expected she would, but they told me to watch out for delusions, hallucinations even. I stepped onto the trash pile. ""Honey, Pete's been,"" I started to say but couldn't finish with, dead for three years now so he can't possibly be in a trash heap at the foot of someone's driveway and you certainly can't start having a mental break- down now that the counseling is over. She stood still, face open in thrilled surprise. I stepped next to her, my hand going to the small of her back as instinctively as an infant turning at the sound of his mother's voice, and told her that it was okay, whatever she was feeling, that we would work it out together, that we'd get by as we always had. We'd rely on our spousal sense, as one of the psychiatrists had called it: our innate ability to know what the other needed. ""Just look,"" she said. I didn't want to. I didn't want to see what it was she had mistaken for our dead child who now lay beneath mounds of dirt in a box marked by a headstone with his first grade school picture carved into it. Holding my breath, I looked at what my wife had spotted in a trash heap while driving down a back road to go to the movie theatre at the galleria. I almost screamed. Peter's dark blue eyes stared back at me, open and full of life as though he were about to ask if I wanted to throw him a few fastballs again, see if he couldn't knock one back to me. A few streaks of dirt marked his glow- ing skin and I wanted to ask him what he had been doing, playing in the garden again most likely. I started to bend toward him, to pick my son up and ask who had dared him to lay in a trash heap when the unnatural stiffness of his arms, the right stuck out straight and the other pinned to his body, and his legs rigidly joined at the calves as though his skin had melted, stopped me. I pulled back. If not for the blue T-shirt with a racecar on it and the red shorts-an en- semble Peter had heavily favored in the summer, so much so that Clara had to sneak into his room at night to wash them-I never would have bent even partly. This was not Peter; it was a mannequin someone had decided was taking up too much space in an attic or garage or basement. Still, the face and the eyes made me reappraise. Could it be him? Is this how he had looked on the corner's table when rigor mortis fully seized his muscles? I knew this was not Peter, but- Clara looked so happy, as though she had discovered how to evade Death, that infamous scythe-carrying fiend who took and took and never returned-that she had found a way to get back what Death had no right to take. ""Honey, that's not-"" Her mouth closed a bit and the excitement dropped from her eyes. ""I know that,"" she said sternly. Then she turned back at the mannequin and smiled. ""But look at him."" ""It,"" I said. She bent down and reached for the boy figure that so damn closely re- sembled our son. Something told me to stop her, to say, ""No,"" and pull her back if necessary; something inside me didn't think she should touch the Peter-Copy. When her fingers caressed the mannequin's face, trailing from the brow to the chin as she had done so many times when we had watched Peter sleep as an infant, my stomach tightened and goose bumps spread across my arms like a cold wind had swept over me. She whispered something. ""What?"" I asked. She kept stroking the mannequin's face. ""Clara, we have to get-"" She slipped one hand beneath the Peter-Copy's neck and the other un- derneath its waist. She lifted it out of the trash, Styrofoam bits rolling off the blue shirt that was so similar to the one Peter had adored. ""We're not taking him-it,"" I said. ""He's ours,"" Clara said. ""Look at his clothes."" Though I didn't want to admit it then, wouldn't admit it until later, it was possible the clothes were Peter's because, well, he had been buried wearing that outfit beneath a suit we had bought in the Sears children's department for him to wear to his cousin's wedding, and it was always possible someone had removed the clothes before interment. That doesn't sound plausible, I know, but I knew it was possible. Even then, before the Peter-Copy started talking. I made her put the mannequin in the back of the SUV. She made me drive so she could stare at it from the passenger seat. I knew she wanted to sit in the back with it, to keep stroking its face, but she knew what I would say, how I would mention all the counseling. Even so, my eyes flitted to the rear view mirror numerous times on the drive back home, seeing a movie no longer holding any interest for Clara. I'm not sure why I kept looking, just shocked I guess. Then again, I kept expecting the Peter-Copy to move, twitch, or maybe even to sit up suddenly and say, ""Hey, Dad! Why do you look so pale?"" When we got home, I sat in the bathroom for twenty minutes, half hoping the nausea would pass and half hoping my stomach would purge the bagel and coffee I ingested that morning. Neither happened. I stopped in the hallway outside the bathroom. Clara's laughter, higher pitched than usual and somewhat choppy, filled the house and did to me what fingernails on a chalkboard do to many. I followed the laughter down the hall, past our bedroom and the spare, and stopped outside Peter's room. The door stood slightly open; through the space I saw Clara's back bent forward over our son's bed. The laughter peaked again and I opened the door slowly, fighting the urge to bang it off the wall and demand she stop laughing, demand she stop this nonsense, demand we return the Peter-Copy to the trash heap at the bottom of that driveway. The mannequin lay on the bed, head propped up with two pillows, its rigid back forming a triangle to the bed, fully made in racecar sheets with matching comforter. On her knees, Clara was bent over the bed, laughing at the mannequin's face. Her laughter cut when I opened the door. Though I had made almost no noise, she knew I was there-that damn spousal sense thing. She put a finger to her lips. ""Shhhh."" ""Honey?"" I asked tentatively. She did not turn. I never should have let her take the mannequin from the trash. ""This is not healthy,"" I said. ""It's just a mannequin. If you need me to call Dr. Carter-"" Her head snapped viciously toward me. Her lips pulled back from her teeth, nose and eyebrows rising, eyes icing-and I stepped back. I had never seen this look before, except in low grade horror movies. Her ric- tus squeezed my stomach further and I thought the vomit might actually come, but a moment later her lips settled and her eyes calmed. Had I imagined that? ""I just mean,"" I stumbled to form a sentence, ""that if you need help, someone to talk to, that if those feelings are coming back ... "" I trailed off unwilling to finish, then you need to go to the doctor immediately and get some Valium or Vicodin or Haldol or a straight jacket. I love my wife, have loved her completely for many, many years-when we lost Peter, though, things changed. I don't think we stopped loving each other as much, but the love morphed somehow. I resent her for not watching Peter closely enough as I am sure she hates me for buying him the bicycle that served as his boarding pass on Death's cloak. It's hard to blame the one you love, but it's easier than blaming yourself. We tried to recover, tried therapy, tried books, as I've mentioned, and when she wakes in the night screaming, I hold her close. But part of me wants to let her go, believes it would be easier-and safer-to let her be. While I hate that part of me, I can't argue when it reminds me of how she stood over me one night, cleaver gripped in both hands, and said that good parents would be there for their son, that they would make the sac- rifice for their child. In the middle of the night, I hadn't been very quick and she had swiped me well enough to require twenty stitches. I told the doctor I had been fixing my car and the jack slipped and, well, I was lucky to be alive, right? I don't think he had fully believed me, his eyes continually going to Clara, blood crusted cuticles marking her suspect. ""I have someone to talk to,"" Clara said from her knees. I smiled. ""Yes, but I'm not a-"" ""Peter,"" she said. She turned to the mannequin. Its blue eyes shined like crystals, like our son's had. I left her in the bedroom with the Peter-Copy and re- turned to the bathroom. I thought about those eyes, about how our real son's eyes were probably long gone, decomposed, replaced with squirm- ing maggots. I vomited for quite some time. In the darkness of early morning, my wife's cries came to me. I reached for her next to me, to pull her close and whisper that everything would be okay, and then slip back into sleep, but she was not there. Her side of the bed sat cold. I sat up. The tears vibrated through the wall. From Peter's room. I opened the door to the hallway where the crying rolled off the walls, infecting the air like pollen that attacked your heart instead of your si- nuses. Standing there for a while, swaying slightly as though on a boat, I debated what to do. It does not make me proud that I tried to convince myself that I could not help my wife, that only a professional could assist and since that was the case, I should leave her to her tears and go back to bed. That might not be the loving husband reaction, but it was an honest one. And what stopped me from doing just that was the twitching muscle where the cleaver sliced and left a scar. I opened the door. The mannequin lay on the bed same as earlier; moonlight shone through the blinds, casting parallel lines on it. Clara sat cross legged fa- cing the bed, head bowed, tears streaming off her cheeks onto her linked hands like rain drops. I walked to her, knelt beside her, and placed my hand on her back. I expected her to turn sharply toward me as she had earlier, lips pulled back, eyes freezing. She continued crying. I started the old mantra: ""Everything is going to be okay. Everything is going-"" ""Peter's dead,"" she said softly. My hand stopped. It had taken her three years of counseling just to say that. Perhaps her regression had only been temporary-the loving heart fights fiercely not to abandon hope. ""I know, honey,"" I said. ""But he's okay."" ""No,"" she said. She looked at the Peter-Copy. ""He's not."" ""He's fine."" She turned to me, eyes red. ""No,"" she repeated. ""He needs us. He needs his parents."" The healed muscle tissue twitched hard; I tensed my jaw to cover the sudden stab of discomfort. ""He's fine,"" I said again, more firmly. I rubbed her back. She stared at me for a while and I felt tears gathering in my eyes. The tragedy flooded back as it so often did in the dark hours, reminding me that it never lay very deep. The monstrous screech of tires, the smell of burned rubber, the thick black tire marks that led to a helmet sitting in a pool of blood. The coffin selection, the wake, the burial. The emptiness. Clara dropped her head; more tears speckled her hands. ""He wants us to join him,"" she said. ""He told me."" I kept rubbing her back but could not speak. Eventually, we slept on the floor of our son's room, my arms wrapped around her. I left for work the next morning as always. Clara stayed in Peter's room with the mannequin. When I shut the front door to our house, I swore I heard her laugh. I called Dr. Carter's office on my cell phone and made an appointment for that night. If I had to drag her out of that room and tie her into the car to get her there, I'd do it. Then I called work and said I felt sick but that I'd try to be in for an af- ternoon catch up. I really did intend to go to work, too. But that changed when I spoke to Mrs. Delver and she showed me what she kept in her basement. I drove past the park where Clara and I had taken Peter to ride his bi- cycle. So long as we watched him, he was fine. Even when he was in the road, he always knew to pull to the side when a car approached. Still, we watched. His blood had stained the pavement so badly that it took three weeks for the giant blotches to fade. I drove over the spot where Peter had been taken from this world, from my love. I drove over it and wondered if Peter really did want me and his mother to join him wherever he now existed. Even if Clara had started to slip back into her delusions, there was still something to be said for the mystical connection between mother and child-the umbilical cord can stretch around the world and perhaps even into other worlds. I entered my house, closed the front door, turned, and froze. Peter stood at the top of the stairs, right arm out straight as though he were telling me to come no farther. He smiled and a warm heat pulsed inside me. Clara appeared from the hallway and scooped Peter up in one elegant move. He giggled as she swung him around, her own laughter floating in the air above me like magical notes that I might be able to grab if only I could stretch my arm high enough. Her brown curls blurred Peter's face as they spun and he laughed louder. I smiled. The laughter I heard came from my son and my wife. This was my family. I started up the stairs, forcing myself to move slowly, not wanting to disturb the beautiful image of mother and son twirling in a world only they completely understood but one they willingly shared with me. Then Peter's legs banged against the wall with a hard thownk. Clara stumbled. Her twirls became lopsided as Peter's legs hit the wall again and then she lost her balanced and collapsed. She hit the floor hard. Peter's body bounced. She pulled him close immediately as though afraid someone might snatch him away from her. Peter did not cry. I rushed up the steps and stopped, kneeling at Clara's side. ""Peter, Peter,"" she cried. ""Oh, Peter, Peter."" I stretched out a hand toward her, to push her hair off her face, but could not touch her. I could not touch my sobbing wife. ""That's not Peter,"" I said. She stopped crying immediately. Her head jerked to the side and she stared at me from behind a veil of brown hair. ""He's our son,"" she said. ""And if you can't see that then maybe you forgot."" I stared into her eyes for a while before my gaze turned to the Peter- Copy. And my son, my Peter, stared back. Suddenly, I wanted two things: assuredness and peace. The path those goals led me down is not one I could turn back from, not when my dear son looked at me and said, ""I'm lonely, daddy. I need you."" The garbage pile was gone; we had been lucky enough to find the Peter-Copy before the big, green truck could crush it and carry it to a landfill. I felt as though I had been dipped in an ice bath. Though the air only held a hint of coming winter, I turned the car's heat on full blast. I followed the gravel driveway a quarter mile to a big, white house with large pillars outside. Though in need of a paint job, the house still impressed me-and worried me: a house this big could have untold amounts of garbage. A woman with a cocoon of white hair opened the door after I knocked. She held a cane on which she leaned most of her weight. Her left side looked smaller, frailer, than her right-as though it were atrophying be- neath her white shawl. She looked at me from behind thick bifocals. I ex- pected her to say something but she didn't; she just waited. ""I'm John French,"" I said. ""My wife and I took a mannequin from the trash heap you had out front yesterday and I want to talk to you about it."" She was already turning around and moving back inside in an awk- ward penguin shuffle. She did not close the door, but continued moving into her house, which was dark and damp. ""Uh, Miss?"" ""Come on if you're coming,"" she said in a deep voice laced with years of heavy smoking. ""I got something you wanna see."" I followed her down a narrow hallway into a kitchen that had been decorated in the 1970's and never redone: dirt and mold speckled the dark brown tile and orange trim, and the only light streamed in from a side room where a dark shaded lamp stood next to a sunken recliner. She opened a door to the basement and descended. She moved slowly but without pause. The light from the main floor dimmed out into total darkness by the last step. She continued walking however. I followed the sound of her shuffling slippers and the solid stab of her cane on the con- crete floor. She stopped and ruffled with something and then I heard the sound of a match scratching across cardboard and a flame flared up in front of her. The light cast her face in dark shadows that accentuated her sagging flesh. She lit a cigarette in her mouth and shook out the match, dropping it. ""I'm Mrs. Delver,"" she said. ""Mr. Delver passed on some time ago."" She sucked on the cigarette. ""He bought this house with money he made making sculpture. People loved his work. He made all kinds of things, mostly outdoor, lawn decorating stuff."" I nodded though she couldn't see me do it. ""He had a stroke and when he recovered he kept sculpting, but not like before. He changed his focus and no longer sold anything. Didn't try to sell anything."" I felt like someone was watching us from the corners, listening to the old woman's story, calculating when to pounce. ""Why not?"" I asked. ""He wrote up a list. He numbered each work and put a date next to it. Said to have the specific work put outside by the road on the specific day-said its owner would find it. You're not the first one to come looking for answers, Mr. French."" ""Wait,"" I said. ""Are you saying ... "" ""There's a light bulb above you. Find the cord and pull it."" I found the string cord and turned the light on. Adults and children of different sizes, builds, colors, and wearing all kinds of clothes, stared at me from their positions lining the walls. Aside from the solid rigidity of their limbs (some arms outstretched, some legs spread), they could have been real people pretending to be statues. Their unblinking eyes made me continually look them over, spinning around to see the ones on the other side of the basement, afraid one of them-or all of them-would suddenly rush me. ""Weird hobby, I know,"" she said. ""But when he came out of that stroke, there was no stopping him. He kept creating until he died. Worked all day and night. He told me they talked to him, the mannequins."" ""Talked?"" My throat was closing. ""Said that each one wanted to find their owner, said they were lonely. That's why I have the list, made me swear I'd keep putting them out un- til I finally pass. I don't have answers, not exactly. But if there's enough arrows pointing in the same direction, I tend to accept it, you know?"" I did. ""And the clothes?"" ""Don't know,"" she said. ""He sometimes disappeared for a day or two, returning with bags of shirts and pants. Said the mannequins told him where to look."" Blue shirt. Red shorts. ""How did your husband die?"" I asked. She choked out a laugh. ""The man in the black cloak got him, as he gets us all."" She sucked hard on her cigarette and I fled the house. I sped home, pushing the car as fast as I dared around the curves of the mountainous landscape where we lived. I looked in my rearview again and again, expecting to see an army of mannequins chasing me, or maybe just a sea of shining eyes. ""Clara!"" I ran up the stairs, down the hall, and banged Peter's bedroom door open. I screamed. May wife lie on the bed, the Peter-Copy set on top of her. Her right hand rested on the mannequin's shirt; the other had fallen off and hung over the bed's edge. A large puddle of blood soaked the carpet beneath that dangling hand and the blue racecar shirt had gone black in a huge splotch that overflowed onto the comforter. Clara's face had lost all color. The mannequin looked more alive than she. I took several steps toward her and stopped when I saw the gaping wound in her left wrist; she had damn near torn her hand off. The cleaver-the same cleaver-had fallen into the Peter-Copy's lap. I stood still and waited to faint or wake up. When neither happened, I walked to my wife's side, stepping over the puddle. I touched her face, some warmth still lingering. My fingers trailed down her cheek. I looked at the mannequin, at those eyes. I couldn't turn away. Had Mr. Delver found a way to beat Death, maybe not cheat him com- pletely, but a route around him, through his blind spot? Returning from his stroke, had Mr. Delver found his head full of voices begging to be re- united with their loved ones? Had Peter been one of those voices? I fell into my son's gorgeous blue eyes and I swear I heard him say, ""I miss you, daddy."" Tears falling from my eyes steadily and with ease as though I could cry forever, I said, ""I miss you too, son."" The pain pulsated throughout me. I reached for the knife and wondered if Death stood near, scythe poised to take another life. I love you, Peter. I'll see you soon. ",candidate00001
11,00006,unknown,"In times of reckoning, there are always those that feel that they have been cheated; that the path hewn for them through the mountains and valleys and plains of destiny is not theirs. It belongs to some other, some more or less worthy soul, dependant upon the trials they have to face along that path. Carson was one such, believing himself better. Better than all by a long way. He had killed, he had hurt and defiled in his time, believing it his right, his destiny. He had the blood of many on his conscience, if such a man can be said to have one. He had the utter surety that only his kind possess; arrogant, righteous and utterly without remorse. His own reckoning, then, was a rude affair, coming late one night as he slept. The demon of his reckoning, a foul creature all scale and hair and reeking pomposity, was sitting on his chest as he woke, startled. ""Wha ?"" he began, before his voice dried like arid desert air. He croaked the question again, fully formed. The demon, called Lot, in a gesture seen by many and remembered by few, carved shapes from the air with stout fingers and settled these patterns of gossamer nothingness across Carson""s mouth. He fell silent immediately. ""Better,"" it said in a surprisingly quiet voice. ""It is time,"" it said, and stroked a gnarled finger across Carson""s chest. Instantly pained bloomed there, like a number of ever tightening steel bands in and around his chest. The demon continued to caress the flesh of Carson""s body, pinching here, pulling there, as if it were working its strange magic in his meat, as it had done with the air around him; knotting his flesh into unnatural configurations. Carson resisted as much as he was able, and even struck the demon with one flailing hand before Lot left off his manipulations long enough to wring shackles from the air, which he laid almost lovingly across arms and legs, effectively stilling him. Carson""s hand buzzed unpleasantly where it had touched the demon, as if poisoned. His head whipped back and forth as if trying to shake off the silencing charms placed there. Still he could not speak. ""Fighting with me will not change anything,"" Lot purred. ""It is time."" For an hour Lot worked on the man, drawing pain and terror, memory and experience from him like heat will draw sweat. At the end, when Carson""s body was wracked with nauseating fever, his bed spotted with blood spray from nose and eyes and mouth, his mind empty of all but the sins he had lived, lived in, lived for, Lot removed the shackles and the silencing charms that he had wrought from nothingness. Carson gasped. ""What are you?"" he managed to say before the last of his strength left him. ""Would you have me tell you, or show you?"" asked Lot. Another twist of atmosphere, a pulling apart of space with the pinched thumb and forefinger of both hands. The shape hanging from his delicately pinched digits, had Carson been able to see it, was a rough rectangle. Lot laid one end on the bed above Carson""s head. He seemed to grasp more firmly the other corners and drew it down over Carson""s body like a shroud. It settled with the weight of a child""s breath and suddenly Carson saw. He saw through it, like wet muslin. He saw what Lot was, and more importantly, he saw why Lot was. He was not a religious man, never had been, but he thought he knew a reckoning when he saw one. This, then, was his, for good or ill. ""Are you death?"" he croaked as reality melted away. ""Am I paying now for all that I have done?"" Lot only laughed and gagged him once more. He reached to Carson""s face with those stubby fingers and laid them across his forehead. Instantly that drawing sensation flooded him again, as if Lot was a sponge and his mind was water. He felt himself emptying, imagined a child sucking the colour from a snow cone. He retreated deep into himself, raced backwards down the black corridor of his mind, snatching at memory and feeling as he went, all of it slipping through his grasp. There was nothing but sin left now, all the acts of cruelty, all the faces of those he had defiled, hurt, destroyed with his words and his fists and his money. He snatched at one, a girl. The memory of her hurt lingered for a moment, and he remembered the feeling of fist against stomach, the gentle snapping of brittle bone, the defilement of soul. He sickened himself suddenly, knew he deserved this demon sent to reckon him, but suddenly the memory was gone, sucked from his grasp and all he had left was her face, her beautiful ruined face, with its startling grey eyes and soft dark lips. He clung to it, folded it like a photograph and hid it deep within, mentally shrouding it with whatever was left of him. The drawing stopped, and he sensed a searching, probing motion, like the wet nose of a bloodhound shifting in and around him. He steeled himself and locked down further. The face of the girl remained hidden. Suddenly there was movement above him as the shroud was lifted from his motionless body. Light and sound faded in, and he woke as if from a coma. He was staring into the at once senseless and somehow raging eyes of the demon. ""WHERE IS IT?!"" Lot roared, stinging spittle flying like rain. He beat Carson on the chest and a rib snapped. Pain flared but soon numbed. ""GIVE IT TO ME!"" Carson was, by this time, a bereft man. He knew the demon""s face, as he knew his own, knew its business, but all else was gone from him. All, except the memory of that face that he kept inside himself, somewhere, somehow. He had no idea how he was keeping it from Lot, or why, but it was all he had left to hold onto. And he held tight. Lot reached to his mouth and scraped a finger across it, tearing at the formless gag made from air. Carson took a huge whooping breath, as if he hadn""t been able to breathe this whole time. ""No,"" he whispered, feebly. ""You can""t have it."" ""I MUST!"" A savage blow to the side of his head, and Carson had the mind to wonder that a demon so adept at torturing with thought and sense and fear, should resort to physical violence at the end of it all. Carson managed a laugh, content to die now, feeling that he had already bested the demon, knowing really that he hadn""t. He had a feeling that his body would not recover from all the pulling and wrangling and manipulating. It felt broken in some fundamental way, bones felt pulverised, skin stretched beyond its natural elastic tendencies. He laughed again and Lot screamed his anger and frustration. ""I need that last face,"" it said more quietly. ""I must have the face. You know this. Your reckoning is over and I must have that face."" Its face had calmed but there was still fierce light in its eyes, now turned the colour of burning toffee. Carson quelled an urge to scream and give up his prize. But he didn""t believe his reckoning was over, for the demon was sitting on his chest still. Its gaze was a strong hook in his brain, pulling, snagging, searching for any memory left unplundered, any nugget of his life left intact. It searched, and still Carson had no notion of how he was keeping the girl""s face from him. Indeed, as the demon found tidbits of memory and extracted those almost as if he was tossing clothes over his shoulder in the search for a favourite shirt, Carson buried the face deeper still, until even he could hardly reach it. Lot pulled free suddenly and screamed piercingly into the still of the night. Carson""s ears fell mercifully deaf at that moment, sound slowly filtering back in as if his ears were filled with tar. ""You cannot have it,"" Carson replied slowly. A violent scratching hiss filled the room. Carson smelled burning hair and ozone. The demon whipped its head a full one hundred and eighty degree turn and looked over its shoulder. Carson thought he sensed fear in the movement. There appeared behind the demon a misty drape of air, like a thin sheet of fog at the foot of his bed. He thought he heard murmurings and icy crackles emanating from it. Lot was listening intently, and bowed his head at the sound. He nodded to himself and turned back to Carson with a look of pleading now playing on his face. His voice was soft. ""Please,"" he said. ""Just give me the face and I can go on my way. As can you. You cannot deny a reckoning. It has to be. One way or the other I will get that face, and you will be reckoned. You know your time here is nearly done. I am here to move you on, but first I need that face that you hide from me. I need to empty you."" His teeth clenched as he said this last, and his voice turned to a hiss. Carson looked behind the demon and motioned with his eyes. ""The boss?"" he asked. ""Pressuring you? I can show you some techniques for dealing with the stress."" He had become unnatural calm, confidence stealing into his words as he realised that the demon would not, could not leave him here without that face that he held. He smiled again. He had a notion that Lot could not kill him either, certainly not before he knew he could go back to his boss with a full compliment of Carson""s sinful memories. His mouth thick with congealing blood and saliva, he coughed as he spoke again. ""Where am I to be moved onto? Hell?"" He did not flinch at the absurdity of that thought. ""Hell. Heaven. These are just words that you have dreamt up to satisfy your need to categorise yourself. All humans are the same. Am I a saint, or am I a sinner?"" These last words he spoke with more anger, mimicking Carson""s tone precisely. ""There is but one stage of reckoning. You all reach it eventually. And you are neither saint nor sinner. You just are. What destiny awaits is only a matter of degree. In your eyes, it is good or it is bad. To mine, it just is. But I must take you completely. I cannot bring you if you retain a shred of memory, of deed."" He stole another backwards glance, eyes blinking rapidly. ""No,"" said Carson softly. There was a short silence, made unbearable by the notion that Lot was using all his power not to erupt in anger. He spoke, forcibly soft, ""What did you say?"" ""I said no,"" Carson whispered. ""You obviously cannot kill me. You would have done so already. You need that memory and I said no. I am not giving it up. Kill me if you can, but it dies with me."" Carson was awash with the overwhelming notion that he must defy this creature. It was more important to him now than the memory of the ruined, beautiful face. Clearer, somehow. The desire to see this demon bested, to see it suffer at the hands of that master that inevitably waited for it behind the curtain of shifting fog, in some hellish dominion. Carson had no doubt that he would die here tonight, that indeed Lot would suffer his punishment gladly just to see him die, memory given over or not. But to die with that face secure inside him. That was the game now. That was the reckoning. He laughed, a bubbling splattering laugh, his blood hissing faintly against the rough flesh of Lot""s ever darkening features. ""You sicken me,"" said the demon, its distaste visible in the set of its mouth, the half lidded eyes. Carson marvelled that this beast could be sickened at all, let alone by his simple act of defiance, but there it was. ""That you think yourself so important, that you think your memories, your acts, so important. You scurry and skulk through life hurting and debasing all life around you, killing even, when it is not your right to do so."" Carson interrupted, emboldened. ""And is it your right?"" ""It has always been so. I have always been so. You are not the first to defy me and you will not be the last. But still you sicken me, taking what is mine and hiding it away like some deviant schoolchild. Your time here is done, and yet you cling to hope and to your last surviving memory like they are yours to keep. Your reckoning, your.judgement if you prefer.is my duty and your destiny. You cannot escape it. As I cannot. So end this foolishness, give me the face and we can end all this."" There was a pause, time in which the soft breathy shifting curtain of fog behind Lot seemed to darken, congeal as though it were scum at the edges of a pool. Faint smells of fear and pain and death, if such things can be said to have aroma, taunted him. Lot closed his eyes and breathed deeply, his stout fingers clutching the air. ""Please,"" he said, softer. ""Please. I cannot bring you with me, judged and reckoned, unless I have you entirely. One memory held back means nothing to you. It cannot save you. And yet to give it over will save you. You can enter the realm behind me a cleansed man, fully paid up for the atrocities you committed in this place. Life will be good for you in there, it will be."" ""No."" Carson shook his head, despite the searing pain in his temples. Blood, dried to a soft crust across his cheeks and brow, flaked and fell to the pillow beneath him. ""No."" Lot reached for him, not physically, but with his searching mind, wrenching shapes from the air as he did so, weaving existence into a web of formlessness that he laid across Carson, its edges tightening around him. Carson took a huge breath, sure that it would be his last, and the hard thrumming of his heart in his ears was slowly drowned out by the scream from the demon. Searing hot spittle flew like acid rain from his lips, drawn back in a paroxysm of fury. Carson screwed his eyes shut against the wetness, and used that last breath to scream back. ""No, no, no, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!"" and the sound was muted, as though heard through glass. Within himself, he imagined tearing the face from its hiding place and shredding it, scattering the shreds like so much confetti to the corners of his mind. ""IT IS MINE!"" he roared, and this sound did break through the demon""s ranting. He felt Lot shift slightly on him, and opened his eyes to see a long fleshy tether wrap itself around Lot""s neck, cutting into the deviant flesh there, tearing skin like a cheese wire. He could not see through the curtain of mist but could sense a huge shape moving there, a leviathan beneath dark waters; relentless and merciless. Lot screamed and was suddenly gone, pulled back sharply, his screams ended suddenly by the noose around his neck. As he went, Carson felt a fish hook snag into his mind, Lot""s final probing search. He felt it tear, imagined a flood filling his brain, an aneurism of his imagination. He felt his mind drain, the shreds of memory that he had scattered lifting and flowing with the flood like so many dead flower petals on a stream. And then he felt nothing. * Carson stood at his bathroom mirror. The face that stared back was unknown to him. The bruising and lacerations across his face were unknown, and indeed the feelings of pain that he felt now were like the first rude, alien sensations filling a newborn baby""s thoughts. He reached a slow hand to his face, watched its reflection follow, and touched the damaged flesh that it found there. His eyes roamed the contours of his face, empty and sullen. With each fresh wave of sickening pain, fragments of memory resurfaced. He felt that he should know the face, broken and bloodied though it was, but he didn""t. That part of him was gone, and though he could still remember Lot""s hissing vitriol and his burning spittle, the wrought air that he had governed to subdue him, he could not remember why he could not remember his own face. It left him empty. Flutterings began in his violated mind, soft breezes, as if torn paper was being blown down a dark corridor. It seemed that although Lot had sworn to remove every one of Carson""s memories, he had truly only been interested in those dark, viscous memories that dealt with the pain and defilement and deviance that filled so much of Carson""s mind. In the others, those grey and damp, lifeless things in the deepest whorls of his brain, the ones that allowed him to speak and dress and tie his shoelaces, the demon was wholly uninterested. Carson exercised those memories now and dressed fitfully, cleaned his face as best as he could and as thoroughly as he could manage with the pain, and left the house. As dawn rose, he stood on the front lawn and watched the sun rise, breath pluming from him, cold air biting his skin and soothing it in equal measure. He did the only thing he could think to do, and walked. Behind him, a twist of air as a shroud, invisible and silent, Lot followed. Occasionally he would probe Carson""s mind, quickly and without much force, but he could not find the memory of the girl with the grey eyes, the broken face and the broken soul. He thought of that face, and it taunted him. He fixed on it until it became his memory, and it fluttered about his own mind like a bird caught in a greenhouse. Foul fluid seeped from a wound on his neck, and his eyes were downcast and dark, fuming rage barely contained in the quivering of his lips. He watched Carson walk, bereft, silent himself except for the slight rasp in his breathing. Lot""s fingers clicked together with frightening speed, the sound like the first crackle of lightning before the huge crash, all the more terrible for that untapped potential. No-one heard the noise but Lot himself, and he used it to drown out the sound of his own breathing, raw and bloody in his torn throat. Lot followed until the road Carson trod petered out and became a path across rolling fields. He followed as Carson stepped over gate and stile, walked round tree stump and boulder. In the distance the soft thump of drums, almost physical push of deep bass, swallowed them both, the visible and the invisible. Lot pulled his shroud tighter, occasionally glancing behind him. Had Carson cared to look, he may have seen a shimmering, like the heat haze above a hot road. He may have seen a further shimmering rift within the haze, and had he been able to see Lot""s eyes, he would see them dart again and again to this split, fear obvious in their depths. The source of the music showed itself as they rounded a thick copse of trees. A small group of people were dancing in the field, the music blaring from the rear speakers of a car, the boot open, the tang of alcohol and marijuana smoke pricking Lot""s eyes until they watered foul tears. He cleared them with his stubby fingers. And there she was. It was the girl, undoubtedly. Her face unmarked, her bones unbroken, but it was her. Carson stopped at the perimeter of the party, seemingly lost to himself. Lot howled laughter as the girl walked over to Carson, began to talk. He pulled the air to him suddenly, formed a tight rope that he wound around the couple, pulling it tighter. Neither one felt it, but both felt drawn to each other. The girl was drunk and happy to flirt. Carson was utterly sober, utterly bereft of emotion, but something about the girl Grey eyes fluttered, clumsily seductive, hot breath caressed his ear as she whispered. ""Take her, you fool,"" hissed Lot. ""I give her to you again. Take her!"" Carson heard nothing but the thump of music and the soft wind of her voice. But something about her He grabbed her wrist tightly, and felt himself stir in the deep pit of his stomach as he felt small bones shift in is hand. She squealed laughter and led him away. Carson followed, allowing his grip to loosen but knowing that he had the power to crush those bones to powder in his fist. He wondered, suddenly, shockingly, what her face would look like bruised and battered, wondered how her beautiful full lips would look puffed and bloodied. Lot saw all this as he probed Carson. He allowed his own memory of the girl to vanish, and somewhere deep in the folded corners of Carson""s mind, torn scraps of memory began to reform, to reknit themselves. Carson remembered. Lot squatted on the grass and entertained himself by making shapes from the air. These he set to dance as the day darkened and the volume of the music grew. Carson had remembered the girl. Her face would be forming somewhere in his mind, and Lot could wait. He would wait forever to complete this reckoning. He lay back, the demon, and clicked his tough fingernails together on his chest. He sensed the rift behind him closing with a tearing gasp. Soft bubbling laughter welled from his torn throat, and he closed his eyes. ",candidate00002
