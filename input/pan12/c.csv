0,00001,candidate00001,"""Arson Task Force Blazes A Trail"", the headline read. The Herald story went on to describe how the team had slashed the number of arsons by twenty-five per cent in its first year. ""Well done, Sam,"" Les said, slapping me on the back. ""Some people said you couldn’t do it, but I knew you were the man for the job - that’s why I picked you."" Les is my father-in-law as well as brigade chief. I knew he’d only made me Task Force leader to please Mary. The team was his pride and joy. He set it up after a fact-finding visit to America and it was the first of its kind in the UK. When the job as leader came up, I told Mary it would probably go to one of the whizz kids the brigade was fast tracking. ""It’s not fair,"" she said, her face turning an angry red. ""You’ve been overlooked year after year while they promote kids hardly out of training. Just because they’ve got university degrees. What do they know about firefighting? I suppose you’re not going to do anything about it, as usual. It’s just as well you can count on me then, isn’t it? I’ll have a word with Dad."" I flinched. It was a knee-jerk reaction whenever she mentioned Les’ name. ""Leave it,"" I said, through tight lips. ""Why can’t you understand that I’m happy being a station officer? I’m not ambitious."" ""That’s your department,"" I thought. ""You’ve got enough for the two of us."" I wanted to say it but I didn’t. After almost 25 years of marriage I’d learned life was a lot simpler if I kept my mouth shut. ""Why aren’t you a go-getter like dad?"" she’d demanded for the umpteenth time. ""He made chief when he was only 40. He’s the youngest chief the brigade has ever had."" I looked at her coldly, wondering how many years it was since her once-pretty face had become so hard. Had it happened overnight? Or so gradually, I hadn’t noticed. I sat frowning in silence. Oh, I could have told her about the backs Les had stabbed in his ruthless climb to the top, and how he might be the youngest, but he was the most despised chief the brigade had ever had. But I didn’t. Without saying another word I reached for Bruno’s lead. As usual Mary got her way. She spoke to Les and I got the job. I could have turned it down. But it wouldn’t have been worth all the grief I’d have got from Mary. It would probably have cost our marriage. We weren’t exactly living in wedded bliss. Not by a long chalk. Our marriage had been on shaky ground for years, but I’m just too lazy to do anything about it. Like a lot of fellas I know, I’m what you could call happily, unhappily married. I should have left Mary – and Les – long ago. Now it was too late; I couldn’t face the hassle. Years ago I almost did. I wasn’t so stuck in my ways in those days. I had started an affair. Who hadn’t? All the lads were at it. Sheila was divorced and worked in the control room. Six months we’d been seeing each other and I was seriously thinking about leaving Mary and moving in with Sheila. If Mary suspected, she never let on. Les knew… naturally. Les knows everything. But he never said a word. Then one day, out of the blue, Sheila left the brigade. She said her new job paid more, had better prospects. I wondered if Les had something to do with it. Sheila denied it. Anyway after that we didn’t see each other as much and the relationship kind of fizzled out. After that I had the odd one night stand, but never anything serious. When I took the leader’s job, I made myself a vow that I’d do whatever it took to make a success of it and once and for all crawl from under Les’ shadow. For a brief time it looked like all my efforts had paid off. The Herald report was only half the story; it failed to reveal how the team was a victim of its own success. ""We’ve won praise from the Home Office for reducing fires to the lowest level for a decade - for all the good it’ll do us,"" Les said, his voice bitter. ""This could mean job cuts or the team… "" He pulled his right hand across his throat in a slashing movement. It was catch 22; the more fires, the more money the government forked out. I knew there would have to be some belt tightening, but I’d never dreamed the team might be axed. The taste of success turned sour in my mouth. A picture of Mary thumbing through brochures looking for a holiday to celebrate our silver wedding flashed into my head. ""I want to go somewhere really exotic,"" she announced. ""Somewhere that’ll make the neighbours green with envy."" Then there was Susan’s wedding in the autumn. ""I want a real flash do,"" Mary insisted. ""Give the neighbours something to really talk about."" I looked away. I knew it still rankled that I’d nearly been demoted for being drunk on duty. Not a day went by without Mary reminding me it was Les who’d saved my job. That was nine years ago. I’ve never touched another drop since. And as wave after wave of cuts hit the brigade I had to cling on by my fingernails, knowing all the time it was my father-in-law’s influence that continued to save me. I was in the King’s Arms the night after the press conference announcing the Task Force’s first year report. ""Saw you on the telly,"" my mate Bob said. ""At this rate you’ll be out of a job."" My face must have shown my concern because he added, ‘Hey, don’t look so worried. I was only joking."" I told Bob about the funding situation. ""My squad might be disbanded."" I gulped down a mouthful of orange juice. ""I feel like starting fires myself to push the number up."" I was worried sick. In her drive to impress the neighbours Mary spent money like we had our own personal printing machine. I thought about our overdraft all the time. The Task Force had to survive. Although I hadn’t wanted the job at first, I had got used to the increased salary. I needed the extra dosh to keep up with Mary’s constant spending. Also I had worked my balls off to make it a success and I wanted to prove I didn’t need Les behind me all the time. Now it looked as though it was all a waste of time. It didn’t take the government number crunchers long to break the bad news. The ink was hardly dry on the first year report when the letter arrived announcing that funding was being reduced. Rumours about job losses were rife, but nobody knew how many would go. A budget meeting was called for the following month and a delegation was going to Whitehall to lobby ministers. Until a decision was made, work went on as usual. The school summer holidays had started so my daily school visits to educate youngsters on the dangers of starting fires was over until September. But there was still plenty to do, talking to residents, community groups and youths clubs; hammering home the fire prevention message. The first in a spate of arson attacks began days into the school holidays. A supermarket was the first to go up. Two days later a comprehensive school’s science block was left a blackened shell. Next a mountain of tyres was set on fire. Bored school kids were blamed. The fires were in different parts of the brigade’s area and there was nothing to link them… not then. I was called in to investigate. ""At this rate we’ll not have to worry about losing funding,"" Les snapped irritably, when he came over for tea on Thursday. He’d been coming every Thursday since Mary’s mother died three years ago. ""What’s the latest on the funding?"" I asked, between mouthfuls of cottage pie. Les looked up from helping himself to seconds. ""Don’t ask me, I’m only the Chief,"" he said, shortly. ""You sly bastard,"" I thought. Nothing escaped Les. He knew how every penny was spent - even down to the last paper clip. He knew every firefighter under his command and every dodge they were up to because he’d invented most of them. Mary scowled. ""Oh, don’t talk shop you two, you do it every week. I get it every day from Sam, without getting a double helping on Thursday."" She was wearing another new dress. ""She thinks we’re made of bloody money?"" I thought about the overdraft and my stomach turned to acid. ""Dad, wait till I show you where I’ve chosen for our silver wedding,"" she added. Before the month was out, my team had six more arsons to probe. They included two factory units, a cash and carry warehouse, a redundant church, school gym and an office block. They all made front-page news in the Herald. ""Looks like you won’t have to start any fires because someone’s beaten you to it,"" Bob said, when we next met up in the King’s Arms. I’d forgotten the remark I’d made weeks before. ""What the Hell are you on about?"" I demanded. ""OK. Don’t lose your hair."" Bob chuckled but looked at me strangely. Les constantly demanded progress on the investigations and he was annoyed when the police forensic experts came up with the breakthrough first. They found traces of the same accelerant at all the fires. Les wanted a lid kept on the information because he didn’t want the public to be panicked about a serial arsonist on the loose. He was furious when a reporter ferreted out the information and it made headline news. Soon there was speculation where the arsonist would strike next. People didn’t have to wait long to find out. Days later another school was hit. This time the fire tore through the whole building. Sixty firefighters battled all night in vain to save it. Never slow to leap onto something that could boost sales, the Herald put a £1,000 reward on the arsonist’s head. ""I want this bugger found fast,"" Les growled the following Thursday teatime. ""I don’t want some little sod spoiling my record for me when I retire in a couple of months."" ""If anyone can turn this to their advantage, you can,"" I thought. He’d make sure he went out in a blaze of glory. Over Mary’s toad-in-the hole, we watched the news and a grim-faced Les saying: ""We’re closely monitoring the incidents of arson in the area, and our message to arsonists is clear - your actions will not be tolerated."" News of the fire epidemic and the hunt for the fire starter screamed from newspapers, television and radio. Everywhere I heard people talking about it and there was no shortage of speculation about who was responsible. Suspects questioned over previous incidents were pulled in by police and news leaked out about two others quizzed by detectives. I knew them both. Tony Adamson lived in my street. He had been sacked from the supermarket a week before it burned down. He felt he’d been unfairly treated and one night when drunk he’d been overheard threatening to get even, if it was the last thing he did. Another suspect was a local teenager called Danny Bleacher, who’d served time in a youth offender’s institution for a string of arson attacks on schools. I had given evidence at his trial where a psychiatrist described him as having a morbid fascination for fires. He said they gave him a bigger kick than any drug. He’d started with hoax calls and cut his teeth on rubbish fires. He was eventually caught because he liked to watch the schools burn. A few days before I’d read an interview Danny had given to the Herald. ""People are saying I did it,"" he said. ""I didn’t. I started fires when I was young and stupid. I’m not proud of that but I’ve served my time and learned my lesson. My mum’s ill, she needs me. It would kill her if I went back inside."" The police had no evidence to hold Tony or Danny and they were released without any charges being brought. Soon after, a fresh rumour began circulating. Whoever started the fires had specialist knowledge, it said. So now the public finger was pointed at a firefighter. After two weeks of fire frenzy, there was a lull for a week. The jungle drum said the arsonist had been caught on close circuit television and the police were closing in. There were the usual stories in the local rag about there not being enough bobbies on the beat. This pleased Les because it took some of the flak away from the brigade. I’d been away for a few days on a course, and came home to find Mary had been on another spending spree. With the trip to Bali coming up, it was the last straw. ""For God’s sake, Mary, we’re not made of money,’ I said crossly. ""I might not have a job after tomorrow’s budget meeting."" ""You’ve got nothing to worry about."" ""Have you been talking to Les?"" I demanded. ""He’s my dad and your boss, if I want him to help us, you can’t blame me."" ""Besides,"" she shrugged her shoulders, brown from a series of tanning sessions, ""with all these arsons, they’ll need an arson task force, you said so yourself."" I shook my head. ""We’ll just have to wait and see."" I wasn’t sure which way the meeting would swing. The brigade was facing a crisis. But one more big fire might convince the politicians to keep the task force. After tea Mary flounced out saying she was going to the bingo, hopefully to win the jackpot, then she could buy some new clothes for Bali with a clean conscience. I looked at her wondering when the rot had started to set in. When had I let Mary and Les take over my life? I didn’t hate her. I just didn’t love her any more. It wasn’t the kind of stuff I could talk to my mates about. And Susan was out of the question. She’d inherited Mary and Les’ ruthless streak for getting her own way no matter at whose expense. It was sad, but already her girlish prettiness was fading. She had Mary’s hard-as-nails look. I wondered if her boyfriend Steve knew what he was in for. Poor sod. There was only one person I could speak to. Bruno. He was the only one who understood. On our walks twice a day, I’d tell him all my marital problems. He’d listen quietly like a marriage counsellor, giving a sympathetic wag of the tail every now and again. After going for my nightly marriage guidance session with Bruno, I was driving my car to meet Bob for a drink when my bleeper went off. I could see the blaze from half a dozen streets away, and hear the scream of fire appliances coming from all directions. I turned and drove towards Belford Street. Flames were shooting from the ceiling and windows of the DIY and garden centre and clouds of thick black smoke belched hundreds of yards into the sky. I counted at least seven fire appliances and more were arriving every few minutes. As I got out of the car I heard the roof tiles cracking. Sweaty-faced firefighters trained jets on the ground floor while another crew on a turntable ladder battled to douse the upper floor. Amid the shouted orders and roar of the fire, I heard windows smashing. High winds fanned the flames towards a compound containing cylinders and barrels. A crew blasted water on them to keep them cool. I was here as an observer so I kept out of the way. A crowd had gathered and was being kept well back behind a cordon by police officers. I panned the faces of the onlookers and settled on the features of Danny Bleacher. Suddenly there was a loud explosion. There was a collective gasp from the crowd and several people screamed. I tore my eyes away from Danny and back to the blaze in time to see a fireball shoot 100ft into the air like a rocket. Shouting broke out and firefighters ran for cover. I watched the fireball hurtle back towards the ground. It was one of the cylinders. It smashed onto the bonnet of a car, which exploded like a bomb had hit it. There were several smaller explosions as barrels overheated and ruptured, spewing out oil. Within seconds a river of burning oil ran down the street, exploding the petrol tanks of parked cars and melting their tyres as it went. Crews battled to hold back the flow as police evacuated residents from nearby houses. The air reeked with the acrid smell of burning rubber, kerosene, smoke and sweat. I watched the crews working to bring the blaze under control and felt proud to be one of them. I moaned about the pay and the long hours, but deep down I love the job. Politicians talk about cutting edge equipment and pioneering schemes, but at the end of the day it comes down to guts. ""I want everyone well back,"" I heard Divisional Officer Mike Leyland shout. ""The rest of those cylinders are going to go."" A weary fireman, who recognised me, shook his head and said: ""I hope there’s no bugger inside because they won’t stand a chance."" I looked at the blazing building. There wasn’t supposed to be anyone inside at this time of night. I prayed no one was. A fleet of ambulances stood by just in case. The media had turned up and several people with cameras ran around, trying to get the best shot. Then I saw someone being stretchered towards the nearest ambulance. My insides grew cold and tight as I recognized Mary. I bolted for the ambulance. ""That’s my wife,"" I screamed at the paramedics. A paramedic giving Mary oxygen looked at me, surprised. Mary put her hand up to stop the mask going over her face. ""Dad. Dad,"" her voice was a hoarse whisper. ""It's me Mary, Sam."" I was annoyed her first thought was of Les. The paramedic tried to put the mask back over her face but again her hand stopped him. ""Must tell Sam… "" ""We’ve got to get her to hospital,"" the paramedic insisted. ""Let me see her, please,"" I begged and sank to my knees beside the stretcher. I grasped one of her hands. Tears poured down her smoke-blackened face. She started to speak but her voice was growing weaker and I had to put my ear to her mouth. ""He said it was like a drug… "" she croaked. ""Followed him… "" She clutched weakly at my shirt with her free hand. My eyes flickered to the crowd and tried to pick out Danny Bleacher. But the police had pushed the cordon further back and the faces were just a blur. He'd said starting fires was like a drug. He'd also said he'd mended his ways. I had believed him but I guess a leopard doesn't change its spots. ""Tried to stop him… "" Mary whispered. Then her hand slid from my shirt and she was still. The paramedic took her pulse. ""Sorry, she’s gone,"" he said. ""NO!"" I grabbed the mask from the paramedic’s hand and put it over Mary’s face. ""Mary, Mary."" I looked at the paramedic praying he’d tell me she was going to be all right. His mouth was grim. He shook his head. I shut my eyes and our 25 years together flashed through my head like a movie on fast forward. Our first date, Mary so happy on our wedding day, the birth of Susan, all pink wrinkled skin and mop of black hair, Mary smiling and kissing me on just the right spot on the ear that was guaranteed to made me weak at the knees. She hadn’t done that for a long time. An unbearable ache surrounded my chest and I found it difficult to breath. Tears stung my eyes. I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked up into the paramedic’s face. ""Do you want to ride with her to the hospital?"" he asked. I stood up and shook my head. I don’t know how long I stood there. Time seemed to stand still. I never heard the ambulance take Mary’s body away or the clamour of the firefighting operation around me. I was suddenly seized with panic. I realised that despite our differences I still loved Mary. ""What am I going to do without you?"" I sobbed. My legs trembled and I felt like I was going to collapse. I felt light-headed and dizzy. I don’t know how long I stood like that. Suddenly I was jerked from my trance by a hand clawing at my shoulder. I turned and looked into Les’ blurred face. ""Sam, listen carefully,’ he said, his voice urgent. My brain refused to function. ""Sam are you listening? This is what happened. Mary was passing, she saw Danny Bleacher running from the factory and heard a scream from inside__"" I started to speak, but he waved an impatient hand. ""I won’t have Mary’s name dragged through the mud. I can’t afford any scandals so close to my retirement."" The fog in my head was lifting. I stared at him in disbelief. The man actually thought his own daughter was the arsonist. ""He’s scum,"" he said. ""Prison’s the best place for the likes of him."" He put a hand on my shoulder again. ""Now listen to me, Sam, this is what I want you to say. She heard a scream, she thought someone was trapped and she went in to rescue them."" His grip on my shoulder tightened. ""You owe me, Sam. If it weren’t for Mary and me you’d have been all washed up 10 years ago. Remember where your loyalties lie."" He was right. I did owe them. After splitting up from Sheila I had started to drink heavily. One day I was drunk on duty. An instant sacking offence. But Les had pulled strings and saved my job. He and Mary had held me to emotional blackmail ever since. It always amazed me how I had the guts to go into a blazing building but never had the balls to say no to Mary and Les. Take Sheila, for instance. I had loved Sheila, loved being with her. She made me feel like my old self. I should have fought for her. But it was easier to let her go. Less hassle. Les was growing impatient. ""Or are you going to be spineless, as usual?"" he hissed. I flinched like I’d been punched in the face. What hurt more was that it was true. He hadn’t tried to disguise the scorn in his voice. He despised me for not being like him, a ruthless, self-obsessed, arrogant bastard. He’d tolerated me all these years for Mary’ sake. Well, the feeling was mutual. ""If you don’t back me up, I’ll make sure you’re out of a job,"" he said, his steel grey eyes, flickering with anger. ""I’ve only a few months to go, but if it’s the last thing I do I’ll make sure you’re all washed up."" Tom Waugh, Delta’s station officer came up and coughed. ""Chief, the press know about your… eh… daughter. I don’t know how, sir, but they’ve heard. They want you to give an interview. Insensitive bastards. I’ve told them you’re too upset__"" ""It’s all right,"" Les said, interrupting him. ""Give me a minute to compose myself and I’ll be over."" Tom Waugh walked away. Les looked at me. ""Remember what I said."" I watched him walk towards the waiting group of reporters. My eyes swung towards the crowd of onlookers in time to see Danny being pushed into a car by two men I recognised as detectives. I looked back at Les. The reporters were all shouting questions at him at the same time. He put his hand up to quieten them. ""I’ve got a short statement to make,"" he told them. ""We’ve been able to piece together what happened from what my daughter told her husband, before… "" He paused and coughed. He was in full uniform and his brass buttons gleamed under the television camera lights. ""My daughter was a hero."" Our eyes locked over the reporters’ heads. His were cold, confident, knowing I would do exactly what he wanted, as usual. And he was right. I was spineless. I didn’t have the bottle to take him on. ""We’re proud of her,"" he said, giving the press his full attention once again. ""She was passing when she saw someone running from the burning factory. She was about to call the brigade when she heard a scream from inside and dashed in to try and mount a rescue. Tragically, she became trapped herself.’’ I felt sick. I shook my head and turned away. I was desperate for a drink. ""Firefighting has been my life,"" I heard Les continue, ""it’s been like a drug. Now I’m ready to retire."" I stopped dead. Mary’s words came back to me. ""He said it was like a drug."" I spun around to look at Les. ""Now, if you’ll excuse me I’ve matters of a personal nature to attend to,"" Les said. He gave a curt nod and walked away. A barrage of questions was fired after him. ""That’s all for now,"" Station Officer Waugh said, stepping forward. ""There’ll be a press conference in the morning."" I watched Les walk away. What sort of man was he, who’d send an innocent lad to prison to protect his bloody image? I knew he wanted to go out in a blaze of glory but I never dreamed he could be so ruthless. His words came back. ""You owe me, Sam. If it weren’t for Mary and me you’d have been all washed up 10 years ago. Remember where your loyalties lie."" I took a deep breath. I owed him nothing. For 25 bloody years I’d danced to his tune. No more. I couldn't prove it but I knew that Les had started the fires. And I'd find the evidence if it took me the rest of my life. My accusations would force the brigade to suspend him and carry out an investigation. Even if they cleared him, the mud would stick. The press pack was about to move off. I squared my shoulders and hurried over. I hadn’t felt so in-control in years. ""Before you go,"" I said, ""I’ve a statement of my own to make."" ",candidate00001
1,00002,candidate00001,"There he was again; motionless, like he was chiselled out of the stone that towered over the centre of the maze. He looked around 70 and despite the heatwave, wore the same raincoat buttoned tightly up to his chin. He stood in exactly the same spot, just as he had done every Sunday for the past month. Each week the feeling that I knew him from somewhere had grown, but I couldn’t remember where. He’d never spoken to me. In fact, he didn’t even seem to notice me. It was like he was locked in his own little world and I was invisible. Today I was in no rush to get back home, so I approached him. I coughed. ""Excuse me, but do I know you?"" Blank eyes looked at me. ""Leave me alone,"" he said in a dull voice. My face burned with embarrassment and anger. I turned to weave my way back along the winding green-walled path, but some instinct stopped me. Or was it because his voice sounded inexplicably familiar? ""Is there anything I can do?"" I asked for want of anything more imaginative to say. He was hunched in the shadow of the stone mound. ""Why do you want to know?"" He sounded disinterested as if he didn’t care if I answered or not. I didn’t know what to say. I groped for words. ""I sense… I sense you need help."" He looked at me for the first time. His eyes sharpened beneath erratic eyebrows. ""You’re right, I do need to tell someone,"" he said softly. ""But I warn you, you’ll probably think I’m mad."" His attempt at a smile failed. ""I’ve lost my soul,"" he said simply. I looked at him bewildered. ""That’s why I come here, hoping to find it again."" I don’t know what I expected… not this… it was too weird. I shook my head and turned away. ""Don’t go,"" he cried, clutching my wrist with icy fingers. ""I didn’t mean to frighten you. I told you, didn’t I? I said you’d think I was mad."" ""I don’t think you’re mad,"" I lied, avoiding his gaze. My eyes fixed on his scuffed black brogues with the laces undone. ""But I don’t know how I can help you."" He released my wrist. ""Just listen,"" he pleaded, ""that’s all I ask."" I nodded without replying. I wanted to run but he sounded so wretched, a voice in my head told me to hear him out. ""It happened so long ago. More than 50 years. You wouldn’t think to look at this place now,"" he gestured with a bony hand to the neglected hedges, overgrown and sagging, and the graffiti that daubed the maze’s granite boulder centrepiece, ""but it used to be lovely. For years it’s been abandoned. I used to come here every Sunday afternoon with my wife Mary. She used to make us a picnic and we would lay a cloth on the grass outside."" His sad face brightened at the memory. ""It’s a mess now, but it used to have beautiful flower beds."" I looked around trying to visualise this forsaken place echoing with the laughter of picnicking families. ""My world stopped one particular Sunday."" The lines that streaked his face ran deep, like the fissures etched in the stone. ""We’d finished our picnic and went for a walk through the maze. We knew it so well, we could have found our way in and out blindfolded. Mary wanted to climb the boulder and see what the view was like from up there. I told her it was too high, too dangerous. I was tidying away the picnic things when I heard a scream. When I looked up Mary was hanging from the rock by her fingertips. She’d climbed up while I wasn’t looking."" His lip trembled. ""I scrambled up as fast as I could."" I’m frightened of heights and as I looked at the bleak stone, I felt the hairs rise on the back of my neck. His grey haunted eyes remained locked on the stone as he continued. ""I can still see the relief in her eyes when she saw me. I leaned over as far as I could. My arm was stretching out of its socket. My hand only inches away. I reached even further. I shouted to her to grab my hand. She tried. Oh God… "" He sobbed and dashed a bloodless hand through his lank grey hair. ""She made no sound but I could see tears running down her lovely face."" His voice sank to a whisper and I strained to catch his words. ""Then her face twisted with terror as her hands slipped and fell. I lost my balance and toppled over the side after her."" My breath caught in my throat. ""Have you heard of people who’ve had near death experiences?"" He was calmer now. ""Yes, I’ve read about it,"" I replied, giving him an uneasy look. ""Mary died in the fall. I lay beside her. I knew I was seriously injured, but I didn’t care. I was angry with Mary for climbing the mound, angry with myself because I couldn’t save her and angry with God for allowing it to happen."" He paused and took a long deep breath, then said: ""That’s when I died."" I stared at him aghast. ""I’m not mad,"" he said quickly. ""It’s true. Please let me finish,"" he implored. I wanted to tear myself away but couldn’t. And reluctantly nodded. ""All my pain disappeared."" His eyes, huge in his chalky face, burned into mine. ""There was a bright light in the distance. It drew nearer and nearer, until it bathed me in a luminescent glow."" Icy fingers of sweat crept over my body as I listened. ""I had a wonderful feeling of peace,"" he went on, his eyes shining with an intense light. ""I could see my broken body below as I floated in a bubble of shimmering light."" His voice got higher and he spoke faster. I was frightened but unable to pull my eyes from his hypnotic gaze. ""I was being pulled along a tunnel to the source of the light,"" he said, breathlessly. ""It was glorious. Two Beings of Light were waiting to greet me, and Mary was standing between them. I’d almost reached the source, when a voice said I must go back. It wasn’t my time."" He reached out and grabbed my sleeve. ""I didn’t want to. I had no choice. I was sent."" My heart ached for this stranger. ""When I woke in hospital, I was angry, angrier than I’ve ever been."" His face was grim. ""I didn’t want to be here. I felt I didn’t belong. I wanted to be with Mary."" I took a deep breath. ""I’ve read that when people are given a second chance, life becomes precious,"" I said, trying to reassure him and give him a crumb of comfort. ""Mary wouldn’t want you to be unhappy. She’d want___"" His eyes blazed. ""Life’s empty without Mary. I don’t belong."" I didn’t know what to say to ease his pain. ""I don’t understand,"" I said, feebly. ""That Sunday, I didn’t die but my soul never returned. It somehow became trapped in this maze."" His bone-white hands, criss-crossed with blue veins, trembled. ""I don’t know how. All I know is I’m alive, but this body… "" he pointed down at himself, ""is just a shell. Every Sunday afternoon I come here, hoping… "" his voice cracked. ""I’m in limbo,"" he said, ""detached… floundering between two worlds… belonging to neither."" ""I want to help you, but I don’t know how?"" ""When I recognised you, I knew you would."" ""What… "" my voice trembled, ""what do you mean?"" ""Remember the Beings of Light at the end of the tunnel."" I nodded. ""You were with them."" ""I… I don’t understand."" ""You’re Mary."" I put my hand to my mouth and looked at him in horrified disbelief. Then turned and ran. ""Please, come back."" His cry echoed after me as I fled the maze. All week at work I couldn’t forget him. I read every thing I could on near death experiences and reincarnation, but couldn’t find the answers to the questions that twirled in my head like washing in a dryer. Could I have been Mary? Is that why he was so familiar to me? Is that why I’m frightened of heights, because I fell from one in another life? I told myself I was being ridiculous. I’d found the maze by accident. It was neglected and not very interesting. I had far better things to do with my Sundays but for some reason I couldn’t fathom, I kept going back week after week. Now I was wondering if it hadn’t been an accident after all. What if destiny had drawn me there. But I was determined not to go back again. Then when Sunday afternoon came around, I couldn’t settle. All I could think of was the old man in the maze, longing to be with his Mary. The following week was the same. I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep. I was a mess, a wreck. My behaviour was the last straw for Joe. For months he’d been asking me to marry him. I was happy just living together. I was so fixated on the old man that I hardly noticed he’d left. My obsession took over everything. I thought about the old man every second. I knew I had to help him. I found out all I could about the maze and made a startling discovery. The stone came from a quarry where there’d been a murder, almost a century ago. The following Sunday I returned to the maze. The old man was there as I knew he would be. He looked different, not so neglected. His clothes were still much the worse for wear but his untidy hair had been cut and was neatly combed. His laces were still undone but his shoes had been buffed to a high shine. I told him what I’d found. ""What if your soul is trapped by the tormented spirit of the man who was murdered?"" ""I don’t know what you mean?"" he whispered in confusion. ""I’m not an expert. But just say, when the stone was brought here from the quarry, the victim’s ghost… spirit… whatever you want to call it, came with it."" He still looked puzzled. I pressed on. ""It might be lonely and so trapped your soul for company."" His raincoat was too big for his shrunken frame and hung on him like a canvas tent. There was a crust of blood on his chin where he’d nicked himself shaving. The razor-raw pain was still in his eyes, eating my insides. Night after night over the past two weeks I’d reconstructed the events of that tragic Sunday. I’d seen Mary’s tears and terror-twisted face. I prayed my wild plan would work. ""I’ve an idea,"" I told him. ""If we take some of the stone back to the quarry, the ghost may go back with it."" ""What good would that do? I still won’t have my Mary,"" he persisted. His cheerless face was so pinched, red-hot tears stung my eyes. ""I know, "" I said sadly ""But it may let you be reunited with your soul. It has to be better than living like this… in limbo."" There was such torment in his eyes. I put my arms around his fleshless shoulders and hugged him. The smell of Brylcream tickled my nostrils. ""I don’t understand any of this,"" I said in a low voice, ""but I know I was meant to help you. Let’s try."" My eyes implored him. ""Please."" Reluctantly he agreed. We came back that night with the pickaxe, I’d borrowed. He was too weak, so I had to do it. It was tough but determination gave me strength. We took a large chunk of stone to the quarry. I’m not religious, but as we stood in that desolate place I said a little prayer. I hoped it would help both these suffering spirits. ""What now?"" he asked when we got back in the maze. ""Lie down exactly where you were after you fell."" He didn’t move. ""It can’t do any harm. Please,"" I urged. His eyes softened as he looked at me. ""First I want you to have this for trying to help me."" He handed me a gold locket. ""I gave it to Mary on our wedding day. She’d want you to have it. We’d planned to have children and I know she would have loved a daughter like you."" He patted my face and I caught his fragile hand in mine, squeezing it gently. ""Whatever happens my dear it’s been a pleasure meeting you,"" he added. I couldn’t answer for the tears choking me. I watched him lie down. He closed his eyes and lay still. Nothing happened, then as I watched, his face became illuminated and transformed, wiping away all traces of pain and despair. He looked 50 years younger. He raised his arms as if in welcome, gave a gasp and was still. I hurried over and felt for a pulse. There wasn’t one. There was a look of utter peace on his face. He was reunited with his soul and his beloved Mary. Tears of sorrow and joy rolled down my face. I felt I’d lost part of myself but I was grateful for the short time I’d had with him. It had changed my life. I now knew why I was frightened to commit to Joe. I loved him too much. I had some unexplainable fear that I’d lose him. Now I was ready to say ""yes"", if he’d have me. I brushed the old man’s thin face with my lips, fastened his shoelaces, then opened the heart-shaped locket. Inside were two black and white pictures. One was the old man as the young handsome newlywed I’d imagined him to be. The other was a picture of the woman who had haunted my dreams - my grandmother’s twin sister. I'd never known her. She had died tragically young and I never knew the circumstances. But for some unknown reason from being very little I had always felt drawn to her. Maybe because I was named after her and older members of the family said I reminded them of her. Slowly I walked home and reported finding the body to the police. ",candidate00001
2,00001,candidate00002,"The sudden silence halted his struggle against the weight pinning him. With his left arm trapped by its weight, he couldn’t gain the leverage to move the cabinet. The growing numbness in his legs, also pinned, offered scant hope that they’d be joining the effort. As the last sound of battle choked away in the next room, his gaze swept around as much of his surroundings as his limited vantage allowed. Night had barely begun to fall, yet the place was shrouded in shadows, along with the layers of dust or dirt, the heavy curtains set to keep the place dark through the daylight hours. His own weapon had skidded out of reach, and those of the fallen he could make out in the dull light were all too far away. He had a stake still in his belt, but on the wrong side, out of reach. Even as his gaze swept over the bodies surrounding him, he knew he’d spot no signs of life, or movement, from them. Both his team and their prey lay strewn about, their strategy having gone bad quicker than he’d have thought possible. While they’d tried to adapt when they realised they were expected, it had already been too late. He briefly considered changing himself, the greater strength of his wolf form increasing his chances of his freeing himself, but being so new to all this, he knew he’d lack the necessary control when he changed, and worried that the wolf would just lash out blindly, damaging itself as much as the cabinet. But if the survivor of the fight next door proved not to be one of his, he may have little choice. His eyes fixed on the doorway now occupied by the survivor, a shape which didn’t bring any relief. The outlines of a long coat drifted behind as it stepped into the less murky darkness, identifying the form as definitely not being a member of his team. It moved towards him with a casual step, taking a roundabout path, but he knew he was the target of the stranger’s attention, so playing dead would do no good. He tensed, hurriedly running through his dwindling options, giving the cabinet a final, fruitless, shove. “Is da poor widdle doggy twapped?” The voice held an aloof amusement at his struggle, which immediately set his nerves further on edge. Abandoning his attempt to shift the cabinet, he focussed his attention on the figure’s movements. “Don’t bother trying to rise, Jason.” The man glided closer, his elegant movements a match for his tone. “I assure you there’s no need for formality.” Jason didn’t bother hiding his suspicion. “Yes,” said the looming figure. “I know who you are. I’m an old friend of your father.” A dubious glare greeted this proclamation. The stranger inclined his head slightly. “Well, maybe not friend, but we did try to kill each other on a fairly regular basis.” Smiling, he sat near Jason’s prone position, offering the first real view of his face. The features confirmed the suspicions his words had raised. “Adam Vaage.” Adam inclined his head in greeting. “A pleasure to finally make your acquaintance.” Jason stayed silent, his gaze flickering to the blade twirling between Adam’s fingers. What he could make out of the carvings on its ebon hilt matched those he’d seen in pictures of it, and the faintly curved blade glinted a threatening shade of silver. “I suppose you’re wondering…” Adam glanced about as he began speaking, and Jason took advantage of the apparent distraction to dart his hand for the knife, just within reach. Adam didn’t even glance back as his grip on the weapon instantly shifted, its blade snapping around to greet Jason’s hand. His hand flinched back, and Jason held back his pain as best he could, the sting of the slash cascaded into a jolt of agony as the silver boiled his blood where it cut. It took a moment to suppress the waves of agony as the burning slowly died away. Looking up, he saw Adam finish his survey and glance down at him with a wearied smile. “If you’ve quite gotten that out of your system? Good. Now please don’t worry, I have no intention of doing anything to you. Not at this time, leastways. I’d hardly have invited you here if I did, now would I?” “You invited us!?” Jason made no attempt to hide his doubt. “Who do you think gave your people the tip about this nest of unaffiliated vampires?” Jason glanced about at the dead, or rather inanimate, vampires. Their clothes and generally shabby appearance were a marked contrast to Adam. “This wasn’t your nest. You didn’t have anything to do with them, did you?” “Oh, please don’t mistake me for one of these suckers? Living… here?” He glanced about again, with obvious distaste. “I didn’t mistake you for something living anywhere.” A more genuine smile greeted him this time. “No, I had nothing to do with them, other than selecting them as a suitable target for your people, and warning them of your attack a couple of minutes beforehand.” “Why?” “Why set them up, or why tip them off?” “Either.” “To allow us to meet, of course.” His bewilderment openly displayed, Jason took a moment before replying. “And now that we’ve met? What are you going to do to me?” “Do to you?” False shock overwhelmed him. “Why, whatever kind of monster must you take me for?” “A blood-sucking abomination of nature.” An indifferent shrug conceded the point. “Who has no intention of doing anything other than leaving you for your back-up units to rescue.” “So why go to all this trouble?” Adam met his gaze before looking about again. “You know, I do miss your father. Did he ever tell you about our fights?” “No.” Adam glanced back at Jason. “Never?” Jason kept his tone steady, but couldn’t quite hide his unease at the path of the conversation. “No.” Adam shrugged. “I enjoyed those. It is so rare to find a decent enemy these days. Someone you can actually respect. Then he met your mother, left the life, became a…” he glanced up, searching for the word. “Pedestrian, I suppose. And he died a pedestrian death.” He dropped his gaze to meet Jason’s. “Of that I am truly sorry.” Keeping his features firmly fixed, Jason offered no response. “So then I hear that you’ve joined the Hunt, and I just knew I had to meet you, to see whether you could possibly live up to your father.” He ran a disappointedly appraising glance over Jason. “But I suppose you are still new to the game, so I’ll give you some time to grow into it.” Rising, Adam looked down at Jason. “So, what? Because you and my father were enemies, now we are, too?” “Oh, we’re not enemies, Jason. Not yet, anyway. We’ve only just met, and I’ve yet to find something admirable about you.” “Admirable?” “Of course. One must always admire something about one’s enemies. Otherwise they’re not really enemies. They’re just obstacles.” With a smile he turned to leave. “That’s it?” Jason glanced around. “Everyone here killed, or rekilled, just so we could meet?” “And for the fun of it.” Adam flashed a grin as he turned and strode away. “You be a good little doggy now.” Jason bit back a retort as Adam faded into the darkened doorway, the sound of his departure quickly overwhelmed by that of the back-up team moving through the building. The wolf fought for release. He felt it struggling against his hold as his mind embraced the change. A torrent of rage broke against him, and he strained to keep it in check, to maintain his focus. Running through the meditation techniques he’d been taught, he found the waves of sheer aggression almost too overwhelming, always clawing for his attention. Uncertain of his ability to hold it back any longer, he released his grip on the change and pushed the wolf back down inside. He forced his mental processes to calm, recalling happier memories to help his mind relax. Inevitably, he went back to the time before he’d been forced into this world, when he was still in college, with Sophia. His thoughts calmer, he pushed the memory away, intending to find a new memory with which to relax himself next time. This one just reminded him too much of what he’d had to leave behind. Opening his eyes, Jason realized he’d been shaking with the strain, and noticed the sweat trickling over him. Taking a deep breath to calm himself, he suppressed his irritation. Coming so late to this, he lacked the control those more experienced with the techniques could manage, so he couldn’t safely assume the full wolf form without the rage taking over, let alone manage the more useful hybrid stage. His lack of control made him a liability on intensive combat missions, so he’d found himself generally limited to investigative jobs. Which held a certain interest, but he still felt as though he should be doing more. Stretching his back and neck, he turned as he heard movement at the doorway, the sounds of the pubic part of the building drifting through. Ostensibly a gym, serving the nearby financial district, the Clans owned the place, and at least a third of the floor space was restricted for their use, either single exercise rooms like this, or larger ones for group combat training. Having recognized his uncle’s barely discernible tread before he turned to regard him, Jason eased himself to his feet, coming to attention. “Jason.” Robert Miller came to a stop just before the practice mats. He exchanged a cursory nod with the trainer seated off to Jason’s side, the taser at hand as he supervised the exercise. Jason no longer found himself as put off by the presence as he initially had. Everyone had to have a supervisor when learning the control exercises, and he found the presence now eased his concerns that he’d lose control of the change. The anxiety itself seemed to make concentrating on his control harder, so after the first few sessions the supervisor had become a reassuring safety net, rather than an imposing observer. Robert focussed his attention on Jason, a quick glance seeming to take in how the session had gone. “I have a job for you. I’m afraid it’s urgent, so I’ll need you to cut short the session.” Jason nodded. “Should I grab a quick shower first or do you want to brief me here?” “Get cleaned up and presentable, but don’t take too long. I’ve got a car with me and I’ll brief you on the way. I’ll wait outside.” Robert said nothing as Jason entered the car, waiting until he’d pulled them into the flow of traffic before turning to his nephew. “Have you heard about Councillor Reilly?” Jason gave a slight nod. “I heard he was found dead this morning. There’s a rumour going around he was murdered. Someone said it could have been a vamp, but that kind of claim isn’t exactly unusual.” Robert grimaced. “He was found dead early this morning. It looks like murder. But there’s nothing I’m aware of to indicate vampires, so please don’t go repeating the rumour. In fact, since you’ll be investigating, you should keep any information about the murder between us.” Jason nodded. “Will it just be me looking into it?” “You’ll be lead. How much do you know about Reilly?” “He was a Council member. And a businessman. He ran some of the Clan’s companies. That’s about it, I think. I don’t know that I’ve ever met him.” “Probably not.” Robert glanced at Jason. “He was also heavily involved in the peace talks.” A definite hint of something seemed to flick across Jason’s eyes at this. “Peace talks in which the Council are heavily invested, and which they wish to see continue, so this murder is highly politically charged, and needs to be resolved quickly, hopefully without too many rumours spreading about vampire involvement.” “And if there turns out to be vampire involvement?” Robert exhaled slowly. “Then we’ll deal with that when it occurs, but I need you to approach the case with an open mind. I don’t want you going into this looking for a vampire killer.” He pulled a folder from beside his seat and handed it over. Taking it, Jason nodded, opening it and scanning the contents. Robert had hoped his relative newness to this world would give Jason less inbred animosity toward vampires than others he could have assigned, but there were increasingly larger elements of the clans who had more certain views towards their ancestral enemy, and he wasn’t too sure how much of an influence they may have over Jason. There were probably a few members of the Hunt who shared those views, anyway. Nevertheless, he didn’t expect the following news to be greeted too warmly. “Due to the nature of the current political situation, you’ll have to work alongside an agent from the other side of the talks.” Jason’s eyes barely flickered as he met Robert’s, but there’d definitely been something there. “You mean a vampire!?” “Yes.” “Why? If this doesn’t have anything to do with…” “Because the Councils have decided that this investigation deserves close scrutiny, due to the potentially explosive effect rumours could have if allowed free rein. We don’t need premature retaliatory strikes setting off another war, so the situation is to be closely supervised.” Jason turned to stare out the window. “Who am I working with, then? Someone from the Order?” “Not sure, but I don’t think so. They’ll just be there to observe, and I suspect the Order will have someone else conducting their own investigation out of sight, so if the killer does turn out to be one of them, they’ll hope to get to them first.” “That’s assuming their Council isn’t behind it and haven’t already cleared away any incriminating evidence.” “Assuming that, yes. Still, working with them means we get access to the vampire Council’s assets in the police, so we’ll get their findings quickly, and they’ll be prompted to treat this as a priority case. We’ll also get access to the murder scene.” Jason looked back to the file in his hands. “Do we know if he had any business enemies from outside the communities?” “None that I know of, but I’ll be debriefing some of the senior staff, and I’ll let you know if that raises anything relevant. Although he did apparently have a loud disagreement with one of his associates, just yesterday morning. Leonard Markham, the Director of Acquisitions and Mergers at the company. I’ve got him available for questioning by you, along with Reilly’s secretary, Michelle Grant. They’re both of the Clans.” “Do we have anything else on Markham?” “Nothing of note. What we do have is towards the back,” he gestured offhandedly to the file, “but I’ve skimmed it and nothing there seems particularly relevant. I can have people look at his accounts and background, if you think it worth doing after speaking to him.” Jason nodded, without looking up. “Just those two I’m talking to?” “Given that the company has certain interests in common with those of our fanged friends, the Council are reluctant to have many members of staff questioned in the presence of a potential commercial spy. We’ll have others questioned in-house.” With a snort, Jason turned his attention back to the notes. “So am I just investigating for PR purposes?” “No, you’re the lead. Consider this freeing up your time for the main avenues of investigation. I can also assign manpower to any other areas you want looked at.” “Why me? For something this high profile wouldn’t you be better assigning someone more experienced?” “You’re a good investigator. Apart from which you’re diplomatic…” “Diplomatic?!” “Poker-faced may be a better description. You can keep your cool and keep your feelings hidden, and you’re more even-tempered than some. Since this investigation could lead anywhere in our communities, I need someone who can work it without treading on too many toes than is necessary. Plus, someone more experienced could well have previously made enemies with people you’ll need to talk to. Discrete investigations aren’t exactly what we’re used to.” Jason nodded his acceptance of the reasoning. “What about Reilly’s personal life. Anything not covered by this?” He nudged the file. “Single, I don’t believe he had any long-term relationships, but he enjoyed socializing, and being seen out and about at the big events and popular clubs.” After a quick glance out the window, Jason looked at Robert. “Where are we going? I thought he was murdered at home?” “He was. But the police are all over it at the moment, and since that’s where any forensic evidence would be, it was decided to let their people get what they can from it first.” “Decided by the vampire Council, I assume?” Robert gave a reluctant nod. “So by the time we get there, any scent the killer may have left could be totally obscured.” Robert shrugged. “The police labs will treat the evidence as a priority, and they should be cleared out in time for you to go in soon. Hopefully soon enough to preserve any scents. For the moment, though, we’ll meet Chryles and your new partner at Reilly’s office. We get first look at that.” Jason nodded, closing the folder and putting it aside. “Anything else I should know?” “Just one thing. You’ll be coming over for dinner on Sunday, investigation allowing.” He offered a sheepish shrug of apology. “Mariah insists. You missed Ariadne’s piano recital due to a mission, and she insists on doing a repeat performance for her favourite cousin.” Jason smiled as he turned his attention back to the file. The elevator deposited them onto a mainly deserted floor of offices, a security guard solemnly letting them pass once he’d checked their IDs. A combination of windows and clouded glass, the place felt as though it was intended to be artistic, but Jason just found it irritating. The unnatural quiet blanketing the place didn’t help, as though its corridors were used to far more traffic during the daylight hours. But the floor had been ordered shut off until the police could get to it. A nod from the guard towards the main office at the far end of a long corridor indicated where they’d find company, and the hint of distaste on his face gave a good indication as to the nature of the parties present. Jason walked silently alongside Robert, both composing themselves for the approaching interaction, as they caught faint glimpses of figures through the partly open doorway up ahead. The scents seemed obscured, as though their guests had taken steps to mask themselves out of respect for heightened senses of smell. But there remained a hint of the too-familiar aroma of undeath, which could never quite be hidden. The smell of long-dried death could be tolerated with practice, but it always seemed to put any of the Clan on edge, as though some genetic memory from their ancestors recognized the threat it presaged. He thought he picked up something else mixed with it, something vaguely familiar, but he couldn’t place it. Something about it just felt out of place. He’d only caught a brief whiff, though, barely enough to hold in his mind, so he returned his attention to his mental preparations. The whisper of muted conversation drifted out to meet them, and Jason’s superior hearing soon identified the irritatingly superior tones of Chryles as he lectured his associate. The talking died down as Chryles stepped into view of the open gap between the doors, favouring them with an indifferent nod of greeting. Under the aloof gaze, Jason surreptitiously ran through some breathing techniques, determined to hold his temper, and disgust, in check, and to maintain his composure while in their presence. He hoped the investigation wouldn’t take too long, whatever it uncovered, as he didn’t want to cause any political problems by killing his ‘partner’. He shortened his stride to allow Robert to enter the room first, following behind and coming to a stop alongside him. Chryles' associate turned as they entered, but her scent hit Jason with a torrent of memories before he even saw her face. “Misters Miller,” said Chryles, his tone a slow drawl as he enunciated each word, with no attempt at injecting his voice with any hint of warmth. “May I introduce…” “Sophia!?” Jason couldn’t keep the shock from his voice as his practised calm abandoned him, his face betraying a surprise almost equalled by hers.

3,00002,candidate00002,"Fire really shouldn't take so long to get going, should it? It had been dry a few hours now, yet his opponent had been tending the valuable pile he'd brought with him for five minutes, and Danath was growing anxious to get on with the duel. Or anxious to see whether his opponent could do as the rumours claimed. Focussing on calming his nerves, Danath glanced around the small, roughly circular, plateau. Barely fifty paces wide, with most sides almost sheer. The side they'd ascended had been an awkward climb from sea level, almost forty feet below. Roughly flat, with only a few patches of rock jutting up, its floor of solid stone lay on a slight incline, and the only signs of vegetation covered the sides near the water, becoming sporadic further up. A cool breeze wafted in, and he turned to squint at the sun, letting it wash over his dark skin. Just short of six foot, his lean, muscled form hid behind the loose-fitting trousers and long sleeved grey vest he preferred for duelling. Rain may have offered him an advantage, but potentially less of a challenge, so he was happy it had dried out. Never losing track of his opponent's movements, he scanned the horizon, which offered a small number of similar peaks jutting out of the sea to varying heights. And, of course, Melmyrn, his home city, floating nearby. Its path had been diverted here for this duel, so that Thortus could watch from afar. When the fire finally reached a decent size, his opponent stood, looking defiant. The man had arrived only a day ago, from the distant flaming islands of Tloth, and immediately challenged Danath. Apparently he'd killed the man's friend in an earlier Stoneweaving duel. Not that he'd recognized the name, or even remembered it now. Come to think of it, he couldn't recall this one's name. Tezal? Terzar? He felt sure it had a 't' and a 'z' in there somewhere. Never mind. His interest lay in what the man would allegedly use. Not that he'd have turned down a duel, anyway. As champion he had to accept all challenges, and probably would have done regardless, simply for the thrill. But tradition meant that the loser would forfeit the stone used to the winner, and the base word if they didn't know it, so here he could actually gain something, other than just a valuable stone. The inhabitants of the Tloth region had supposedly learned which gemstone and word allowed them to control fire, though they remained understandably secretive with the knowledge. But now an opportunity to learn it had fallen into his lap, and he didn't intend to lose it. The man, Danath decided to think of him as Tezal, pulled a gemstone from inside his shirt. It shone a translucent reddish orange, and looked a bit like a tade, a gemstone he'd only seem pictures of. He couldn't quite recall its history, but suspected they'd now only be found in the Tloth region. Tossing the gemstone into the fire, Tezal said something Danath couldn't hear, and the fire shifted. Slowly at first, awkwardly, as though controlling it took effort, which he could understand. It appeared far more erratic than the stone and metal Danath usually used. It stood, coalescing into a vaguely human shape, flickering and flinching with disconcerting irregularity as it grew, rapidly consuming the fuel used to start it. Tezal stood up behind it, waiting with a glare. So he wouldn't be wearing it. Unsurprising, really, but Danath had held out hope it could be controlled enough to direct its heat away from the wielder. Turning away, he withdrew the dark red gemstone, a dett, and placed it on a nearby outcropping of stone. ""Luxthor"", he said, and felt an awareness of the stone flood his mind. It contained a few flecks of metal, but not enough to matter, and responded easily to his thoughts. Normally he used his favoured block of iron for duels, but against fire, stone seemed a wiser choice. Also, animating your weapon before a duel was considered poor manners, so he'd have had to lug it up here, which sounded too much like real work. The stone animated into a human shape, and he turned as it approached, stepping into the hollow area within, which sealed with a thought. Only a couple of slits remained open for him to see, and to let in air. He flexed, aligning the thoughts sent to his muscles with those going to his armour. Satisfied, he nodded to Tezal, whose fiery avatar advanced with erratic grace. Moving forwards, Danath remained uncertain how to deal with it. The gemstone powering it appeared to offer the only solid matter he could see within, so it apparently didn't need any other fuel. Did it still require air? Trying to smother it may be an option, probably his initial one. The tade seemed relatively unprotected within the flames, but he didn't want to risk destroying it if he could avoid doing so, and removing it, even if he knew the word and could touch it with his flesh, would be illegal in a duel. As they closed, the thing leapt forward, engulfing his armour in flames, and he barely closed the eyeholes in time, feeling a wave of heat crashing into his eyes. He felt the thing grappling his carapace with its gossamer grasp, holding on firmly. Its heat pulsed through his link to the stone, but distantly, more as a concept than a sensation, and he sensed slight cracks beginning to greet it along his shell. Not enough to cause a problem yet. Certainly not before the lack of air would be an issue. Grabbing the evasive form, he fell forward, unable to avoid a jolt from falling onto stone, no matter how well he controlled it. His opponent's avatar tried slipping out from under him, but he rolled around, fighting to keep it pinned, trying to grind it into the ground. It slipped free, though, shooting to his left. Rolling to the right, Danath scrambled to his feet, risking a quick opening of his eye slits, as much for air as to spot his enemy. It charged him again. Taking a deep breath, he sealed the slits before it hit, the force of the impact a strong gust of wind rather than a solid collision. Rolling with the blow, he dragged it to the ground again, but again it slipped through his grasp, clambering on top of him this time. He rolled over, but it always managed to stay on top, and he realized he didn't know how near the edge they'd gotten. They'd first clashed near the middle of the peak, and the last glimpse showed more than half its width in front of him, but they'd turned away from there. He'd better not risk moving much further until he got his bearings. The fall probably wouldn't kill him, but he couldn't know how far under water he'd have to go to extinguish the thing, and whether his air would last. Twisting to his feet, the stone shell matching his fluid grace, he flung the flaming avatar aside, expelling the surface layer of his stone avatar after it to push it away, and opening the slits as he did. The fiery creature stumbled around ten strides away, both of them around ten strides from the edge of the peak. A quick glance found Tezal over to the left, around twenty strides away. Charging his true opponent, Danath caught a moment of panic in Tezal's eyes before his concentration deepened, and knew the fiery avatar would be racing to intercept, as Tezal scrambled around to use it as cover. Glancing back at the avatar while maintaining his charge, Danath found it closing faster than he'd have liked. No matter how well he managed to merge with it, running in stone remained an exertion, both physical and mental, which had begun to take its toll. No doubt Elgren would put it down to too little practice. Nevertheless, the flaming avatar would catch him before he could reach Tezal. Time to see how well Tezal handled multiple fights, then. Opening the front of the avatar as he ran, Danath sprang from it as he directed it to change course directly at Tezal's avatar. He slowed to a walk as his mind adjusted to the two of them no longer moving in synch, and he had to keep the avatars in sight to direct the fight. Still backing away, Tezal looked flustered as he glanced between Danath and the clashing avatars. The flaming avatar tried slipping around, but found its path always blocked, its stony opponent flowing as it tried to grapple and smother the flames, no longer limited to a human shape. Danath charged Tezal, keeping the pressure on. Both had short blades drawn, Danath's iron, and Tezal's looking vaguely coppery. Tezal's attention focussed entirely on Danath's approach now, as he tensed to meet him. His eyes adopted a puzzled look as Danath slowed merely steps away, and he only just managed to dive away from the pair of avatars, as Danath's charged through where Tezal had been standing with the fiery one in its grasp, continuing over the edge. While he didn't like to risk losing the tade, Danath had no idea how skilled Tezal would be with a sword, so the distraction seemed the smartest way to end this. Spinning back to his feet, Tezal danced away from where his enemy had been, but not fast enough, as Danath caught his sword hand in a firm grip, holding it in place as his own blade found Tezal's throat. They remained poised as Danath's attention split back to their avatars. They'd reached the water by that point, and he could feel the faint pressure all around his stone surrogate, merging with flailing streams of heat from the other's dying struggles. He had his avatar stretch its arms into a scoop beneath the fading thing, and relief washed over him as something drifted onto it. The gemstone secured, he began the avatar's ascent from the water. Tezal's face showed his defeat, and he didn't struggle as Danath took his weapon, and directed him towards the edge of the plateau, from where he could see and direct the ascent of his avatar as it cleared the water. His attention split, Danath faced Tezal. ""What's the base word?"" With obvious reluctance, Tezal replied. ""Thir."" ""Thir,"" said Danath, as he held Tezal's eyes. He could see the certainty of a doomed man in them. Which changed to confusion as Danath slid his blade into its scabbard, turning from his defeated opponent, to meet his avatar as it returned. Obviously he hadn't expected to survive losing a fight. But Danath had no reason to kill him now. Why did people always expect that of him? He killed when paid to. Or when a duel went that far. But with his opponent's avatar beaten he'd won, so had no need to kill. If he went killing anyone at any time, people may get the idea they didn't have to bother paying him all that much, and then he may actually have to get a proper job. No way did he intend to let that happen. ",candidate00002
4,00001,candidate00003,"“What's so important that I have to miss my daily dose of Kiwi drama?!” came the voice as he strode into the underground bunker-like room. Weekdays at 7pm – straight after the news was time for Shortland Street, NZ's longest running TV 'soap'. John Key didn't actually watch it, but he thought it was a suitable joking jibe for these guys who were taking up his evening time. As Prime Minister of New Zealand, he didn't get much free time, so reminding people who called 'special' meetings at odd hours was fair game he thought. “Sorry Sir” answered the older of the two men waiting for him in the small room, “You'll soon see the circumstances warrant this degree of disruption and security.” Jerry Mateparae was a veteran of politics and a man at the top of his game. Prior to his very recent appointment as head of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), NZ's communications monitoring operation a few months ago, he had come through a long chain of ever increasingly senior and more 'political' appointments in the NZ Army. A long way from his roots as an enlisted private in the Army's Regular Forces, Jerry had subsequently passed through Officer training, and the elite Special Air Services, before climbing through the various 'chain of command' roles to become Chief of the Army, and then Chief of Defense Force. And then the Prime Minister had announced his appointment to the GCSB Director role, a post he had taken up at the start of February, only to have himself announced as the Governor General elect one month later! Jerry was a solder's soldier – and in the couple of month at GCSB he had had quite an effect on the way things were done. He also had an ingrained sense of duty and hierarchy, and as his current boss came fully into the room, he stood and indicated the chair in front of him, then motioned to the other occupant of the room to get the door. The younger man sealed the door and came back to the table, seating himself beside his boss and facing the PM. Apart from the three men, their chairs and the table, the room was empty, bar the slim red-jacketed manila folder on the table between them. John looked at the third man and Jerry made the introductions. “Sir, this is one of my Special Projects Managers. He reports directly to me. You can call him Fin. His surname is need to know.” “Even for me?!” the PM asked incredulously. “Yes Sir, even for you.” Jerry agreed quietly, trying to avoid any tone of defiance in his voice. It wasn't strictly necessary, but Jerry had learned a long time back in his Army life that loyalty will follow more easily when reflected by the boss. But also, he felt that in these more 'political' roles, he should have some 'rules of engagement' for when his Department was dealing externally, and this was one of his rules – more to prove a point than for any need for secrecy to keep his people safe. Although in the case of the Special Projects Operatives, the need was greater than for most people. Special Projects blurred the line between traditional GCSB roles and other departments' roles. Fin reached out his hand to shake with John Key and said “It's a pleasure to meet you Sir.” John returned the handshake and got straight down to business. “What have you got for me then?” he asked as he slid the folder towards himself but not yet opening it until the unwritten protocol of this type of briefing allowed. This type of briefing was very unusual. The underground SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) meeting room was only ever used for those meetings that never happened. The kind of meeting that doesn't show up on your meeting schedule program and that you only know is going to happen when you see that yellow chalk “X” on the right-side rear tyre of your car. The unnatural looking “X” that has crossbars on the ends of the cross members on only the 2 bars of the rearward facing chevron. In a car park that is secure-access only underneath the government buildings of New Zealand’s capital city. This was actually the first time Jerry had used this mechanism, and the PM himself had only had one previous occasion with the previous GCSB Director in his two and a half years in office, and they both knew that it was only resorted to for serious matters that were not for public consumption until some careful deliberation had taken place. John obviously respected the technical and political skills his GCSB boss demonstrated, and knew he would not have called the meeting lightly. Jerry drew a deep breath and started. “Well Sir, you will recall the intel our office has provided you in regards to the various 2012 Doomsday Cults? Despite the death of Osama the other day, we now have very solid leads on a number of these that confirm our earlier belief that several of the more serious cults are organising themselves together, and aligning themselves with certain terrorist organisations to deliver a global Doomsday campaign. And if that isn't enough, I have to report that now we are certain there is a NZ-based group of individuals who are also making a global extermination plot.” “What!” Mr Key exploded incredulously “New Zealand terrorists?!” “Well Sir,” Jerry responded carefully, “I wouldn't go so far as to label them 'terrorists', as their goal is not terror. Their goal is simply the extermination of everyone on the planet outside of New Zealand.” “And how is that not terrorism?” Key asked tapping the table with his thumb, an aggrieved look on his face. “Of course, technically it is terrorism, but these people are rank amateurs and they don't have the same kind of 'cause' that terrorists usually have.” “So if they're amateurs, we don't have to worry about them. Pick them up, lock them up quietly, problem solved?” John retorted. “Actually Sir,” Jerry almost squirmed in his seat, “We could do that, but we think that this could be our solution to the bigger problem of the real terrorists. Fin, why don't you tell the Prime Minister your plan.” Fin noticed the “your plan” emphasis momentarily analysing that this was both an out for his boss if it went wrong or wasn't liked, and praise if it was good. However, in their line of work, he was used to such double-edged swords of words almost as much as he was used to more substantive, sharp, shiny and less metaphysical swords and was happy to let it pass uncommented. “Sir, actually these un-terrorists are old school friends of mine. It seems they are putting in place a plan to develop stocks of a virulently lethal biological agent, and deploy this agent globally in a manner that is likely to kill all humans across the world, leaving only our country unaffected. They are doing this because they have come to believe the same information that we now know to be true – that there are cults and terrorists intent on destroying the world, and they plan on launching a pre-emptive strike to beat them at their own game and be the last ones standing.” The PM, for a complete change, was lost for words. It was a tall order to believe that some ordinary Kiwi citizens were planning such an audacious event. Finally, he got himself back under control. “How on earth do they expect to pull that off by themselves?” he demanded “Is that even possible?” “Unfortunately it is.” Fin confirmed. He reached over and opened the manila folder spreading out the papers inside for the PM's attention. On one was a fact sheet with a Bio-Haz warning logo on the top right hand corner. It was headed up “The Anthrola Virus” and featured an 'Executive Summary' style description of the lethal effects of the virus before going on to more detail describing the origins, the mechanism by which it worked, the symptoms and a list of the facilities that were known to have samples of the virus. A second sheet featured a report detailing what they knew about the plot – called Operation Scythe, and a third sheet with photo's and descriptions of the plotters – Josh, Tom, Liz and Linda. It was an extremely condensed version of the information they had back at GCSB HQ, but it contained all that the PM needed to know. John had already read the executive summary of the Anthrola virus and picked up and started to read the report on Scythe. Fin and Douglas let him read, waiting patiently in silence. The report was thorough and concise, carefully crafted to be the best way to deliver the news. It detailed how the group was sourcing funding, the activities of Josh in his Bio-Haz Services business, and the fact that Tom and Linda had recently made an order for two million air-freshener cans and spray units broken into smaller, staged, delivery lots. This last recent item cemented the belief that they were committing to taking the project off the drawing board and into reality and was the reason Fin had now stopped delaying in bringing their activities to his superiors attention. The PM put down the report, his mind reeling. He picked it up again, but he looked at it with eyes that weren't receiving. “Two million cans!!” he was thinking. “My god!” he finally breathed into the silence. “Yes Sir.” replied Fin quietly and tastefully. “Perhaps you can see why we think they might be able to succeed?” John quietly nodded. His mind still struggling with the enormity and sheer audaciousness of the plan. Fin continued, “and therefore, if they can succeed, then they neutralise the threat from the real terrorists for us.” John suddenly focused his eyes on Fin, slamming his palm down on the table to emphasise his point “By wiping out the entire world’s population!” he reminded them. “Yes Sir.” agreed Jerry taking over from Fin. “But Sir, consider this … ” he started ticking off the points with his fingers “One) the threat from the cults linking with the terrorists is very real. Two) stopping them any conventional way is beyond our capability. Three) enlisting other countries agencies is also not going to get them all without violating every law there ever was, and Four) if we go after one group, it is likely to cause the others to trigger their plans early with catastrophic results. As unpalatable a thought as it might be, the tactical solution that this Project Scythe provides is one of the best options.” “At the expense of billions of innocent lives.” Key repeated. “Yes Sir.” repeated Jerry. “However thousands of innocent lives are lost every day, and if you take a long hard look at the world at the moment, what have you got – you've got a mess really. You've got religious wars where brother is fighting brother, you've got turf wars where the people fighting now have really no idea of the original reason – it's just entrenched in their upbringing from thousands of years ago, and you've got global warming and one man-made disaster after another. Almost everywhere outside of New Zealand you have an unsustainable ecological pressure of a multitude of people on limited resources which are fast being ripped out of the ground and largely squandered. The world is currently fighting over land and oil. Pretty soon they will be fighting over fresh water, and soon after that they'll be fighting over clean air. We've always said how lucky we are to live here in our own little un-spoilt paradise – don't you think it's time we made the hard decision to secure paradise before we get dragged into the mire the rest of the world is getting itself into now?” John Key was a good honest Kiwi bloke at heart. But he was also a pragmatist and a good leader. He could make hard decisions, and he recognised the logic in what they were suggesting - but the humanist in him was not going to give up without a fight. And even if this was the most clear cut logic in the world, there was a whole lot more to consider than what had been spoken so far. “This needs more thought.” he finally pronounced. “I hear what you're saying Jerry, but I need a team set up to debate this. Naturally it needs to be a very tiny team of select individuals with security clearances that are off the chart. This stays with us until then. Clearance will be name only.” They nodded agreement. “In the meantime we let Scythe run free Sir?” Jerry asked for official confirmation. “Yes” answered Key. “But you better make sure you know exactly what they're doing at all times, without showing your hand.” “Of course Sir.” they both answered together. “My God!” he muttered again half to himself as picked up the folder and walked out of the SCIF room. Fin and Jerry sat for a few seconds and then Fin looked at his boss “Well,” he said “he bought it.” Jerry nodded “So far.” he said wryly “You'd better be damn sure about them though Fin. The words 'there's a lot riding on this one' do not even come close to describing this mess.” He stood up to leave. “I know my friends” Fin replied steadfast in his belief as he too rose from his chair. “They won't let us down. Especially if we give them a wee quiet nudge from the shadows along the way as and if required.” And with nothing more to say, they left the SCIF shutting the door behind them and sliding the plaque on the front from “Busy” to “Free”. Environs of Maiko National Park, DR Congo, 04 May 2011 (Wednesday) 1500 Zulu Deep in the heart of the African continent, above the steamy rainforest that swarmed in the vicinity of the waters that fed the second largest river on Earth, a green/grey gnat-machine batted through the turgid air as it headed towards home base. A solid, barrel-chested man sat clipped in to the canvas seat looking pensively out the pinned-back door of the Huey as it's twin blades smacked their endlessly rotating path through the heat of the African afternoon. He never tired of the view from the chopper and even though others would see a boring endless canopy of green, he read the lay of the land, the loops and rapids of the river systems, saw the interplay between land & water, tree and sky and constantly probed for and analysed the human presences and potential targets for human presence. He especially looked for signs of hidden humans and for potential places where he could have hiding places. LeBlanc was a man in need of plenty of hiding places. His business was not of the sort that endeared itself to law enforcement. He was, in fact, a terrorist. Or more correctly, he was “a fixer”, or an enabler of terrorists. He recruited where necessary, but usually it was a case of linking one group with another for a common purpose and finding them equipment, funding and training. Usually the cause showed itself to them, sometimes he would 'nudge' them in a direction that suited his purposes – mostly other customers purposes. A modern business person would probably describe him as a freelance consultant or business mentor while other, more simple persons might call him a gun-runner. Right at the moment he was coming back from a visit to Somalia where he had been assessing and assisting another batch of Somali pirates as potential 'grist for the mill' of one of his customers' cause. The pirates had recently completed a successful oil tanker hijack and had money to burn on new equipment. LeBlanc was quietly grooming them to step away from the pirate cause and up into the more elite circles of the militia and terrorism. There were several groups he worked with who would pay a worthwhile 'recruiting fee' for his trouble. It might seem odd for a terrorist enabler to have such a mighty machine as the indomitable Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter at his disposal, but this was a serious business, and he was well funded. He even had a Bell AH-1 Cobra attack gunship helicopter, but that was a bit more conspicuous! The Iroquois was also more useful for cargo carrying and troop deployment as well, hence it's more frequent use. The home base he was headed for was more of a training camp than a home. Hidden deep in the jungle that surrounded the headwater tributaries of the mighty Congo river, it was remote, and he hoped, impossible to find unassisted. From the town of Waine-Rukula, if you followed the twists and turns of the Maiko River deep into the Parc National de la Maiko closer to the Uganda and Rwanda borders, and then if you picked the correct un-named side river that fed into the Maiko and followed that upstream, you might find a place where for a section of about 100 metres, the tree canopies reached together from either bank hiding the river from any aerial observation, but leaving enough room for a carefully controlled helicopter to fly underneath and hover at the edge of a short jetty that sprouted suddenly, as if from nowhere, out of the left-hand bank. The jetty came out just far enough to keep the Huey rotor blades safely clear of the tree branches, but it took an accomplished pilot to perform the feat. If you did find this spot however, and you were an unscheduled visitor, you would not live to tell anyone of the jetty in the middle of nowhere, for the trees on the bank featured several carefully concealed observation hides that were always manned with tough individuals who were competent with the long barreled rifles they carried. When it came to weaponry in Africa, most people used the ubiquitous AK-47. Its simple design and ruggedness, coupled with its commonness, made it the perfect weapon for the large continent. However, the AK-47 was limited in longer range accurate shooting stakes so these guards had the equally rugged L1A1 SLR with its longer barrel and 11mm longer cartridge than the AK's, contributing to a superior range and stopping power. With their wooden 'furniture', and solid metal construction, they were big, heavy and ugly in a functional way that only a soldier could love. These men had depended on them for their lives. As LeBlanc's chopper approached the spot, the guards heard it before they could see it. There was no need for the radio identification that was available since the chopper was distinctive and expected. They tried to limit radio use just in case there were any eavesdroppers out there trying to find them – LeBlanc hadn't survived as long as he had in this business without being careful, and radio silence was a standard, common-sense precaution. It didn't mean they couldn't use the much shorter range personal communication radios that the guards used to ensure the security of the camp. They had a common frequency radio network which all the guards were plugged into at all times via earplug and voice activated throat mike. However any 'RF snooper' would have to be right in the immediate vicinity of the camp to detect the signal. Careful choice of frequency and power, and achieving the required coverage by a network of carefully sited repeaters, meant they broadcast all they liked and the foliage would block the signals from being intercepted above, while still keeping them all in touch within the different parts of the camp. As the chopper carefully beat its way up the side river, low over the water, the designated 'downstream' guard radioed in its arrival. It hardly hovered for more than a couple of seconds over the jetty edge before LeBlanc had hopped down onto its decking. He strode away without looking back as it ponderously continued its course upstream, around the bend and continued for a few more bends before breaking out of the river bed and making a beeline for its home. The helicopters 'lived' in a different place to the rest of the camp. A small natural clearing about two kilometres away featured a carefully camouflaged hangar for the two birds well back under the trees. When the choppers were coming and going, a movable screen of artificial shrubs was used to shield the under-tree entrance from any prying eyes as the choppers were pushed, on their clip-on wheel units, into concealment as soon as they had landed. The hangar was connected to the base by a path that wound under the densest parts of the jungle cover, wide enough for a small truck, but seldom used by any vehicle to further minimise the chances of detection. The comm-link network extended out here too, with directional repeaters (rather than omni-directional repeaters) spaced strategically along the path. LeBlanc did not consider himself paranoid about security - just highly conscious and not given to taking unnecessary risks. While he had worked very hard to remain anonymous and on the sidelines of the terrorist world stage, he knew his little enterprise would be high on the 'wanted' list for any law enforcement or military operations, for without their sponsor or source of military supplies, the terror elements would not exist for long. Also, he knew it was just as likely that he might be found 'accidentally' while such an organisation was searching for some other party. As LeBlanc strode along the jetty he glanced up into the trees to check the guards were doing their jobs. Despite the fact that he was a distinctive man and their boss, he was satisfied to see that the designated 'jetty' guard had his rifle trained on him all the way from when he was in the chopper, and that the 'downstream' and 'upstream' guards paid him only scant attention at the edge of their interlocking visual sweeps through their patrol areas. It had only been necessary to make an example of one guard soon after they had set up here, to teach them all how seriously he took security. Ever since that careless, lax, man had been steadily skinned alive over the span of several days, the other guards had learnt the lesson very well. His marked, but un-named grave was the first thing you saw when you exited the compound main gate as a constant reminder of the unflagging rules. At the edge of the jetty he approached the camouflaged 'bank' guard post and gave the codeword. The guard nodded and handed him one of the comm-link units. Only when LeBlanc started putting on the comm-link did the 'jetty' guard relax his cover and return to his scan of the jetty and far river bank. LeBlanc strode purposely along the path to the main compound. He was pleased with the set-up and the discipline the men were showing. It had only been possible for him to see them because he knew where to look, otherwise, the river bank had seemed deserted and the jetty totally out of place. As he completed his short walk towards the compound, he radioed in as he reached the checkpoint that faced the gate “Alpha One at Skin Point”. Again, he was satisfied to see the inner perimeter guards had their rifles on him up until he made the call. Making the grave marker the checkpoint was he thought a decidedly constant reminder! He waited a few seconds until he heard “Doormat clear” in his earpiece, and then he strode forward the last 5 metres to the door in the compound wall, stepping through as it opened for him. He watched the process as one of the inner guards was covering him with his SLR while the door opener secured the door, reactivated the mines outside and made the call over his radio “Doormat live”. Once the door was shut and the mines reactivated, the inner guard relaxed his weapon and gave a nod of recognition to LeBlanc. Continuous repetition of the security process had been drummed into them all. Trust no-one until you know for sure who they are and that the area is secure. The marked grave regularly taunted them to this need. Once inside, LeBlanc could see more easily the nature of the compound he had designed and built himself. As he always did when returning from anything more than a same-day trip, he scrutenised and surveyed it as if for the first time, probing the features and looking for weaknesses that he might have missed. Starting at the perimeter, the outer fence was a circle, unbroken except at the three entrance/exits which were positioned in the nature of a “Y” so that there two other exits if one was targetted, and there wasn't a straight line of sight from either of the entrances to any of the others. He'd chosen the circle shape rather than a square, rectangle or other shape since it offered no edges or side-by-side bulges by which someone could gain leverage against to climb up the wall. To further prevent climbing, the perimeter fence itself was made from vertical strips of stainless steel mounted with their thin edges facing in/out to maximise the visibility through the structure so they could see and fire through it much more readily. The upright strips were set at their base into concrete that was buried under half a metre of earth, and held together near the top by welding to another strip of steel. There were no bolts or rough surfaces to gain a climbing purchase on. To prevent anyone trying to grapple hook this horizontal joiner, the uprights continued for about another foot above this, and then featured a 'crown' of sturdy but thin and razor sharp metal that would cut through any rope passed over it, plus the electrical signal passing through it, would be distorted signaling a disturbance to the control room. Outside the fence for a distance of 5 metres, a densely populated mine field of “Bouncing Betty” S-mines ran all around the fence. At the 3 entrances, the S-mines were replaced with Claymores angled on each side of the clear path. The Claymores were triggered by an infrared virtual tripwire which was armed and disarmed from the controls at each gate. 5 metres inside the fence, a replica steel upright fence was positioned, and again, the space in between was filled with mines. At the gates, the guard post was an air-lock style box which extended 4 metres each side of the path and was delineated by thick bullet-proof Lexan panels – including the roof to shield from rain and grenades or other projectiles alike. The side panels featured thin horizontal slots for the rifle barrels but otherwise provided a safe, dry haven for the guards with unlimited visibility. The outer door was a replica of the vertical bars fence, while the inner door was bullet-proof Lexan in a solid metal frame. Inside the inner fence, the jungle was totally cleared out except for some of the larger trees that towered up high above the compound. These trees provided a natural, spreading canopy to hide the base from the air. By careful selection using the helicopter as a spotter, LeBlanc had achieved almost a complete canopy cover up top, while having an almost totally clear circular space below. There were a couple of small natural openings in the foliage but the spots were known and nothing incriminating took place in those spots other than the occasional person walking through it. Closer in towards the centre of the circle were the bases buildings. The majority of them were underground with the entranceway built up against the tree that provided its camouflage. There were a handful of small buildings however, built around a tree with the roof of each carefully constructed to present an irregular shape from above and careful tree-like camouflage was employed as well to hide each structure. The insides of the walls and roof were also well insulated to minimise the chances of heat signatures being detected. The underground entranceways were like concrete outhouses, festooned with shrub-like appendages to make them blend in with the tree's surrounds. They were open-fronted since they led steeply down-stairs immediately, and dealing with a door from the downstairs side was too difficult. Instead, as the steps reached the bottom, a pair of airlock style doors were encountered, before opening into the underground chamber. The underground chambers were down quite deep – so as not to disturb unduly the roots of the trees, and also to provide a shield for bunker-style safety. The underground building had been dug as one huge area but had been finished as three separated spaces over two levels. One space was the Base HQ and staff quarters, the second was the mess hall, recreational area and guest quarters, and the third area one level down featured the training rooms, over-flow accommodation, and a 25 yard rifle & handgun range. The three sections were sealed off completely from each other with thick reinforced concrete walls. There were separate entrances to each area, and the only interconnect between them was one case where the overflow accommodation near the training rooms could be accessed from the guest quarters, however each entranceway featured a heavy security door that was opened via a programmable electronic prox (proximity) device and LeBlanc could control who had access and who didn't. The electronic locks were linked to the Control Room computers and each activation was logged with the user code recorded. Each permanent staff member had a small personal issue prox device (usually on a strap around their neck), while guests would be issued a larger, more fragile, card style device – either personally or via the squad or troop leader depending on status and trustworthiness. Each underground area featured one main entranceway with the electronic air-lock doors, and two emergency egress points. The latter consisted of a solid concrete tube with a vertical ladder bolted to the inside with a hatch at the bottom and another at the top that opened only from within – again the electronic swipe card would unlock the hatch. These hatches were disguised from above as large shrubs or tree stumps. Clustered around the perimeter not too far away from the entranceway to the underground rifle range, were the few above-ground buildings. While in reasonable proximity to each other, they were all separated by a distance of at least ten metres, and in addition to the camouflage elements, they featured thick blast-proof Lexan wall paneling’s. These were storage rooms for the explosives and ammunition. Predominantly on the opposite side of the compound from the collection of ammo huts, but scattered around the compound in aerially concealed locations, an obstacle course could be seen, featuring a climbing platform with a skinny wall up the side of one of the trees, a scramble net, a barbwire covered mud crawl, a low obstacle wall (solid), a high obstacle wall with spaced slats, and a section of tire-run leading to a choice of rope or tree climb and high rope. The various training elements could be incorporated into the morning or afternoon PT runs with or without kit in endless combinations. After a few days of in-compound training of this sort, they would normally head them outside the compound and tackle the natural jungle environment on extended forced marches or jungle runs. LeBlanc's practiced eye swept the area mentally checking off each item correctly in its place with no change to the tree canopy cover. Satisfied, he headed to the main HQ entranceway. Just before he ducked in and down the stairs, he checked in on his comm-link. “Alpha One at HQ” he said, then flicked the switch that deactivated the throat mic, pulled out his prox pendant from under his shirt, swiped and opened the first door. As he made his way through the empty 'air-lock' to the second door, he noticed that one of the control room staff was watching him through the Lexan panels, with one hand on a pistol on the desktop beside him. LeBlanc nodded to him as he proxed the door open and stepped inside the building proper. As the guard verified his identity matched the prox card details and photo that came up on his screen, he took his hand off the pistol and returned to scanning his instruments. The control room did not open directly to the interior space accessed through the 'airlock' entrance, however the side wall observed this area through several layers of the clear blast-proof Lexan The compound had not been cheap to build, but the security it offered him was second to none and the cost had already been repaid from the training business he brought into it. When they brought trainees in, they were more often than not brought a long way up the river well past the side stream. The boat would then ground on one end of a random 'island' and transfer them to the chopper which would land on the other end. Once in the chopper they would be blindfolded before taking off in an unrelated direction, then going through a series of random and bewildering turns and motions to confuse their sense of direction, before carrying on in the proper direction to intercept the side stream and the jetty. Once hovering over the jetty, their blindfolds would be removed and they would be escorted through the guards (who made themselves very visible on these occasions), to the guest quarters mess hall where they would be processed for identification and advised in no uncertain terms of the rules. Unless they were favoured guests (which they almost never were), their weapons would be taken from them before getting on the chopper and stored in the out-buildings until needed for training. The guests were very conscious that they had no weapons while the compound staff had plenty. Each staff member usually wore at least one knife and a pistol strapped to their waist or body webbing. Additionally when they exited the underground buildings, they would usually also collect either an AK-47 or an SLR depending on their task. LeBlanc went past the control room and briefly ducked into the kitchenette to grab a beer from the fridge. While the main mess hall was in the next-door guest quarters section, they had a separate means of having drinks and snacks in this area so they could be self sufficient if necessary and not have to go the long way round to grab a coffee. They were just coming out of the dry season and the heat was oppressively muggy. He pressed the cold bottle against his forehead and rolled it all over as he headed further along the corridor to his private office adjacent to the map room. Proxing the lock, he opened the door, stepped in and settled in to his chair, then he took a refreshing swig of the cool liquid, savouring it in his mouth for a few seconds before swallowing and poking his computer into life. He was expecting an e-mail. Berbera, Somalia, 21 June 2011 (Tuesday) 1500 Zulu Hunkered down on the flat roof, Fin was feeling the heat. Even though he was both hiding from his quarry and sheltering from the sun, he was exposed to the reflections off the roof of the afternoon sun. He slowly and carefully lifted the floppy-brimmed hat and wiped the sweat from his brow while still keeping his eyes on the building across the road and the approach to it. Placing his eye back to the high power, stubby, telescope on its tripod, he again scanned the buildings inner courtyard, focusing once more on the group lounging around inside in the shade of a patched and faded, stripy awning. Fin was pirate watching. Not, the 'shivver-me-timbers-parrot-on-the-shoulder' type of pirate, but perhaps an even deadlier type – the modern Somali oil tanker hi-jacking type. Armed with AK-47's, RPG's, sat-phones and jet-ski's, these guys had no compunction in killing and blowing up an oil tanker causing a massive ecological disaster if they didn't get their way – which was to receive large sums of millions of dollars. While these guys were a security concern in their own right, from Fin's intelligence intercepts, they had reason to believe this particular batch of pirates was trying to step up into the big league and work with some of the really nasty players – even the AQIM if they could build up the “cred” to be worthy. They had not been able to pinpoint the real big 'bad-boys' so far and were hoping to access them through these 'little fish'. AQIM (al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) is a North Africa region-wide jihadist alliance. It is primarily made up of Algeria's jihadist groups but the intelligence Fin's team had been gathering over the last year, and which had been accelerating over the last few months, indicated that AQIM was extending their co-ordination further afield and linking up with other Al-Qaeda-linked terrorist cells elsewhere in the region - including many Somali groups. Some of these groups had received training in terrorist hideouts in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Somalia was a perfect spot for this, as it was strategically located along one side and at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden through which a lot of the worlds key cargo ships flowed. Directly across the Gulf, was Yemen at the bottom of the Middle East, and specifically across from Berbera, where Fin was today, was the port of Aden, where a terrorist bomb killed 17 aboard the USS Cole a decade earlier. From their base across the road, the pirates could zoom out in their jet-ski's right into the busy sea-lanes for their pick of the ships, or sneak across into Yemen, (itself a hot-bed of unrest), then either over-land through Saudi Arabia to Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan & Pakistan, or along the coast to access these Al-Qaeda “home bases”. Fin's current role in Special Projects for the GCSB didn't normally involve field work of this sort, but due to the extreme sensitivity of this project, they couldn't use a lot of their normal resources and had to do a lot of it themselves. On this mission, even though they had intercepted reasonably specific intel about the group being about to receive Al-Qaeda sponsored training, it was still only a slim lead among many options, and so Fin had only himself, and one local 'affiliated agent' to call on for assistance. The French DGSE trained local was acting the part of a fisherman working on the hull of his friends upturned boat in the place next to the pirates'. Ade (pronounced Ah-deh), was a deep cover local and lived in the parts so he was able to be so open and close without raising any suspicion, however Fin had to be much more circumspect and had to avoid any overt contact with him lest he blow his cover. Fin was able to relay progress reports and meeting details via text messages to his cell phone which would vibrate rather than ring at his call. Thus at a little after 3 o'clock, when Fin saw a battered land rover approaching, he was pre-warned and hard at work with his sander – but ready with the magnetic tracker button for any opportunity to slip it in or onto the vehicle should it prove to be the awaited contact. As the land rover approached down the street, it started slowing as if the driver was searching for something, and then stopped outside the building. A young African man in his mid to late 20's got out from the driver’s seat and knocked on the door to the courtyard gate of the pirates building. As he did so, Ade hoisted a crate of nets up on his shoulder, and started walking down the road on a course that would take him alongside the land rover. As the driver was ushered in through the door of the pirate compound, Ade seemed to accidentally drop a float out of the crate beside the outside rear wheel of the jeep, and as he bent and put down his crate to pick it up, he deftly attached the magnetic tracker up underneath the side of the land rover before scooping up the float, and continuing on his way. Meanwhile up on the roof, Fin was busy with the long lens digital SLR camera. He'd already taken some shots of the land rover as it parked outside the pirate lair, and of the young man getting out and meeting the pirates who'd opened the door and led him inside. He'd made sure to zoom in close on the number plate, and for chain-of-evidence reasons, had also several shots of Ade placing the GPS tracking device. Now he waited for the young man to come back out to get some front-on shots while watching, and photographing, the activity in the compound. Ade meanwhile had gone on and disappeared – back to pick up his own 4WD and drive it around to the back of the building to pick up Fin if needed. In the “olden days”, with only the two of them, he would have had to hang around to try and follow the land rover which would have an increased risk of being spotted. Even the older tracking devices had an element of risk as they relied on sending a radio signal which meant you still had to follow with a radio receiver to track where they went. The new tracker technology, however, made things a lot easier and safer, by recording the precise GPS co-ordinates at time-stamped intervals and squirted the info up to a satellite network for downloading anywhere in the world. The device was 'smart' though and adjusted the frequency of the updates depending on the rate of motion – if it detected rapid motion it would update more frequently, if stationary, less frequently. Fin's team back in NZ would be accessing the info at the same time as Fin himself in Somalia. By overlaying the tracker positions on an accurate map, they could follow the vehicle and see where it stopped and check them out later without appearing to be connected to following the vehicle. It seemed as if this was indeed the contact they'd been expecting. The young man had been ushered over to the group of pirates under the awning. He'd handed over a slightly grubby A4-sized envelope and then had been led back to the door. As he and the land rover was leaving, the pirates started breaking up into ones and twos, heading off to different parts of the building and courtyard. The ones around the courtyard started getting boxes of gear out of storage sheds and loading them on the tray of a beat-up looking utility vehicle. They were obviously preparing to go somewhere. Fin briefly considered his options. He needed to know where they were going that was for sure. If it was to the training camp, it would no doubt lead to being able to track other groups that also came through the camp in the future, and with a lot of luck they could lead directly to the Al Qaeda network. Tracking the messenger might not lead anywhere, especially if he was just a simple messenger. He couldn't risk trailing them when they were either collected or went to their meet point, as the chance of being spotted and blowing their cover was too high. He sent a text to Ade “Not moving. Need tracker on cargo - wood crate - green rpg.” Ade knew it would be difficult. He would need to prepare the device and then wait for an opportunity to place it without arousing suspicions. This would be next to impossible inside the compound so they'd have to wait until they came out. He returned to his boat repairs and in between his various comings and goings between boat and house, prepped his bug. The particular bug had the same functionality as the magnetic one he'd popped on the land rover, but was in the form of something between a nail and a drawing pin. The sharpened shaft was both housing for the electronics, antenna, and secure mounting aid. He had fitted it into a pen-sized pneumatic nail-gun-like launching device that would mean he could drive it into the wooden box by simply touching it to the side and clicking the button. The compressed air would be released propelling the 'nail' biting into the wood. In this manner it was similar to a nail-gun but a lot quieter than those cartridge powered construction tools. Now, with the loaded launcher in his pocket, he just had to wait for his opportunity to access the cargo. Meanwhile, Fin was alternating his watch between the compound, the road, and the laptop with the tracker overlaid on the grid-map of the area he had loaded up. Everything looked normal and the land rover appeared to be heading out the other side of town without making any other stops. In the pirates compound, they appeared to be finished with their preparations. There was a small stack of wooden crates on the Ute as well as a collection of kitbags and backpacks. Fin thought that the crates looked like they could hold weapons – two of them were the RPG crates he'd advised Ade about, three seemed to be holding long rifles and assault rifles, and he'd seen the larger box filled as a catch-all container with a selection of military paraphernalia such as radios, maps, compass', GPS devices and the like. One of the crates would be a good location for the bug, and Fin had already indicated to Ade that the RPG box might be the best. He knew that Ade, with plenty of warning, could paint the tracker heads green as camouflage to hide it from view on the chosen crate, all he needed was a couple of seconds of access to the back of the Ute they were loaded in. Checking the laptop again, he noticed the land rover had finally come to a stop. It was out at the airport but parked away from the main terminal area in an area of no obvious function. Curious, Fin flicked up a file, entering his password to de-crypt it as he did so, and checked the satellite staging times listed inside. It would be another three quarters of an hour before the nearest satellite would swing past in it's never-ending arc. He checked the compound again - the pirates seemed to have finished their burst of activity and were back to the waiting game that all military men get so well used to. The Ute was loaded and abandoned, and the men were starting to bring out the makings of a meal. It looked like he had time. Securing the file and closing the laptop, he sent another text to Ade - “meet FOX in 5”, then he carefully reversed himself back from the edge of the roof and packed up his laptop, camera, tripod and scope into his back-pack, before checking and erasing any signs of his presence on the roof. He then moved towards the back of the building and down into the street on the far side. The back of the OP (Observation Post) was their designated point “Foxtrot” and only a minute after he was down, Ade came around the corner, carrying a small stack of planks on his shoulder – still continuing the boat fixing pretense. Quickly Fin brought him up to speed with what he had seen, the position of the messenger at the airport, and then handed him the camera to page through the shots he'd taken. Ade nodded and grunted as he saw the photos of the crates on the open decked Ute, satisfied that the tracker he'd selected would be suitable for the boxes. After studying the photo's carefully he agreed with Fin's assessment that bugging the vehicle would not be as effective as bugging the people or their cargo, as they would be likely to switch vehicles at some point, but their gear they would need to take with them. Bugging the pirates themselves was too risky and the crates offered the best opportunity. They decided the device would best be placed into the edge of the lid of one of the crates near one of the hinges as the least likely place to be spotted. They sketched out a plan whereby Fin, driving the land rover, would momentarily block the path of the pirates giving Ade the couple of seconds he needed to plant the tracker. It was a simple plan, but in their world, the simpler the plan, the more likely it was to work – complex plans had too many opportunities for things to go wrong. With the plan decided, Ade went back to his boat repairs and Fin went back up to the roof of their OP. Taking a small tube out of a pocket of the backpack, he carefully edged forward and secured the device into the structure of the air-conditioning unit such that it pointed down towards the pirate courtyard but was hidden from anything other than a serious search. Scooting back to his bag, he pulled out the laptop and plugged in a USB stick device which connected him to the camera he'd just placed checking the camera was sending, and the field of view was workable. He took another few minutes to edge forward again to make a small adjustment, then satisfied, returned the laptop to his bag and descended to the ground again. Time to prepare for his first direct contact with the enemy. ",candidate00003
5,00002,candidate00003,"The empty void of space … Majestic swirl of a spiral arm galaxy … [Zoom in… and in … and in … ] Near the outer arm the object moves. It's rate seems languid against the backdrop of stellar vastness, but it's long, kazoo-like shape, gobbled up the parsecs at an astronomical rate. [Zoom] The object was clearly artificial, however its surface, which resembled liquid mercury, showed no external protrusions of any kind including engine exhausts, panels, fasteners or openings. [Zoom] Slowly, with the speed of molasses dripping off a spoon, a section of the wall disolved into it's translucent state. She gazed out, seeing with her own eyes, that which her instruments had already shown her. Her ship had probed the spectrum, analysing the visual, phonics, sonic, sub-sonic, ELF, RF, SHF, and way past even the microwave range. It had “sniffed” for gasses, charted, probed and measured each bit of matter encountered as it thundered silently through space, gobbling up the parsecs on it's tireless journey, and now, still far ahead, it showed with the laser highlighted symbology of the viewing port heads-up display (HUD) the spot of light that piqued it's artificial curiosity. It had woken her towards the end of her normal sleep period with a report on an item that fitted the progammed parameters for special attention. Before it interrupted her peaceful slumber, the ship had run a battery of specific sensor sweeps and collected several Exabytes worth of data which it consolodated into the report. It was still just the beginning, but already the report exceeded several encyclopedia's worth of data covering geology, geography, biology, entmology, and sociology, on the target that had set off the alarm. She had woken to the muted alarm and knew instantly that they had discovered that which they searched for. With growing excitement therefore, she reached for the crystal-like object that materialised beside her sleep platform and thumbed the projection node. Instantly a holographic-like projection of a blue-white ball appeared above the crystal-like reader. As the sphere rotated, the data of the report began reciting directly into her brain. Simultaneously, the white disappeared revealing the geography of the planet hiding beneath the clouds. The atmospheric and planetary makeup played through her mind as she saw the land masses with their plains, mountains, rivers and lakes exposed to her view. It was not unfamiliar to her as she had seen many worlds in her journey, but this one she knew already due to the alarm, was different, and now as the initial basic planetary brief wound up she was going to see what the alarm meant. The briefing moved on from the planetary geology into the biological/entmological phase of the report and she leaned forward as if this would bring her closer to see all the better. The planet teemed with life. Large, small, winged, bipedal, quadrapedal, finned, and tailed. On the land, in the air and in the shallows and depths of the oceans, lifeforms of all stages of evolution crept, crawled and glided. And there, predominant over all, was the bidepal form of intelligent life that had set off the alarm and initiated the barrage of tests, for before the ship had even gotten close enough to see the tiny globe, it had felt it's far reaching presence. RF communications to and from a small object listlissly tracing it's arcing path outwards on it's own voyage of discovery. The signals had triggered the ships automated sensors, setting in motion the pre-programmed sequence. It had triangulated the signal, identified the craft, swept it with an array of sensors and rapidly determined it's nature. This discovery then triggered a second tier of tests – the ship computed the object's trajectory, and searched backwards along it's path to see what it could find. The unrelenting physics of the universe rapidly pinpointed the most likely stellar system and zoomed in to find the planetary origin. While still more than a full lightyear away, the ship identified the tiny jewel it sought. Changing course slightly, the ship had sped towards the star system while probing the depths ahead for every possible clue. Thus, while she slept on, the ship closed inexorably on it's target while sifting the data to prepare the report for her. Recorders locked in on the plethora of faint RF spectrum signals emanating from the distant dot, while the computer dissected the signals for the intelligence that was obviously contained inside. Measuring, interpreting, the ship was building up knowledge – painting a picture of the world ahead and the nature of the intelligence it was built to seek out. As the ship had closed on the star system it's powerful sensors probed and prodded far, far ahead of it, sifting and weighing. While still well outside the orbit of the farthest object of the star's planetary system, it determined it had enough data for the preliminary report. It further decided she had slept a suitable period and set about lighting and warming the ship for her awakening and then sounded the gentle alarm to raise her from her slumbers and alert her to the find. Now she gazed from the holo-globe spinning in front of her, out the viewport to the HUD-defined dot, noting the other HUD-annotated pinpoints of light which were this planet's sisters, and the rapidly largening yellow main sequence star / sun which they all orbited. Looking back to the report projector, she again flicked her long digit over the control node, triggering the report to move onto the data it had accumulated thus far on the intelligent life-form. As the data played through her head she grew increasingly excited as the data showed the technological achievements the species had attained. Obviously they had space flight – the object initially discovered so far away from the planets origin was evidence of that, but the ships analysis of the communication signals intercepted showed much more than that. As the analysis played on her excitement, slowly gave way to alarm and worry … “Mok-saaaannnnngggggggggggggg … “ As the last notes of the call echoed around the rafters of the dojo, he breathed in – slowly, through his nose, pushing the air up to the top and back of his head, then smoothly exhaling out through his mouth as he pushed the air down his spine to his toes and then all the way back up to the top of his head as he inhaled again. Jim had been training Kendo now for about 4 years, and he always looked forward to the circular breathing session at the close of training. After a fast and furious hour and a bit of smacking the living shit out of everyone else, that first deep breath in & out was kind of delicious! He'd taken a wee while and a bit of research to cotton on to the idea of circular breathing – how could any sensible person think that you pushed air up into your skull etc?, but once he twigged, the practice really did become very peaceful & soothing, and he could see how with a bit more application, there was the possibility of achieving that “no-mind” state where the next level of learning might be achieved. “Good training” he said, bowing to the others in the dojo. And then, he tapped one of the mid-level members on the shoulder and said “I was watching your attacks tonight – I think you are holding back too much. You can do it, I know you can, I've seen you do it, - you just need to be confident in yourself and always attack, attack, attack.” Jim always tried to offer constructive advice to the members that were obviously trying hard. As one of the club seniors it was expected of him, and he knew that not only did it help the learners, but it helped push him too, as he had to observe the others and analyse their stengths and weaknesses while working on his own weaknesses – and all in the heat of “battle”. As he wiped and stowed his armour in his bogu bag, Jim's mind started returning to “the real world”. He checked his cellphone for any missed calls or messages and saw one text message had arrived - unheard during the confusion of loud kiai's and the stamps and thwacks of bamboo sword on battle armour. It was from Tim. “Mail frm Chris. U r on for jpn & me 2 mmbai. C u 2moro, fly on w/e.” “Great”, he half groaned to himself. Approaching his teacher, Jim bowed and said “Sabumnim, I won't be at Kendo next week – I have to go to Japan.” “No problem James, maybe you can train Kendo while you're there?” his teacher replied. “Hmmm, I'm not sure, but I'll try!” Only his Kendo teacher called him by his real name, everyone else called him “Jim”. At 44, Jim was starting to suffer the effects of age. He supposed he wasn't doing too badly compared to others his age, but part from the Kendo, the only other exercise he did was biking to and from work, and so the morning tea hot chocolates and other sweet things he craved from time to time were starting to be noticeable in the tummy area. He had always been pretty active but recently the demands of his higher position at work meant there weren't enough hours left in the day for the long distance running he quite enjoyed. Well, that's what he always said – truth be known, it was much easier to give in to the laziness! Of course he knew there was only one person he was fooling, but he figured he'd worked hard to get where he was and had earned a bit of laziness here and there. Jim was Programme Manager for a family of airport flight information products. The 'boards' that show you if the flight is on time and what gate it's arriving at were just a small part of what they did. What was really needed was a complete integrated information system that connected the arrivals & departure times, passenger check-in details, baggage handling and full airport information. The beauty of what they did was the integration of otherwise seperate systems that gave the airport management much more control and analysis and increased efficiency and therefore profits. Tim was Product & Marketing Manager for their suite of systems. Together they decided and delivered the companys product line and roadmap. Tim steered the direction and Jim made sure it happened. They had been working together in the role for the last 2 years and they were a good combination. They were both “can do” kind of people, and when the other managers and senior engineers told them they were dreaming, they just knuckled in, solved the problem, and did it. Of course, it wasn't the easy way, but Jim in particular had built up a good team around them. They had spent a lot of effort engendering a team spirit that fostered individual empowerment and a real sense of family. They were proud that after inheriting the team with the lowest morale in the company, they had rapidly turned it around to become the “star” division that everyone wanted to be a part of. But more importantly, they were proud that not only was it a team in good spirits, it was a team at peak performance, and they knew that they could face the customers and make promises that would be delivered on where others couldn't. It was a good feeling! But it took effort. Most managers couldn't be bothered, but to Jim it was worth it. He hardly did anything except talk to customers, suppliers and to his team. Actually, it was his best place to be – he had no real talent for the engineering or product strategy, but he knew how to get the best of the people who did. “Wind them up and set them loose” was one of his mantra's. Right at the moment they were working on the next new development. The world wanted smaller, faster, cheaper, more powerful & more integrated. Always. The pace of development never slowed, and Jim's team was pounding the R&D treadmill driven by smaller, faster, more capable micro-processors and other associated integrated circuits or “chips” as they called them. Tim's message confirmed to Jim that they had received approval from their boss to take their next proposed product off the drawing board and into the real world. An important new customer in India had a need for a unique version of their regular product line that combined some features not normally mixed together in the same system. Normally they knew it would not be economically viable to develop such a product for one market specifically, but Tim figured that this one was what they called a “trend breaker”, and once the rest of the market cottoned on to the idea, that it would sell like hot cakes. Plus, India was a big enough market on it's own that they would get the return on investment from this one project – just. They had planned for Tim to visit the customer to make sure they understood exactly all their application issues and requirements, while Jim would “sell” the idea to their counterparts in the Japan head office. While Tim had already discussed the concepts with his Tokyo based Product Manager counterparts, they had learned that in order to make sure the product was correctly delivered into the lucrative and techno-hungry Japanese market in parallel with the new market in India, it required a physical visit to talk through all the co-ordination issues, plan the work schedule and market release. Through lots of hard work, Jim & Tim had built up the relationships and reputation of success in Japan that meant they could now rely on parallel introduction of prototypes to their colleagues in Japan and their early adopter partners in the market. If the product survived the quality focussed testing that they insisted on, they knew it would be a success everywhere. Without the parallel support, the new product would take longer to test on their own and the decreased market base meant the product would probably not be viable. Therefore as good an idea as it was, it would languish on the drawing board. No presure, Jim thought! But it was what they did every day – the kind of challenge that got them out of bed in the mornings. “Good news hon,” Jim said as he stowed his bogu bag in the cupboard when he got home, “you get the bed to yourself next week! Tim just told me we've got the go ahead for the new product so he's off to Mumbai and me to Japan. We'll finalise the details tomorrow but probably be just the week for me.” Jim's wife Jane, had gotten used to the short notice calls away. Luckily she was practical about such departures and, favouring the bright side, looked forward to having the bed to stretch out in all by herself. Throwing his towel over his shoulder, Jim picked up his bag and exited the shower. It was good they had the shower at work – it made biking in not so much of an issue, as he just had his morning shower after he arrived. Walking through his teams area to his desk in the corner, Jim chatted to the few people who were either already there or just arriving. Since he always liked to lead by example he was usualy one of the first there. Today there was only Luke there checking the report generated from the overnight test suite that was running on one of their current prototypes. Luke was one of Jim's “lieutenants”, a young and up-coming Software Engineer until Jim had recognised some organisational qualities in him and promoted him into a Team Leader role. “Morning tosser! How's it going this morning? Is that overflow bug fixed now?” “Seems to be, boss. No sign of that particular error code this morning, and what's more I think I've got an angle on that intermittant glitch we've been having. It looks like the watchdog goes off only sometimes, but only ever when one of the power feeds is switched on or off. Look at the timing here.” Jim looked at the report on the test computer screen where Luke was pointing interpreting the time stamp and status messages. “Yeah, looks like it – well spotted chief! Now we just need to figure out why. I bet, since it's only sometimes, and only from PSU on or off, that maybe it's a ground or power rail bounce at the processor, or watchdog chip. Maybe the chip is more susceptible than it's supposed to be, or maybe the hardware boys haven't decoupled it enough, but either way I suggest you show Howard and see if he can pick up anything with the 'scope, or come up with a better theory.” He looked again at the readout. “Actually mate, look here – it's only ever when the alternate PSU is switched. See here, here & here, PSU1 is switching and it's fine, and here and here PSU2 is switched and you've got the fault. I wonder if it's not the chips susceptiblity, but the circuit board power planes from PSU2 – maybe they're too skinnyfor the length of track – high resistance, causing a voltage glitch. Anyway, whatever it is, Howard will find it with that clue. That's a good find – knowing where to start looking is most of the battle.” Jim knew just enough about the various aspects of product engineering, manufacturing processes, and the typical supplier and logistic issues to be able to ask the questions that got the specialists to think along the lines that solved the problems. He didn't consider himself smart at all, but through his guidance, his teams solved the problems that others struggled with, and Luke was starting to learn the same skills. Jim was doing his thinking out loud as a training exercise for Luke. “Sure will boss, and I'll make sure to compliment Jamal on sussing the overflow bug.” Luke always referred to Jim as “boss” and Jim called him “chief”. It was their private joke. If they ever referred to the other by their real name it usually meant something serious was coming! The exception was the occasions when Luke and the others called him “Jim-san”. This was their sign of respect name for him as a result of the improved relationship with their Japanese colleagues. It was one of their many “in” jokes – they had a lot of them – Jim had fostered the team spirit specifically along a fun path. “Oh, by the way, Tim & I are on the move this weekend. Valkyrie has the nod to proceed. I'll have Joan sort the flights today. You can hold the fort while I'm away.” They had recently started using mythological beings for their project codes. The team had chosen Valkyrie for the India product – probably because the Tom Cruise movie of the same name had recently been released. “Sure thing boss, no worries, but I don't envy Tim India. At least you'll be more comfortable in Japan.” “Actually,” Jim replied, “I was thinking on the bike on the way in that I should probably tag along to India as well. We'll have a problem with the dual power supply and I'm thinking that it would be more efficient, cheaper and faster time to market for the customer if we use a local India-based PSU manufacturer and have them integrate the system from the factory with the PSU's. I've got a couple of possible suppliers lined up and want to scope them out & talk it over with them before deciding on that. Plus you know Tim's gonna need me along to keep him out of trouble!” “Delhi-belly in Mumbai eh?” laughed Luke. “Don't you want it to be like Taiwan all over again?” “I don't want him promising your first born to the customer – you know what he's like!” Jim replied heading to his desk. Dumping his bike clothes and gear on the hanger by his desk, Jim poked his laptop into life, letting it boot up while he tidied away the clothes, his papers he'd taken home and his lunch. He logged in and checked the intranet “In/Out page” to see if Tim was in yet. He needed to plan their trip and see if he agreed with both of them going to India together before they took it to Chris to OK. No sign of Tim yet, so he checked the overnight emails. Within ¼ hour he had scanned them all, forwarded the ones he could delegate and flagged the ones he had to deal with personally. They could wait 'til later, if he was going to be on a plane in the weekend, that one took priority! He was just about to check the In/Out page again when he noticed the unmistakable shape of Tim heading his way. “Tim-san!” he hailed. “How's my favourite Programme Director today Jim-san?” Tim responded. “Looking forward to a new experience – I haven't been to India yet.” “What, you think you need to hold my hand to keep me out of trouble?” “Kind-of.” replied Jim, “but if the truth were known, it's really so you don't make any rash promises to the customer.” “You are wise and knowledgeable Jim-san and you know me too well!” “Actually,” Jim explained, “I really think the timeline is going to be a problem for them and if I'm there we can work the development and prototype schedule around their needs. Plus, the PSU is going to be a problem. I was thinking we can use one of the local Indian PSU manufacturers and speed up the process and reduce the costs if they don't have to ship the PSU's to China only to be shipped back again. I reckon we can have one of the factory guys set up a test process for the PSU manufacturer and then box them in our packaging just as they'd be from our factory. India quality for India customers. All the rest of the world (ROW) unit PSU's can ship to the factory and be tested there so we can ensure Japanese quality for the ROW product. It wouldn't work if the PSU was going to be fixed internally, but this one has both units as hot-swap modules so they'll be packaged, shipped & sold seperately so it will be fairly easily to co-ordinate logistically.” “and as for my trip to Japan,” Jim continued, “I think it's better if you're there for that too as you can sell the application much better than I can. I'll do the project schedule and engineering stuff while you talk to the marketing stuff. If we do it on the way back from India, we have all the latest details from the customer, PSU vendor and our planning on the plane. From India to Japan is a relatively low extra cost and you know we always want as much time as we can get in the Tokyo office.” “You make a strong case Jim-san.” Tim agreed. “And that's without the whole taking-care-of-Tim-san after local Indian food and a night out with the customer act that you just know is gonna be needed!” retorted Jim. “Yessss!!” exclaimed Tim gleefully, “the Tim-&-Jim travelling circus is on the road again! It's been far too long!” “Yes Tim-san – as long as Chris agrees. Let's hit him up for it now so Joan has time to get the bookings in place.” “You know he's just going to rubber stamp it – as long as we both agree it's necessary he's gonna back us all the way.” “Well, maybe, but let's get that little formality out of the way so I can rearrange my life once again for you.” “Yo, big fella!” Jim waved to Tim from his place in the queue at check-in. For a change, Tim was pretty much on time, and strolled over to join Jim just as the Business Class check-in attendant motioned him forward. When you live such a long way from the rest of the world, any trip is going to be a long one necessitating the extra cost of Business Class to take advantage of the lie-flat beds and the shower in the airport lounges, to allow them to hit the ground running reasonably fresh. “Good morning gentlemen.” she smiled a greeting “Where to today?” “Mumbai” replied Jim handing over his e-ticket and passport. “Come on Tim-san, sort your mud out, the lady's waiting for you.” “Yeah, yeah” Tim exclaimed “I'm coming, I'm coming.” “So's christmas.” retorted Jim. “Hi Jim, look after my husband for me won't you?” said a voice from behind him. “Helen!” exclaimed Jim giving her a hug “Of course I will – you know that's my primary mission in life. Plenty of others have given up on that job, but you know I'm a sucker for those lost-cause charity cases!” The check-in attendant watched the back and forth banter with amusement. It was obvious the trio were good friends who had a healthy respect for each other. She marked their boarding passes for “good guy” attention. “Here you are gents, I've got you in the center row right in front of the galley, with a spare seat between you. The plane's lightly booked, so that seat won't be filled. You can use it to spread out & leave your in-flight gear on it after take off. Your bags are checked right through to Mumbai.” “Thank you very much” Jim replied “We appreciate it – I don't want to be too close to him – he smells & he snores!” She laughed as they took their boarding passes and passports. “Have a good trip.” she added as they headed off towards immigration. As they walked, Jim dug into his carry-on bag and pulled out a package. “Here you go Tim-san. Can't break the tradition now.” Helen intercepted it and checked inside the bag. It was the latest Dan Brown book “The Lost Symbol”. When Tim climbed on a plane he liked to read. Clive Cussler was usually his author of choice but this time around Jim hadn't been able to find a new one that Tim hadn't already read. When they'd started travelling together, Jim had quickly noticed Tim's ritual and had started the tradition of buying the latest book for him. With the long flight times, Tim would usually finish the book by the time they reached their destination and would need to buy another for the return leg, and if for some reason he couldn't get anything suitable, he'd often be grumpy all the rest of the trip, so Jim figured it was an investment in his own sanity to make sure he always had some reading material. “Sorry it's different this time Tim, but even with others helping, the guy just can't write them as fast as you read them.” teased Jim, “I thought you might like this one instead – I already read it!” “Wouldn't want you breaking the budget Jim” replied Helen. “At least this one doesn't appear to be about ships!” “No ships in this one Helen – this is a 'real' author, so he'll just have to make do this time!” quipped Jim. “Just because you guys don't appreciate fine literature, doesn't mean you have to drag down the master” retorted Tim. Jim chuckled. “Master of regurgitated sea shanties – there's no skill in that Tim-san! Right-o, end of the line Helen. Say good-bye to my man, and no excessive PDA – there's kids around.” Helen poked her tongue out at Jim and snuggled in to Tim “I'll Publicly Display my Affection any time I like thank you very much Mr McCully, and if you're not careful I'll go all PDA on you too!” Jim laughed giving her a very brief one-armed hug and waved over his shoulder as he stepped towards the immigration booth at the departure gate. “Don't worry Helen, I'll take good care of him – just like always. Be good 'til we're back.” Tim wrapped his wife in a real hug and gave her a quick kiss. “See you later sweets. I'll call when we get there.” She watched them both go through the gate and onto the escalator to go up to the Business Class lounge, the same as she'd done numerous times before. They all waved to each other – no big deal. These days getting into a large metal tube and thundering into the sky along with a few hunded other people travelling thousands of miles to another country, another civilisation, was no big deal. Every single day, all around the world, millions of people were doing it. And considering how unnatural it all was, it was statistically a lot safer than hopping into a car. But still, no big deal notwithstanding, she always had a small worry nagging away at the back of her head at this point, waving goodbye. As he always did while running, Jim replayed the high points from the latest problem or the previous day through his mind, analysing, problem solving and prioritising.He always thought he did some of his best thinking while running – there was plenty of time to run the various “what-if” scenarios through his mind so that by the time he finished, he usually had a pretty well thought out solution or line of attack to follow. He was 20 minutes into his pre-breakfast run and decided it was time to turn around and head back. He wanted to leave a safety margin for the unfamiliar locale. It was his first run in India. Part of his ritual – eat too much in Business Class and the airport lounge, so go for a run before the day's business started. It wasn't just for the exercise, it would also allow him to experience a little more of the local sights, sounds and smells than he'd otherwise be exposed to as well as trying to beat off the effect of the excess food & drink. In a new place, depending on the street density and lay of the land, he usually either went “out and back” which was a compromise between playing it safe on the 'getting-lost-in-strange-country' front, but not so great on the 'maximising-new-scenery' front since the “back” view was the same as the “out” view, but it was safer than the alternative “round-about” method where he tried to run a circuit with the hotel at the centre. Unless there was a good set of landmarks in relation to the hotel, the “out and back” method usually won out, although one time in Tokyo, he'd gone on a nominally “out and back” run from the hotel in Shinagawa towards the Tokyo Tower and then coming back via different streets. He almost came unstuck but the Japanese are a very helpful race and he only had to ask one person for directions before he was back on track. Since that run however, he now took with him a small “bum-bag” with his cellphone, some cash and a map if possible or at least directions for a taxi driver to get him back to the hotel. Today he was going slower than usual. India was just packed full of people! So concentrating hard, he turned around and headed back exactly the same way he'd come. He was thinking about yesterday's meeting – the first one with the customer. Tim had picked up a few more salient details about the configuration they were going to be using it in and the end job it was going to do and was changing the list of features as a result. They confirmed they had desperate need and Jim was now figuring out how they could fit the prototype schedule around their needs. There was some tie in with the PSU in this regard so today he was going to see his two most promising suppliers. A couple of blocks away from the hotel he came to a stop. The way ahead was blocked by a seeming riot of people. There was a blockage in the road – it looked like there had been an accident but who knew for sure – it could have been the normal street bustle for all he knew. The guy with the donkey cart seemed to be the guilty party, pushing and pulling at the poor beast's lead rope to get the cart moving again, but it seemed to Jim that the wheel on the cart had seized hence why the donkey was having a problem getting the cart moving again. Jim wondered whether he should divert off his safe path around the obstruction, or wait for it to clear. Being the calculated risk taker, and hater of inaction that he was, he decided to take a deteor – new sights after all. Half an hour and a few more detours than he had expected later, he was finally back on track and one block away from the hotel – well and truly later than he'd planned. In his bum bag, he heard and felt his cellphone ring. He unzipped the bag and flipped the phone open. It was Tim. “Hey sleeping beauty” Jim answered “I'm about half a block away – damn Indian traffic and confusing civic architechture is slowing me down.” “Still far too keen for my liking Jim-san” replied Tim “I've just about finished breakfast and was missing my travel buddy.” “Yeah right!” retorted Jim “How's life back home? What is it – jut after lunch there?” “Yeah, about 2pm. Helen said cooler than here – surprise, surprise! She said… ” there was a pause “hang on, … oh shit! … ” Tim's voice broke off in a howl of static. At the same time Jim was knocked off his feet by a ferocious blast of light and sound as a column of dust and debris rocketed out from the direction of the hotel. Picking himself up, Jim pocketed the cellphone and started running faster and faster towards the hotel, dreading, but knowing deep down with a sinking certainty what he was going to find. Sure enough, as he rounded the corner of the block he saw the hotel – the reception and restaurant area was no longer walled – it was broken and buckled and spread all over the place. And dotted all around were the crumpled shapes of people. Some of them moving, others ominously still. Shit! Shit! Shit! Where was Tim? Jim dashed towards the remains of the restaurant scanning the area for Tim. Others were moving in to the area as well now. Hotel staff and police from off the street. Jim's ears had been ringing from the blast, but now he started to hear the moans of the injured and the whistles and shouts of the people coming in to help. He heard a strange voice calling out for Tim, and realised that it was his voice. It sounded panicked – and he'd never been panicked before. But then again he'd never been this close to an explosion before either. Sudenly he saw him. Half buried under a table and some stones from the wall, was the head and shoulders he thought he knew. Racing over he jerked the rubble off the prone form and turned him over. It was Tim alright, and it was equally obvious that he was gone. With his forehead smashed in from one of the rocks Tim was not going to be getting out of this one with him. Jim's legs seemed to collapse and he thunked down to sit beside the crumpled body of his mate. Right now he wasn't thinking or problem solving. Right now he was just pure emotional reaction. Tears streaming down his face he arched his head back and screamed straight up at the sky a long gutteral moan that wrenched itself out from the depths of his guts. Then slowly he forced control back into his body. Nothing was going to help Tim now. Now all he could do was live, and start doing the things that must be done. He was a problem solver. He was a do-er. He flipped open his phone and started doing. “Hi hon, how's India today?” Jane answered after a couple of rings. After a long pause Jim responded with deep feeling and a shaky voice “It's shit. God I love you.” Jane instantly knew something very very bad had happened. “What's wrong hon?” After a long pause he answeed. “There's been an explosion. Tim's dead.” his voice caught and he couldn't help sobbing a bit, but he fought back the control. “I'm ok, but it's a mess here. Can you go around to Helen's place and call me when you get there. I need to tell her but I'd really like you to be there to give her some support. It's gonna be a real piece of shit for her.” Jane's mind was racing with a hundred questions churning around in her head, but she was a very practical women. She knew that Jim must be physically ok so the details could wait. She knew Helen had to be told and Jim would want to be the one to do it. He would feel responsible. “Oh my god” she said. “You're sure?” “I'm sitting here in the wreckage of the hotel beside his dead body.” Jim said “I'm sure.” Then he added “Jesus hon, I was only 2 minutes away … ” A stab of icy shock streaked up her spine and Jane's mind almost went numb with the shock of it. Bloody hell – she'd almost lost her husband. And then she realised that Helen had. And she knew she had to go. “Ok then. I'm leaving now to go to Helen's. I'll call you on the doorstep – about 15 mins time OK? I love you – BE SAFE. OK??” “Ok” was all he could muster. “thanks hon.” and he flipped the phone shut. After a few more minutes sitting there, he sighed and flipped the phone open again and started the first of the many calls he would make that day. There were practical things to do – meetings and flights to reschedule, a body to move back home, a funeral to arrange, and Valkyrie and the other projects still had to be completed. Life goes on. “Hello Ann speaking.” Ann was the HR Director and a good friend of Jim & Tim. While Jim had seen many in the HR profession acting in unhelpful ways, Ann was the embodiment of what the role can do for an oganisation. She had made some dramatic changes for the good and in the process had gained their trust and friendship. “Hi Ann, it's Jim. I really need your help. It's as bad as it can be – Tim's just been killed. A terrorist bomb most likely. I was 2 minutes away from being in it myself.” There was a stunned silence from Ann for a bit and then she responded. “Oh my god Jim, I'm so so sorry. Are you sure about Tim? Are you sure you're alright? When did it happen?” “About 10 minutes ago. I'm sitting beside his body in the wreckage of the hotel – I'm sure. I need you to co-ordinate for me. Get Luke to help. We need to get the word out to the team, we'll need to change our flight schedule, I'll need a new hotel I guess – I'm going to stay here until I can bring his body back.” Ann heard the deep wrenching sorrow in his voice and knew how hard it must be for him to hold it together while doing what needed to be done. She pictured him sitting there in the wreckage of a terrorist bombing. As much as she liked Tim and wanted to give in to the shock and sorrow herself, she was also a strong and practical woman and her mind was on the living. “Be careful Jim – is the area safe? There may be a follow-up attack. You should get out of there – go to the NZ Embassy – you'll need their help bringing Tim home anyway.” “I'm not leaving him. I promised Helen I'd look after him – I'm responsible.” “Jim,” she said gently “he's gone, and it's not your fault. You have to look after yourself now. You're no good to Helen or any of us if anything happens to you now.” Then she added into the silence “Does Helen know?” “I've got Jane on her way around there now, as soon as she gets there she'll ring me and I'll tell her – I owe it to her.” Jim replied. “Jim, remember - it's not your fault, but later on she'll appreciate you doing that. I'll set everything in motion here and then go around to Helen's as well – I think Jane will need the support too – how do think she's feeling having almost lost her husband too and then feeling guilty that she didn't while Helen did?” “Why us Ann? Why here, why now?” Jim asked the unanswerable with a deep deep sigh and his voice breaking in a sob. “Look thanks for taking care of it. I'd better go – Jane might be at Helen's and trying to call. I'll talk to you later.” “Take good care Jim” was all she could think of to say. Jim clicked the call off. After just sitting head bowed for a few minutes Ann's words about follow-up attacks registered. He looked carefully around at the destruction and the people moving around in it. In the news reports and movies about terrorist attacks, there often were follow-up attacks – sometimes the attackers diguised as rescuers for maximum effect. He didn't know how to deal with that just yet other than taking care of things himself. A policeman made his way over towards him. “Are you all right? How about your friend?” he asked concern, shock, and blood on his face. “I'm ok and my friends beyond help. Go help someone else.” Jim snapped at him. As the policeman moved on through the rubble, Jim's phone vibrated in his hand and started to ring. Glancing at the screen he saw it was Jane and he took a deep breath. This was going to be one of the hardest calls of his life and he still didn't know what he should say to Helen. “I'm here Jim” said Jane “God, are you sure you're ok? All sorts of things have been going through my mind on the way over.” Jim could hear a note of panic in her voice. “I'm fine, honestly. Some cuts and bruises is all. Now, can you go inside and hand me over to Helen?” he said gently. He could hear her crunch her way up the gravel path, knock and open the door. “Helen” she called out as she went in. He heard Helen “Hi Jane, what a surprise” and then she must have sensed something was wrong and Jim heard her say “what's wrong?”. Jim imagined Jane handing her the phone. “Helen? Hi Helen” he said “What's up Jim?” a note of caution registered in her voice. Jim got straight to the point figuring that she was starting to figure out something was dreadfully wrong “It's Tim. I failed you Helen – he's gone. There was an explosion at the hotel while I was out running. Tim must have been right in the middle of it. I'm right beside him now. I'm really really sorry – we've lost him.” He couldn't help it – telling Helen was too hard, it all came out and he started to cry. Helen didn't answer. The phone had slipped out of her hand and she dropped to the floor. Jane crouched down beside her and wrapped her arms around her as she started to scream and cry. “Noooooo! No, no, no!!!” she wailed. Half a world away, Jim was feeling much the same way. Helen's grief triggered his own and he let it come, great heaving sobs wracking his body as he crouched beside the lifeless body of his friend. Subconciously he flipped the phone shut – there was nothing more to say – even if anyone was listening. Jim stared out across the shimmering tarmac. Colourful airplanes moved busily around, landing, taxiing, taking off. The iconic control tower of Singapore's Changi airport loomed behind the terminal buildings in the distance and the heat pressed in on him from the leaden sky of another pending monsoon shower. He was airside, over by one of the freight hangars, sitting beside the transport coffin of his friend waiting for their connecting flight to be readied for the last leg home. He'd been through Changi often, and he'd even been airside with their work projects, but he'd never seen it from this perspective. The mechanisms of one of the worlds busiest airports was fascinating and normally would have captured his full attention, but Jim saw none of it except as peripheral activity, almost disconnected events. He was still operating like a robot – acting as required but largely numb. He felt unnatural, strange - like half of him was missing. But he couldn't completely break their traditions – he pulled out of his bag the battered Clive Cussler book, opened it and started reading the story out loud – to Tim. However, he found his reading patchy. He couldn't concentrate on the words. Too many random thoughts were racing through his mind – fragments of memories from previous trips with Tim, snatches of the practical world that he still had to deal with as life went on all around him, the next steps in the logistics of bringing Tim home and the funeral arrangements … There was too much to think of and he was still too weary and uncaring to focus. Putting the book down, he picked up his phone. “Hi Hon, just checking in. We're at Singapore. Just waiting for the connecting plane.” “How is everything?” Jane asked. She heard the flatness in his voice and was woried. Jim was not one to show a lot of emotion. The mere fact that in the last few days he had called her several times a day and not said much of any consequence meant that he was taking Tim's death hard. Usually when he was on a trip, he hardly ever called – a couple of times during the whole trip – certainly not a couple times a day. Not that she minded this time – until he got back she was going to be worried all the time – a close brush with death will do that for you she guessed. “Had some red tape problems but the Embassy guys took care of it. How's Helen?” “Not too good” Jane told him. “The doctor's got her on a sedative at night so she gets some sleep, but during the day she's like a zombie.” “Are you still camping out there?” “Yes, and Ann has been by every day as well. She's brought a grief counsellor along too, but I'm not sure if she's doing any good or not.” “How are the boys?” “They're fine. Big teenage boys – no problem. It's not like they really knew Tim.” Jim sighed. He was doing a lot of sighing these days – circular breathing – clear the mind. It wasn't working too well though – his mind was a whirling chaos of unhelpful questions. “Ok, well I'll be home soon. It's SQ297 by the way - see you tomorrow around 10:30. Love you.” She could tell he meant it more than usual “Love you too. Keep safe.” He flipped the phone shut. After a couple of minutes gazing into the leaden sky, Jim sighed again and flipped open the phone again. “Hi Ann” “Hi Jim, how are you?” Ann answered softly. “How do you think?” he answered flatly. “How's everything going back there? Has Luke got everything under control?” “Everything's fine Jim, stop worrying about us and worry about you. You sound like shit.” Jim gave a harsh laugh “You always know how to compliment a guy don't you?! But I guess you're right – I've got a lot of no good thoughts on my mind recently.” “Well lose them. Stop kicking yourself - it wasn't your fault.” “I know that, but it doesn't put life back in Tim's body. I can't stop the 'what-if's' and 'why's' – why him, why not me, why blow up anyone … why? why why why?” Ann replied gently “You know there's no answer for that Jim. Shit happened and we just have to go on around it. Look, when you get back I've got some red wine here with our name on it. You need to take some time out.” “Still trying to get me to burn my Leave total eh Ann?” Jim replied with a wry laugh, “We'll see. There's a lot more for me to do now with Tim gone.” “And there's plenty of other people in the team who can do it. That's what you & Tim built – now you can sit back and watch it work while you get yourself sorted out.” retorted Ann. She knew Jim exceedingly well and had discussed how to help him with the grief counsellor. She was going to have to play good cop/bad cop all by herself being gentle one minute and firm the next. “Jim, trust me – everything here is fine and under control. Half of the Japanese office will be here later tonight, Nick's already arrived from Australia, and Toyotami-san is en-route from Milan. We'll see you on the tarmac when the plane lands. The captain will bring you down the crew ladder from the air bridge and we'll be there waiting.” Jim paused and sighed again “Ok. Thanks Ann, I really appreciate this.” “No problem – you're not the only person who can organise stuff you know!” Ann replied softly again. “Take care of yourself and get some sleep on the plane. We'll see you soon.” The line clicked off and Jim hung up and flipped his phone shut. She really was the best he reminded himself again. He thought about ringing Helen, but instantly dismissed the thought. He still didn't know what to say to her. He'd see her tomorrow, and he wasn't looking forward to it. As the 747 nudged to a stop and it's engines wound down, Jim unsnapped his seat belt and stood up. He got his carry on bag out of the overhead locker and then sat back down again to wait. Almost immediately the Chief Purser arrived at his seat and asked him to come forward. When he arrived at the front door, the captain was waiting for him and straight away led him out the aircraft door into the air bridge, but instead of going along the “tube”, he handed Jim a yellow high-vis vest and a pair of air defenders, then opened the crew door in the side by the controls and led the way down the steps to the tarmac below. Off to the side of the gaggle of ground-crew, baggage trolleys and the aircraft tug, Jim could see the reception party – Jane, Helen, Ann, Luke, Nick, Toyotami-san and 2 strangers in black suits standing beside a hearse. As the captain led Jim towards the aft cargo hold, one of the groundcrew drove a mobile platform forward to meet them. The tarmac supervisor motioned to the reception party and they came out on the tarmac towards Jim. He went forward to meet them and enveloped Jane and Helen in a wordless threeway hug. They all lost their composure, weeping together. After a couple of minutes Jim could feel the hands of the others on their shoulders, patting, pressing – ofering silent support. No-one said anything. There was no need. The all knew what they meant. After a while, as they watched the crew manoevering Tim's coffin onto the mobile platform, Toyotomi-san broke the silence. “You brought him home Jim-san – that's all anyone could expect.” As the last notes of the song died out, Jim reached the pulpit at the front of the funeral chapel. He looked out at the sea of faces in front of him, then glanced over to the coffin containing his friend. “That song “Daniel” wasn't really one of Tim's favourite songs. He was more into the metal we heard from Axel Rose before. In fact I think he thought Elton John was a bit of a wimp, but that one is a song that the 'Tim & Jim travelling circus', as he called us, used to perform as a karaoke duet on our global travels together. Some of you here today from Japan and Taiwan will have had the dubious pleasure of hearing it performed in the small hours of an evening when the shochu was flowing free.” Jim glanced over at the small crowd of their work colleagues who had made the trip from Japan and Taiwan to pay their respects. Toyotomi-san, Junichiro-san, and Toko-san smiled knowingly and nodded as their minds rolled back to some of the after-work gatherings they had had. Work hard, play hard, was one of the mantra's Toyotomi-san had instilled in all his senior team members. “Thank-you - 'Arigatou'. For coming all this way to say good-b… ” his voice tailed off and broke. He couldn't yet bring himself to say the word. He gripped the edges of the pulpit and strangely enough the solidness of the smooth wood biting into his palms did help calm and ground him. Drawing a deep breath, Jim continued. “Tim was my friend. He had a lot of friends, as you can tell from the numbers here today, but somehow, he made me feel I was more of a friend than everyone else. I think he did that with everyone mind you, so why am I the one up here? I guess because I'm the last friend that Tim had when he was taken from us – I was talking to him when it happened, and if it wasn't for a silly indian and his broken-down donkey-cart, I might well have been lying there beside him.” Jim paused and looked around the room but now the crowd of people was a blur and the only face he could make out was Helen. He knew that she was flanked by Ann on one side and Jane on the other but he couldn't see their faces. Or perhaps, more accurately, he wouldn't let himself make out their faces. “Life is a mystery.” Jim went on “No-one knows why, or how long we will live for. Sometimes there doesn't seem to be a purpose, and sometimes there does. Tim seemed to have a purpose though. He enjoyed what he did, and he enjoyed at the end of it, going back to Helen. I used to give him grief about it, but Tim loved her more than anything else, and now, all I can think about is that she will be so alone, and I can't help feeling responsible. I'm so sorry Helen that I couldn't take care of him this time.” Jim stopped with a tear in his voice and in his eyes. Then with an angry swipe at his face, he continued. “Hate.” … deep breath, … “Hatred is a powerful force that can unite a multitude. You see, we are all united by hatred here today. Hatred caused someone to strap a bomb on to their body and go out to kill a bunch of strangers. And today, I bet, each and every one of us feels an element of hatred for the people who made this happen and snatched Tim away from us just as he was really getting into his stride and enjoying life.” “But, we cannot live properly if we let this hate take us. We do not honour Tim's life if we give in to the hate. Tim loved life and he would not want us to squander the rest of our days in fear and hatred. So, while it might be hard, for Tim's sake, we need to push the hate down. Down, into a little ball way down there, take a deep breath, and smile, and remember the good times, and the good things. And live each day as if it were our last – in happiness, and remembering the good times.” “I am sure I will need to be reminded of this myself, because already I miss him, and feel sad that he's not here to enjoy this lovely day and this gathering of all the people he loved, but we have to, or else he gave us nothing, and I know my friend gave me something.” “At work, he gave me the freedom to operate – I trusted him to steer the product direction and he trusted me to deliver it. He made truly wild promises to the customers – he did, didn't he? But he did because he felt he could rely on the rest of us to do the imposible – and each time we did! But it wasn't an unhappy grind because in the process, he gave me and the team a whole lot of fun. He challenged us to meet the bar he set for us and he helped make sure we could meet the challenge. I have never worked with another person who operated this way and I doubt I ever will again.” “But I'm going to miss the most his greeting. He had the knack to say your name as a greeting, and make it sound like he hadn't seen you in a million years and now that you were with him it was the best thing that had happened. You couldn't help but feel your spirits lift when he said it, and it set the tone for the rest of the conversation. It didn't matter how deep the shit, Tim was always cheerful and confident we could shovel our way out of it. I really only saw him down less than a handfull of times – and the shit was indeed VERY deep then! But I am really, REALLY, going to miss that “Jim-san!”. I think we all will.” He paused again and suddenly he felt very drained. He'd planned a lot more to say – all the funny stories of Tim's antics around the world and back home, but his mind was now blank. He breathed deep and gripped the dias again and regained some energy. He walked over to where his friend was resting and ran his hand over the smooth, shiny wooden case. “Goodbye Tim. You were always teaching me a lesson of some sort, but this one is going to take me a while to work out. Thanks for the memories – it was the best of times.” As he slowly returned to his seat, Jim heard the music start and the Monty Python “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life” took over to do what Tim would have done to lift the spirits of everyone gathered. Luke started joining in the chorus and the rest of the team picked it up – but not with their usual conviction. A quiet chorus of people trying to convince themselves. Soon everyone was standing and singing along – almost. Jim, Helen, Ann & Jane sat quietly holding hands with the weight of the world on their shoulders. The bugs were bothering him. Jim held his breath as he ducked through the tunnel of brush arching over the track. He was slogging up the bush covered hill at the old quarry which was his favourite running track, and the heat had congregated the fat-bodied flying fruit-flies at the juncture between hot and cold in the shadows at the entrance & exits to the areas where the bushy patches cloistered the track. As he neared the top and the incline of the hill increased, his pace slowed and he slowly dropped into a walk. Subconciously he noted he had started walking earlier than usual and figured he was out of practice. This was really his first run since the run in India - half a world and a whole lifetime ago. As was usually the case on his runs, Jim's thoughts ran wild, reviewing recent events, home life, work problems, things his friends had mentioned – a wide and varied stream of synapse connections. All of a sudden, Jim realised he was reliving a memory. He was recalling the conversation he'd had with Tim on the plane to Mumbai. Tim had put down the book Jim had given him and said “this whole Noetic science thing … what do you make of it Jim-san?” Jim had paused, stretched, and then pressed 'save' on the file he was working on and closed the lid of his laptop. Here was a topic he could get his teeth into! “Well, it's certainly interesting. You know I've always maintained that the power of the human mind was something we couldn't quite comprehend. Aborigines pointing the bone and the recipient shutting down and dying, the mother lifting the crashed car off her child, and the people given a death sentence from cancer who defied the odds and lived. Not so sure about the Yuri Geller types though!” “Yeah, well, it's a better theory than the christian church has.” Tim replied “You know we've been through the 'business of religion' discussion before” Jim said, “you got any new thoughts on the topic?” “Actually yeah, I have.” Tim responded. “You know last month when I was in Nepal, I got talking to our agent there about the whole subject. He's a Hindu, and he agreed about the 'business of religion' concept but was saying about 'faith' and what he believed. I got the feeling he/they were very tolerant of different beliefs, and for instance he said that while his wife liked to go to the temple every day and wanted him to go too, while he personally didn't agree with it, his attitude was that if it didn't hurt him and it made her happy then he went along with it.” “Well that's fine, but if he figured the temple was 'a business' did he have a 'faith'?” “I just said he was Hindu. He treated it as a faith seperate to a religion.” “So what's the belief? Heaven? Hell?” Jim was intrigued. “If I remember correctly, it was along the lines of do good things and you'll be all right. There wasn't really a heaven – they believe in reincarnation but when you achieve enlightenment, like the budda, you achieve oneness.” “Is that their version of heaven then?” said Jim “I guess so.” “And is there a god/creator figure?” “I guess so. He said they have this concept of 'zero' – when you achieve enlightment and then die, your spirit joins the rest of the spirits who have achieved enlightenment. Maybe these days we would call it a global consciousness or something. I got the impression it was kind of like infinite but nothing at the same time which is why they called it zero.” “What, so, at some point in time there was one, or a group, of spirit/spirits that created the world, and as time has gone by and some people have achieved enlightenment, they have joined the collective spirit creature/mass??” queried Jim. “That's the impression I got.” confirmed Tim. “I can't say I understood it then and we didn't have the chance to discuss it further. It's kind of fascinating though.” “Yerrrrr” said Jim thoughtfully. “So eternal damnation or heaven?” “Come on, you know that's the 'business of religion' working it's control factor. They believe you live your life and do your best to be a good person, and you'll be reincarnated at a suitable level for how you went. Eventually, if you keep working at it, you'll achieve enlightenment and join with zero.” Tim went on “it's a nice concept really.” “Hmmmm, yes.” answered Jim thoughtfully. “How do you think that fits with Noetic science? I checked it out on the web after reading the book. Some aspects seem to be like a business, but others truly seem to be trying to verify scientifically the power of the human mind. I guess, there's a fit with the Hindu view and the ultimate goal of 'zero'. Noetics was really saying that 'god' exists in each and every one of us, as long as we have the mind to unlock it.” Tim agreed “The Hindu, and Buddhist, belief in enlightenment really does seem to agree with the concept that god exists in each person.” Jim was thoughtful. “That's a little bit similar but yet quite different to the Japanese Shinto ancestor worship notion. There, when you die your spirit leaves the body and continues hanging around on earth. You need your living relatives to look after you in the spirit world putting offerings of food aside for you etc. If you achieved great deeds during your life you might become a god – like a mighty warrior becoming a god of war, but otherwise you needed your family to look after you. That's where the whole sense of duty in their society comes from – it's all leading up to duty to your ancestors so that when you join them in the afterlife your family would take care of you. It was a mix of faith and the business of religion.” He went on. “And the Korean belief is different again. One of the guys at Kendo told me that they have two heavens but no hell. There's a middle heaven where you go when you die. If you led a really good life helping people and being extra good you didn't stay in middle heaven very long but went straight up to the higher heaven where everything is perfect. If however you weren't so good you spend longer in middle heaven until you earn enough bonus points to get the upgrade as it were. But I don't know if this is a recent belief or the original, because I thought the Korean people were very similar to Japanese in following ancestor worship.” Tim said “well that explains some of the actions they take, but it's not as interesting a concept as the buddhist zero. I kind of like that one.” “Yeerrrrss” Jim responded thoughtfully, “but I think I'm going to need to find out some more about this before I can get my head around it fully.” Tim said “Yes. Norgay gave me a wee book about stories of the Buddha. Most of the tales seemed to be in the area of 'business of religion' rules and control. I pointed this out to Norgay and he said that of course there were people who would make anything into a religion rather than a faith, but if you looked at each story and message that the Buddha had given, there was lots of free choice there – take it or leave it kind of. For instance, the Buddha was saying that in order to achieve enlightenment, one should give away all their possessions and live the life of a beggar. But he also knew & said that if everyone did that then who would have the food to give to the beggars? And the world would fall apart, so that wasn't the only way to go. Indeed apparantly there were some followers of Buddha who did not give everything away but still managed to achieve enlightenment. I really need to read up some more about this.” Jim had said “You should talk to Ann – she loaned me the 'Tibetan Book of the Dead'. I haven't finished it but from the scan I gave it, and now that I think more about Noetics, it seems like there could well be a cross over there.” “Good idea.” said Tim. “A philosophical session with Ann sounds good. Some wine would be involved of course! And I might have to read up a bit more about Noetics. This idea that each person is a potential god is really quite powerful, and it would be interesting to see the differences & similarities between the Buddha's way and the modern science way.” “I'll see if I can find you a book on it for the return trip!” quipped Jim “But only if there isn't a new Clive Cussler - a mind trip instead of a rehashed rusty old boat trip!” The memory faded and Jim batted the midges away from his mouth and broke back into a trot as he broke out of the bush and neared the top of the ridge. He ducked off the side of the track and hauled himself up on top of a large outcrop of rock that looked out over the quarry. This was one of his 'secret' places. Most people didn't really know it was there and it had a spectacular view. He sat down on the outcrop with his feet dangling over the edge. For a while he just sat soaking in the warmth of the sun on his skin and also the heat of the rock spreading up through his body. The view of the distant houses merging into the city below and the countryside and mountains in the background set among the late spring flowering trees, shrubs and greenery helped soothe his mind. The conversation from the plane was still there in his mind, and the feeling of peace from his vantage point suddenly registered. Why on earth should he be alive to enjoy this moment and Tim wasn't? He wanted to scream and pound the rock but all of a sudden the words of Ann came to mind - “It's no-one's fault - shit happens and we have to go on.” With an effort, Jim forced his anguish down. Almost subconsciously he scooched back on the rock a bit and rearranging his legs, knelt down into seiza. He placed his hands one atop the other and made a circle under his navel - “mook-saaaaannnngggggg” he thought to himself as he practised the circular breathing from Kendo. As he breathed in, then out, his breathing slowed and his thoughts did too. Slowly he registered the warmth of the sun, the quiet background chirrup of the insects and birds, and the feeling of the peaceful surroundings. The swirling anguished thoughts disipated and while it wasn't 'no mind', his thoughts were still. He opened his eyes and looked out over the city and plains below him. It was almost like he was seeing it fresh for the first time. It really was a special view. “If Tim were here, he would've wanted a bottle of Waipara Valley Pinot Noir to enjoy it with!” Jim thought out loud and then he laughed. After a couple more seconds just sitting enjoying the view and the warm feeling of the sun on him, Jim pulled himself up and headed back to the track and back on course. Life went on, he thought. And all of a sudden he felt like it could – that it was ok to be alive and not to be stewing in a deep funk of unfairness. He almost thought he heard Tim's voice say “Come on Jim-san – harden up!” and laugh at him as he used to when turning Jim's saying back on him. His spirits lifted and he picked up his pace. It was going to be OK. As her ship crossed the orbit of the outermost sister planet, she thumbed the projector node and ended the report. Her earlier excitement was completely gone and despite having just woken from a good sleep, she felt incredibly drained and tired. Slowly she looked back out the translucent skin of her ship at the HUD-ennunciated marker that identified the planet of her concern. The analysis was thorough and the over-riding meaning from the messages contained among the plethora of RF signals emanating from the planet was umistakable. The intelligence teased out from the mass broadcast media and planetary-wide information network showed unmistakenly that the lifeform discovered was quite highly evolved, but it was a lost cause. For all their capability to control the planets resources, and reach beyond their own lands, the data showed her they were on a self-imploding path of destruction. And what was more worrying was that in the process of that self-destruction, she felt it was highly likely they would take the entire planet with them. She knew what had to be done. Getting up from her sleep platform, she moved through the ship to the flight station control centre. Setting herself into the central seat, she caused the control panel to form in front of her. Her long, slim fingers moved across the panel, setting in motion the chain of commands that would fix the current problem. Sensors swept the space ahead of them identifying every scrap of matter in the vicinity and feeding back to the ship their compositions, densities, locations and trajectories. A section of the wall became translucent and the HUD symbology picked out and highlighted certain objects that met the criteria she had defined. Projected paths of all the relavent items were projected in spiderweb thin laser light on the viewing and control pane surface. After scanning the data for a few seconds she made her choice. Digits flying now, she selected one tremendous piece of space rock which the HUD data identified as a fragment of a planet which had not formed. She manipulated her controls, causing a loud humming to commence and poweful beams to reach out towards the distant rock fragment. The beams insinuated their influence on the piece of ancient geology, pushing and prodding it to change it's course until the spidery trace of it's HUD-projected trajectory intersected the trajectory line of the jewel-like planet. With a final scan of her data, she snapped the beams off and sagged back into the padding of her couch. It was done. The rock was now on a collision course with the planet that worried her so. Within a few short days the giant rock would sweep in as a meteor blazing it's short-lived fiery path across the sky before smashing kilometers deep into the planet's crust unleashing the energy of a thousand atomic bombs in a gigantic fireball. Tons of the planets surface material would be thrown up into the atmosphere creating a sun-blocking curtain that would change the planet's weather pattern and climate irrepairably. The bi-pedal intelligent life-foms would try and stop the meteor from hitting their planet but their technology would not prevent the rock she had chosen. The size of a tiny moon, it could not be deflected from it's path or destroyed with their weapons. Her calculations showed that several millions of them would perish in the initial impact, heat & shockwave, while entire continents would be consumed by the tidal wave that followed, and the rest of them would perish over the ensuing years, due to the severe climate change brought on by the dust cloud. It was, as their own entertainment broadcasts showed, an extinction event. There was no other choice. They had had their chance. The evidence that her species had visited was visible in the historic data in the signals beaming off the planet. Over the recent thousands of their years, the more primitive societies of the planet had been visited from the stars, and they had recorded the visits subject to the limitation of their knowledge at that time. The attempts to steer them along the right path had failed - with the exception of their technology growth. But technology alone is not enough and the future projection was not good. She calculated that her work would rid the planet of the threat of this lifeform and simultaneously trigger the conditions to allow another one of the many and varied organisms that existed on the planet, to evolve into intelligence and start down the path that could result in a future meeting. She would likely not see such a meeting, but her mission would take her past other worlds with such possible meetings, and others of her kind would return to patrol this area of universe in the future. She had her mission. And she had hope. ",candidate00003
6,00001,candidate00004,"Unusual for an Australian house of the 1960s era, it had a cellar in which Gillian imagined keeping perishables. She wanted a cellar because the house design in “Modern Living” magazine, which she had read in the dentist’s waiting room, had one. But the kitchen, admittedly quite basic, had a large refrigerator so the cellar, she imagined, might come in handy once her husband could afford the wine to make it a wine cellar. Gillian liked the kitchen, at the centre of the house linked to the dining annex which she also thought of as a play area. A cleverly positioned room divider separated the kitchen and lounge room with its large floor to ceiling windows, the full width of the house. A three seater leather lounge and two armchairs were her pride of joy. Her father had made her a Tasmanian Blackwood coffee table and bookshelf. The house had a formal dining room and a small bedroom on the ground floor. Upstairs, three bedrooms with built-in wardrobes had views of the bush and the bay. The master bedroom had a luxurious floor to ceiling tiled ensuite bathroom and a walk-in wardrobe. In short, Gillian’s house was a modern, comfortable house for a modern family. Her friends admired the house very much for its open plan design and its clever use of space. Those who weren’t Gillian’s friends, called her A frame house “The Pyramid”. That was technically and geometrically incorrect, as Gillian pointed out. Envious, wagging tongues called her Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile, mostly behind her face. Gillian kept the house very tidy and true to her list, dusted on Wednesday afternoons, vacuumed the floor on Thursday and washed the kitchen and laundry floor on Saturday and smiled. At the Bowling Club annual dinner dance, which she attended to please her parents, Gillian was quite prepared to be bored stiff and sit the evening out because she was plain looking and wasn’t a very good dancer. A nice looking man, she soon found out his name, asked her for a dance, led her back to her table and quick as a flash, found another dance partner and showed off some fancy steps. He was tall, good looking, athletic and very sure of himself, Gillian thought. His name was Brian Mountjoy and he stood at the bar talking to her father, smiled and shook hands with a few people and caught her eye. He looked in Gillian’s direction again and she was pleased he did but did not like him dancing and chatting with other women. He smiled, walked over and made Gillian promise to save the last dance for him. She didn't know what to make of that move, but the disappointment on Brian’s face was plain to see when she left the club with her parents. She drifted off to sleep thinking of him, the way he had held her close and wished it had been closer. His cheek had been close to hers, trying to make conversation amid the noise of the band playing the Rolling Stones “I can’t get no satisfaction” and the noisy crowd singing along. Had he said as much? Had she said as much? No, Gillian decided. She would never admit to a lack of satisfaction, or would she? What would Brian do if she said so? How far would she let him go on their first date? Gillian was good at kissing if the experience with two boys and their say-so amounted to anything. Brian would be a good kisser, surely, and he was a man, not a boy. The more she thought about him, the more she wanted to feel his hands and would let him. Let him do what and where would they meet? Her mother answered the phone the Sunday after the dance and called Gillian to the kitchen. It was Brian and Gillian spoke to him for an hour from the extension in the lounge room. It didn't matter what Brian said. She couldn’t remember the conversation only his ever so smoky, so smooth and so sexy voice. Yes, they would have lunch on Monday. Gillian phoned her office from Brian’s flat to say that the food she had for lunch had given her an upset stomach and that she should be alright by the following day. Brian’s first kiss and touch had set her aflame and she explored his body and wanted all of him then and there. “I can’t get no satisfaction,” she whispered hungrily again and again. They spent a passionate afternoon and an exhausted Gillian took a cab home. Her mother looked at her as only mothers can and knew. Gillian went to her room, forgot about dinner, lay on her bed and put her hands to her face and body. Brian’s scent, his aftershave and sex were on her hands and on her body. She went to sleep wishing him next to her. She had become a woman that afternoon- Brian’s woman and she would see him again and be with him forever. They spent a weekend at Lakes Entrance where Brian revealed that he would have to go back to work in Bass Strait where he worked as a painter on an oil exploration platform. Gillian became part of his 10 days on-10 days off routine but living with his absence was made bearable by and having Brian around for an uninterrupted 10 days. Brian was angry, very angry at Gillian. Had she not taken precautions? It didn't matter to Gillian, for being pregnant was a joy and getting married was the logical next step, surely. Brian had no relations, well none he wanted to invite to a wedding and the bitterness in his voice made it clear that Gillian best avoid the subject. Brian wanted a Registry Office ceremony and Gillian, who had dreamt of a church wedding, reluctantly agreed to please him. Her mother looked on and her father and a mate of Brian’s acted as witnesses. The newlyweds spent a week at Lorne, which was not the Gold Cost honeymoon Gillian would have preferred, but she was married to Brian now and that, in itself, made her happy. The first few weeks at the flat were pleasant enough as they settled into a routine dictated by Brian’s work demands. It would all change, Gillian promised herself, once the baby was borne. Brian would look for a job locally, she would make him breakfast and lunch and he would be home evenings and weekends. He might, with her help, start a painting business with Gillian running the office. Then they could visit her parents more often, spend weekends at the shack, get a tan and watch the baby make sandcastles and play in the shallows. Quite unexpectedly, Gillian’s mother called at the flat one evening because, as her mother pointed out, the telephone had been disconnected. “I didn't want to trouble you at work. Your phone bill is long overdue.” “Brian pays all the bills, Mum,” Gillian explained. “He must have forgotten. I’ll pay.” “No need to, dear. You father will pay the bill. Do you have it handy?” Gillian explained to her mother that all their mail went to a post office box that Brian had kept on after they married. The following evening, Gillian answered a knock on the door. It was the landlord’s agent who handed her a business card, apologized for the intrusion, but as the rent was overdue because the cheque had been dishonoured and because letters had been returned ‘no longer at this P.O. Box’, he had no choice but to call in person. Gillian’s went to her bank the next day for cash to pay the back rent and a month in advance. She filled in the withdrawal slip and handed it and her cash card to the teller. He gave her a puzzled looked and then called for the manager: ”Is this a joke?” She nearly fainted when he told her that she had $1.19 in the account after $4,200 had been withdrawn in one transaction. The helpful bank manager spoke to her father who arranged to have her account topped up. Gillian feared the worst when her father asked her to come home for tea and ‘to sort a few things out’, as he put it. Gillian was in no fit state to drive home from her parent’s house that night after her father revealed to her and her shocked mother some disturbing news. Gillian’s credit card had been used for cash advances totalling $1,500. Her father had given Brian $2,500 of his own money to open an account at his bank. This amount was half the deposit needed to buy a two bedroom unit. Together with his savings, Brian had sufficient funds to secure a mortgage for a two bedroom unit. He had sworn Gillian’s father to secrecy as the purchase was meant as a surprise to celebrate the baby’s birth. Because her husband was not due home for two days, Gillian decided rather than wait and fret, to make enquiries. The real estate agent gave her the returned letter. It was addressed to Mr. B. Miller c/o a local post office box. The Postmaster revealed that he had cancelled the box because of non payment. There was further disturbing news when Gillian called at the exploration company’s head office. There was no history of a B. Mountjoy or B. Miller working on the company’s offshore platform. Gillian that evening searched the flat, every drawer, cupboard, wardrobe and shelf. There was nothing connecting her husband with the flat. An anxious Gillian waited for Brian’s footsteps and the sound of him whistling which told her he was in a good mood. He put his suitcase down, embraced her, swung her around gently as he always did and kissed her passionately. They went out for a counter tea and to the movies. “I had a bit of a scare with the baby,” she lied as they lay in bed awake. “I couldn’t even contact you because I have no phone number.” “Is the baby alright?” “Nothing to worry about, sweetie. Just in case I need you, who do I speak to at the company?” “Just leave a message for me at Port Welshpool. They’ll get in touch by radio.” But Gillian wasn’t that easily put off and asked: “In what name?” “What do you mean, what name?” “There is no B. Mountjoy working on the oil rig,” Gillian stated. “Or a B. Miller.” Brian turned away from her and that worried Gillian. His answer was slow in coming. “Oh that,“ Brian laughed it off. “I can explain. It’s a tax thing. I work two jobs. Seven days on the platform and three days in Lakes Entrance painting. It’s simply a case of dodging tax.” Gillian didn't believe his explanation but avoided probing for fear of more dubious explanations or worse: making her husband angry. They had never argued, never had there been any ill feeling between them. She loved her husband and wanted him around. “So who do I ask for when I want to get in touch with you?” His evasiveness brought her close to tears. “Well?” “Well what?” “Who do I ask for?” “I got fired. I haven’t been on the platform for a month.” Gillian wanted to scream: where have you been all this time? If you were out of a job, where did you stay? What have you done with my money? Is there someone else? She didn't want a confrontation and just lay silently. For the first time in their married life, they didn’t kiss each other good night. Breakfast was interrupted when the power went out. Gillian looked at her husband accusingly and said: “I suppose they’ll cut the gas off next. I don’t get paid till Friday.” “I’ll take care of it,” Brian declared. “Thank you. And how will you spend your day while I’m at work?” Brian gulped down his coffee, put on his coat and walked out. The front door slammed shut. Another first, Gillian thought, walking away without explanation. “Not good enough Brian,” she mumbled under her breath. If her husband was reluctant to explain then she had to find some answers. She opened his suitcase and went pale at the sight of bundles of cash - mint fresh banknotes. Gillian took $9,000, the money Brian had taken from her accounts, her father’s gift to him and for bills paid. She didn't want to know how much was left in the suitcase or where or how her husband had come by what looked like many thousands more. She gave in to the urge to search the suitcase for explanations and opened a large yellow envelope. A birth certificate for Brian Mountjoy, two marriage certificates in addition to her own and rates notices for two properties made her uneasy. There were three drivers’ licenses with three different names and five credit cards in different names in a worn wallet. There was also a photo album. Gillian turned to the last page and saw a woman’s smiling face, a toddler holding her hand and Brian standing besides her. There was also a bundle of letters with handwritten addresses and a few unopened invoices addressed to a post office box she knew and one she didn't. Did it matter that her husband had a past? What man didn’t? What mattered to Gillian now was the present, the future and honesty in their relationship. Gillian copied the addresses on the rates notices - just in case. She picked up the phone and thankful for dial tone, rang her office to say that she would be an hour late because of urgent family business. She took a taxi to her father’s bank and deposited $9,000 into his account. She found it difficult to concentrate on work and was quite uncertain of her next step. A confrontation now or later? The truth, a candid explanation, more secrets or walking out? The baby’s kick decided the matter. She would return home and let matters run their course. But she would tell Brian about taking the money from his suitcase-if he asked. Gillian was grateful that the power was on and prepared the evening meal as though nothing had happened. She ate alone during the 7 o’clock TV news and went to bed at 10.30. She woke briefly when she felt the mattress move, gagged at the smell of stale beer and cigarettes, hurried to the toilet and vomited. Another first, Gillian noted: a drunk husband. He was still in bed when Gillian left for work. A phone call from her father, just before leaving work, unsettled her. Brian had called on him at the bank for money to pay solicitor’s fees and conveyancing costs. When her father offered to pay the bills, Brian at his most persuasive manner, explained that it was a matter of saving face. He didn’t want someone else paying his bills. But his father-in-law refused to give him cash and Brian left empty-handed. Should she ask her husband why he needed cash from her father when there was so much cash in the suitcase, Gillian wondered. Brian had his good reasons she decided and she would not mention the phone call from her father. A nice steak, pepper gravy and a bottle of cabernet sauvignon would surely get him into a good mood. But Brian, his face red with anger, stood in the middle of the kitchen, screamed at her and blamed her father for the house and land deal falling through. Gillian feigned surprise and wanted to know more. But Brian refused to be drawn, saying only that he couldn’t be bothered building them a house now that her father had spoiled everything. “It’s not too late,” she offered. “You can still surprise me. Show me the block where you want to build. Please, darling.” But Gillian’s attempt to placate her husband had the opposite effect. He became angry, refused to reveal his plans because now he didn't have the money. “But you’ve got all this cash,” Gillian said and wished he hadn’t. But it was too late. “You’ve been snooping! You have no right to my things. How dare you? The money isn’t mine, you stupid cow,” Brian screamed, his face red and distorted with rage. He grabbed Gillian by the shoulders and when she tried to push him away, he smacked the side of her face. She didn't see a punch coming or feel the impact of her head against the edge of the sink. She was unconscious and oblivious to the kick to her abdomen and another to her side as her husband lost all self control. He slammed the front door so hard the glass broke. He returned from the pub and found Gillian lying where she had fallen. He picked her up, put her in the car and dropped her off at emergency. “She had a fall,” he explained and left. He had the decency at least to telephone Gillian’s parents. “She’s in a coma,” the doctors advised the distraught parents. “She’s had a terrible beating. There is a worrying swelling of her brain. We don’t know as yet the extent of inquiries to the foetus. We are also concerned about her right kidney.” Gillian’s mother visited her daughter at the hospital every day for ten months and while still in a coma, Gillian gave birth to a female child. Because there was no certainty that Gillian would any time soon regain consciousness, the child was placed into immediate care and adoption. When Gillian awoke from her coma, the doctors and her worried mother realised that all was not as it should be. Gillian did not know who she was and apparently, had no memory of the events that had resulted in her hospitalisation. When she had difficulty falling asleep and seldom getting a good night’s sleep, her doctor prescribed luminal tablets. She remembered getting married. The baby! “What happened to my baby?” Neither Gillian’s mother nor the hospital staff, if they had answers, revealed what happened at the hospital. Gillian moved in with her parents and over many weeks slowly recovered from her trauma. She had nightmares, difficulty sleeping and on doctor’s advice, started taking medication again. On her first outing, without realising why, Gillian drove to the flat where she and Brian had lived. She had a key in her handbag, let herself in and sat at the kitchen table. The memories flooded back. The argument with Brian. She felt her cheek and realised that on that day, she had experienced another first: physical, domestic violence and she wondered what she had done to provoke her husband into an assault. There were no dishes in the sink, the tea towel hung on the oven rail and the tea caddy still had tea. There was milk in the fridge, cheese, cream and butter. Butter? Gillian wondered. She never liked butter, never bought butter. She wandered into the bedroom where an unfamiliar dressing gown hung on the hook behind the door. The shoes on the rack were not her size. A key turning in the front door and the door shutting put an end to Gillian’s curiosity. Two women stared at each other, surprised, bewildered and at a momentary loss for words. “What are you doing in my flat?” “What are you doing in my flat?” “It’s my flat,” Gillian replied. “No, it’s not,” the other woman argued. “My husband and I live here. Get out!” “Rubbish,” Gillian asserted herself. “Brian and I live here. See, I have a key.” “Brian? My husband’s name is Brian,” the other woman replied. “Brian Mountjoy?” “No, Brian Miller. I am Julie, his wife.” “Does your husband work on an oil rig, 10 days on and 10 days off?” “How do you know that?” “Well, my Brian does. And that’s him in the photo,” Gillian said and pointed to a photo in a cheap frame. She felt too ashamed to revel to a stranger that Brian no longer worked on the oil rig. “Hang on. I have seen a photo of him and you before. With a toddler. A photo in his suitcase.” “That’s our daughter, Melissa. She’s at the crèche at the moment.” “How long have you been married to Brian?” Gillian asked. “Three years.” “And you?” “Just over a year,” Gillian replied. “But I haven’t seen him for months.” “How come?” “I have been in hospital for ten months and recovering for a few weeks,” Gillian revealed. “I think you should leave now,” The other woman said, icily. “You are going to cause trouble and we don’t need you interfering.” “I’ll leave but I’ll be back. He won’t get away with dumping me for you. He’s my husband and we had a good life together.” “Out! Get out!! I don’t want you here when Brian comes home!” the other woman yelled and went to open a drawer. “He’ll be home soon and you have to go. Leave now or else!” She menaced Gillian with a carving knife, came forward and yelled: “Piss off or else.” When Gillian refused to budge, the woman stabbed at her but Gillian was quick, seized her harm, twisted it and pushed the knife into the woman’s side. Blood gushed out when Gillian pulled the knife clear. “Help me,” the woman begged. “Stop the bleeding.” The tea towel, pressed to the side, soaked with blood, failed to stem the flow. Gillian rushed to the bathroom, returned with a towel to help the woman, now slumped on the kitchen floor. Her face was pale as she lay in a widening puddle of blood. The telephone rang and a panicked Gillian let it ring out. But soon it rang again, insistently. “Hello.” “Is that you, Mrs. Miller?” “No, her neighbour.” “Melissa is here at the crèche. Is she going to pick her up?” “Oh! I forgot, I was meant to pick her up. I can’t come right now, no way. Not for another half hour. If I pay for a cab, will you bring her home, please?” “Oh, alright. But just this once,” “Thank you. Thank you very much.” By the time the front door bell rang, Gillian had washed the kitchen floor and eliminated the blood trail from the kitchen to the bedroom where she left the lifeless woman. Gillian answered the front door, ushered the child inside and thanked the crèche manager who refused payment as she had come in her own car. Gillian’s mother was surprised to see her daughter and the little girl who happily played with Gillian’s old toys. “I’m looking after Melissa while her mum’s in hospital,” Gillian explained. “Is her mother someone from work?” her mother wondered. “Yes,” Gillian lied. “And I’ll look after the toddler. With your help.” “For a moment I thought you had kidnapped a child to…” her mother said and laughed off the thought. “Very funny, Mum,” Gillian rebuked her mum and smiled. “I have to go to back to Julie’s flat to pick up some things for her to take to the hospital. Don’t wait up for me.” Gillian turned to Melissa, smiled and cuddled the child. “Your mum won’t be long and if you’re a good girl, you can have ice- cream. Would you like that?” At the flat, Gillian ignored the dead woman in the bedroom, found Brian’s suitcase and broke the look with a screwdriver. There was no money. A loaded sawn-off shotgun, cartridges, a ski-mask, gloves and a bunch of keys startled her. Maybe it wasn’t Brian’s suitcase at all? Yes, that must be so, she decided. She had believed him when he told her that the money she had found before wasn’t his. After dark, Gillian drove her Datsun Bluebird onto the footpath, as close as she could to the front door. No one saw her dragging the dead woman to the car and lift her, with some difficulty, into the boot. She knew just where to dump the body: the Blairgowrie back beach where she dug a shallow grave with a metal hearth shovel she had found in the flat. Gillian showered, put on one of the dead woman’s nighties and dabbed on some of her perfume. Now all she had to do was wait, in bed with the lights off. Brian would be home soon, perhaps he was working late? Gillian woke when the front door slammed shut. Brian was in a good mood. She could tell from his was humming and she soon felt his weight on the mattress. Brian did just what she wanted: his hands searched under the nightie for her breast and she pushed hard against his erection. “Geez, Julie, you’re tight,” he whispered and moved rapidly against her from behind and soon spent, lay on his back and snored. He had been drinking and smoking but that was a small price to pay, Gillian decided, for the happily married life soon to be hers, again. She would have to break it to him gently in the morning: about Julie leaving him and dumping the kid. How would she know why? It was Julie who upped and left when she found out about him being married to Gillian. But the explanation would have to wait. Gillian woke at 7 o’clock and Brian had already left the flat and that was a surprise. His suitcase was beside the bed. Gillian needed to know, opened it and what she had anticipated and feared was true. She remained in the flat all morning, always within earshot of the radio, listening and hoping not to hear the news that told her what she didn’t want confirmed. “What the fuck are you doing here?” Brian yelled. His face, at first ashen when he found Gillian sitting at the kitchen table, turned an ugly red. “Where’s my wife?” Gillian could have challenged him, replying ‘I’m your wife’. But instead she gave a rehearsed explanation. “Julie’s gone. For good. She dumped you.” “So, last night?” Brian was perplexed. “Me. You made love to me,” Gillian answered. “It’s good to be home.” “This is crazy!” Brian screamed, headed for the bedroom and shut the door. When he returned, Gillian had a cup of coffee for him. “Just as you like it,” she declared. Brian sat at the kitchen table, scratched his head and lost for words, slammed his fist on the table. Gillian sat quietly, anxious not to provoke her husband. “Turn off that fucken radio.” Gillian complied then picked up her purse and a shopping list. “We’re out of fruit and vegetables and there is no meat. What do you want for tea?” “Nuthan. I won’t be in till late,” Brian replied. “Don’t wait up.” Gillian’s mother was concerned about the fretting child. She had asked no questions, even though she wanted to know where the child’s father was. Gillian, when she was ready, would explain. She was relieved when Gillian rang. “I really think you should take Melissa to see her mum. The child is very upset.” “Please tell her that I’ll pick her up soon,” Gillian replied. “Promise?” “Promise,” Gillian replied and put the phone down. “I’m on my way.” Melissa seemed happy to be home but Gillian couldn’t satisfy the child’s insistent and whining ‘I want my mummy to come home’. “Soon,” Gillian reassured the child. “She’ll be home soon and your dad will be here too.” “I don’t like him,” Melissa said. “Make him go away.” “You must not say that, Melissa! Be nice to your daddy.” “He’s not my daddy,” she complained and added: “Who are you?” “I’m Gillian. I’m looking after you while your mummy is in hospital.” “Hospital?” “Your mummy is sick. That’s why she is in hospital,” Gillian explained Brian was still asleep when Gillian took Melissa to crèche. She was a bright child who knew the way and made Gillian promise to pick her up. Melissa ran up to the crèche gate and called out, ‘Three o’clock.’ On the way back to the flat, Gillian bought steak and sausages and new potatoes with her own money, just in case Brian needed dinner. He had left $3,000 on the kitchen table, crisp new notes and unopened window face envelopes, bills for electricity, gas, telephone and another from the landlord’s agent. They were addressed to Mr. B. Miller at a local Post Office box. All the bills and also the rent, were overdue but Brian’s money was sufficient. He was a good provider, Gillian reasoned but not very capable at managing the household. Never mind, she sighed, all that was in the past for she would take care of the house and little Melissa. By the time she had paid the bills and called in at the real estate office to pay the rent and three months in advance, it was time to collect Melissa. Gillian waited at the kerb, not wanting to meet the crèche staff again. Melissa smiled and when Gillian bought her an ice cream, soon forgot about visiting her mum in hospital. Over time, Gillian imagined, Melissa would get used to Gillian as her new mum. When she was old enough to understand, Gillian would tell her about her mum abandoning her. Meanwhile, Gillian was determined to be a good substitute. She ignored the telephone and when it stopped, rang her mother who was happy to learn that all was well. When the phone rang again, Gillian unplugged it. Brian did not come home that night or the night after that. He’d be home on the weekend for sure, Gillian wished. She listened for the door and hurried to hang out the washing for she wanted to look her best, the perfect, immaculately dressed wife, ready to greet an adoring husband. It wasn’t Brian wanting to come in. He had a key. When the insistent knocking on the front door became louder and louder and when Gillian could no longer stand it, she opened the door a crack. “Yes?” “Is Julie home?” “Nobody by that name lives here,” Gillian replied. “But this is their flat,” the middle aged man insisted. “We know she lives her. We are her parents.” “I assure you,” Gillian said calmly and persuasively, “I live here on my own.” “I’m Julie’s mother. I haven’t heard from her in days. We know that Melissa still attends crèche and someone who is not Julie picks her up.” “I’m sorry, I can’t help you,” Gillian replied and closed the door. “We’ll be back,” Julie’s father threatened. Gillian took Melissa to her parent’s house and returned after dark, grilled the steak and had it with boiled potatoes. Loud banging on the front door nterrupted her peace, but she ignored the demands. “Open up. We know you’re in there. The police will be here in a minute.” “Go away!” Gillian picked up her purse, left by the back door and stood in the side drive, near the rubbish bin. The Police didn't come and when the visitors took off in their car, Gillian returned to the flat and went to bed. She awoke to loud talking in the flat. Brian came into the bedroom and whispered: “Say nothing to the Police. My name is Miller. You are my girlfriend. Leave the talking to me.” But Gillian thought it best to answer the detective who asked what she knew about the missing Julie Miller and her daughter Melissa. Gillian answered truthfully that she had lived in the flat for only five days. She had lied to Julie’s parents about Brian living in the flat because she was too embarrassed to tell strangers about living with her boyfriend. With the Police gone, Brian let fly. “They think I’m responsible for Julie’s disappearance. I’m not and I can’t afford them snooping around here. The child is still going to crèche and someone is still picking her up. Julie would never leave without the child.” “I’ve told you. She’s dumped you and I don’t know where Melissa is,” Gillian replied. “How do you know her name?” a suspicious Brian asked. “From her parents. They came to the flat yesterday,” Gillian answered, proud of her quick thinking. “Julie’s parents won’t give up. The police will find out who picked Melissa up from crèche. They’ll be back and I’ll…..” “You’ll what?” “I’ll have to come up with explanations. Something I don’t want to do. They might come back with a search warrant. They could even be watching the joint,” Brian feared. “If that is so, you’ll want to be rid of the evidence. What’s in your suitcase for instance,” Gillian said. “You would get rid of evidence for me?” “Sure. You’re my husband and with Julie out of the way, we’ll be happy. Won’t we?” “Out of the way? Why did you say out of the way?” “I didn't,” Gillian argued. “Yes, you did. Out of the way you said.” “I meant gone. Julie’s gone,” Gillian replied. “That’s what I meant.” “The suitcase. Find a safe place for it,” Brian urged. “The police won’t be watching me,” Gillian said to put Brian’s mind at rest. “You’ll be alright. And then, you’ll get yourself a regular job,” Gillian proposed. “What do you mean?” “Regular. Wages, salaries, steady hours. No more bank and TAB jobs.” “You know?” Brian asked in amazement. “And you never asked?” “I read the papers. Thankfully you never did over banks in Victoria. No one got killed. Your secret is safe with me.” “It’s not that simple. I have a partners and he…” Brian hesitated and insisted. “Go now. Go!” Two detective constables were indeed watching the flat and noted Gillian’s departure, the suitcase and the Datsun’s registration number. “What’s in the bag?” I wonder. “Nothing too heavy, by the look of it,” his colleague observed. “She won’t be going far.” Little Melissa was happy to see Gillian and Gillian’s mother was much relieved. She looked questioningly at the suitcase. “Just stuff I need to store for a while,” Gillian explained. “Mum, do you know where my tennis bag is?” “It’s in the junk room,” she replied. Gillian rummaged through years of accumulated stuff, found her tennis bag, tossed rackets and balls into a corner and went to her bedroom with it and the suitcase. She put it at the foot of her bed and stared at it. “Right”, she mumbled, “you leave me no choice.” During the twenty minute drive back to the flat, Gillian considered her next move, what Brian might say and her replies. It would all work out, she reassured herself. Brian’s crime spree would come to an end now that she knew of it. Gillian looked at the tennis bag and smiled. Just in case. The detectives, still observing the flat, noted Gillian’s arrival, the tennis bag in hand and the female child. “Is mummy home?” “Not for a few days, sweetie,” Gillian replied, picked up the child and tickled its ribs which made the child squirm in delight. “Got a lovely surprise,” Gillian teased. Melissa saw Brian asleep on the living room lounge. “I don’t like him,” she whispered. “Let’s go back to your house.” “No. This is your place. Brian will be nice to you. I promise.” “I want my mummy,” Melissa whimpered and started crying which woke Brian. He rubbed his eyes, looked at Melissa and then at Gillian. “What the fuck’s going on?” “Please don’t shout and swear in front of the child. She’s upset enough as it is,” Gillian said. “So it’s you! You’ve had Melissa all the time? You’ve been taking her to crèche?” “Yes, I had no choice. She’s been at my parents’ house on and off.” “So where is Julie?” “I told you! She’s dumped you,” Gillian insisted. “I don’t believe you. She would not leave the child behind,” Brian asserted. Banging on the front door and the call “Police” put an end to the conversation. Gillian rushed to the bedroom and tossed the tennis bag on top of the wardrobe. “You’ll have to answer the door,” Gillian said. “I’m not letting them in. Not without a search warrant,” Brian replied, walked to the front door and called out: “What do you want, copper?” “Is Melissa in the flat?” “Fuck off, copper.” “We’ll have a search warrant in half an hour. Just don’t do anything stupid.” Gillian refused to answer all questions the police put to her at the station. Brian was truthful in saying that he had nothing helpful to say. Melissa was released into her grandparents’ care. Gillian and Brian were released without charge but that was not the end of the matter, the Detective Sergeant threatened. Charges would be laid soon and the investigation would continue but for the moment, the police had nothing on which to hold them. Brian and Gillian sat in silence in a cab on the way home but Gillian knew that Brian was irate. He had just unlocked the front door when a voice behind them called out: “About bloody time.” The unexpected visitor slammed the car door of his Kingswood Station Wagon shut and came to the front door. “Go ahead inside, love,” Brian said to Gillian. “Bert and I have things to discuss.” Whatever they discussed, Gillian knew by Brian’s jaw set hard and from his frown, that it was not of benefit to her. But they surely would work things out. They were husband and wife who like any other couple had their ups and downs. But Brian shattered all her illusions. “Bert’s got a job planned. I need…” “No. Please Brian. Put an end…” “Shut up. I owe him. You would not understand. I don’t expect you to,” Brian snarled. “I am entitled to…” “No. You are not entitled to anything. I will tell you this much: I only agreed to marry you because I thought your father had money. Rich banker? Fat chance. But I found out too late. By the way I was already married then. I love Julie. I also have a wife in Lakes Entrance but we separated before I met Julie. I just can’t be bothered getting divorced. It was easier to get a new name. But you know that anyway from what’s in the suitcase. So where is my wife?” And with that, Brian grabbed Gillian by the shoulders and shook her violently. “Where is Julie? Tell me, you bitch! Where is Julie?” “Gone. She dumped you!” The smack with Brian’s open hand to the side of her face was unexpected and hard. It stung Gillian’s cheek and split her lip. “She’s gone,” Gillian replied, ran to the bathroom and locked the door. “Open the door, Gillian. Please,” Brian asked, a reasonable tone in his voice. “I’m sorry I hit you. It’s all getting on top of me, what with the police and Bert and Julie missing.” “Is that a promise?” Gillian almost begged. “Please don’t hit me?” “Promise. I promise. Just get the suitcase back,” Brian demanded. “Fine. Let’s just calm down. I’ll be out in a moment. Let’s have a coffee,” Gillian replied. “I feel like a beer.” “There is none in the house,” Gillian replied. “I’ll get some from the bottle shop,” Brian said. Gillian knew what was coming. Brian would drink a longneck and another and another till he was tanked. He would never assault her again. Never. There would be a new first in her marriage, Gillian decided. With Brian was out, she had crushed a dozen luminal tablets with the back of a teaspoon and waited until Brian had drunk two bottles. Gillian poured the crushed sleeping tablet powder into a new bottle. Brian finished that bottle too and never noticed the taste. He was soon comatose, slumped on the lounge. Gillian smacked the side of his face, gently at first. He didn’t wake and she smacked him harder. He mumbled in his drugged stupor and raised a hand in defence. Gillian sat calmly and confronted her future with a drunk for a husband, a thief, a deceiver, a bank robber, adulterer and bigamist. She smiled at thinking of her husband as a trigamist, if there was such a word. She really felt sorry for Julie and the accidental death. Soon the police would come knocking on her door. No amount of cleaning could erase traces of her blood on the kitchen and bedroom floors. Gillian stood on a kitchen chair and reached for the tennis bag on top of the wardrobe. All was ready for the suicide. The shotgun was loaded, a cartridge in each barrel. “Sorry, Brian,” Gillian whispered as she lay the weapon on Brian’s chest with the short barrel under Brian’s chin. She grasped his right hand and forced his thumb on the trigger and pulled. Nothing! She tried again with the safety catch off, closed her eyes, averted her face and pulled Brian’s thumb against the trigger. Gillian undressed in the bathroom and showered to wash Brian’s splattered blood from her face and hands. She stuffed her bloody clothes and the bath towel into the tennis bag. Gillian walked into the sitting room with eyes closed and never looked back as she gently closed the front door of the flat with all lights on. Gillian ate a meal of fish and chips in Frankston and put the empty beer bottle and the greasy paper in a rubbish bin in front of the take-away shop and dropped the tennis bag in a skip behind the supermarket. The police returned with a search warrant the day after questioning Brian and Gillian. They forced the flat’s front door when their demands to open up went unanswered. There was little of Brian’s head left. Some of his brains and skull bones were embedded in the plaster wall and blood had soaked into the lounge cushions. The detectives had little doubt about what had happened: A suicide after a bout of drinking. Forensic examiners found blood on sofa, cushions and blood splatter on the wall behind the sofa, consistent with a shotgun blast to the head. There were blood traces on the kitchen lino and blood stains in the bedroom carpet. It lent credence to the theory that Brian had murdered his wife and then, in remorse, had committed suicide. But where was Julie’s body? According to Julie’s parents, their daughter’s marriage had been a happy one. Julie had never complained about violence. Still to be determined was the identity of the woman who had picked up Melissa from the crèche. A young, nosy and eager detective decided to investigate who had taken Melissa to and from the crèche. Something, he decided, what not right. His colleagues were satisfied that Brian Miller had committed suicide after doing away with his wife. Was Gillian an accomplice? The crèche manager recalled the day, a telephone conversation with Julie’s supposed neighbour and a woman who had answered the door at the flat where Melissa lived. Now that the detective had a date for Julie Miller’s disappearance and his suspicions more aroused still, knew his next move. The Datsun’s registration number gave him Gillian’s address and armed with a search warrant, found Melissa at the home of Gillian’s parents. In the boot of Gillian’s Datsun, the police found blood stains. In the shed, police found a suitcase with its most incriminating contents, notably bank notes traced to a National Bank hold-up in Deniliquin, NSW. Before long, one Albert Denning confessed to being an accomplice. His name, address, phone number and details of his share of hold up proceeds were neatly kept in Brian Miller’s diary. The pair had robbed four banks and held up five TAB Agencies in NSW. Gillian admitted that she had placed the suitcase in the shed. She could hardly deny this as her mother had seen her with it. The crèche manager positively identified Gillian as the woman with Melissa. The blood in the Datsun’s boot was of Julie’s blood group. The police had sufficient evidence, Gillian was charged with Julie Miller’s murder and tried in the Supreme Court. Still under investigation was Brian Miller’s suicide that looked increasingly like murder with Julie as the main suspect. But because the luminal drug, found in Brian’s stomach was the only circumstantial evidence, Gillian was not charged. Gillian would not confess, pleaded not guilty to murder and took the stand. A packed court heard that on the day in question, Gillian had found a woman stranger in her flat. This woman then attacked her with a knife, Gillian defended herself and managed to escape unharmed and spent the night at her parents’ place. On returning the following day, the woman was gone and Gillian thought no more of the event. Under questioning, Gillian admitted knowing Melissa but denied abducting her. Why would she? Melissa was her daughter! An astonished prosecutor and Gillian’s barrister looked at each other. The judge made some quick notes. Gillian’s mother sobbed softly and left the court in deep despair as Gillian continued with her story. A stunned court heard that Gillian expected her husband Brian to return shortly after 10 days working on the oil platform. “He is a good provider but sometimes forgets to pay the bills. We plan to buy some wine for his cellar. Also, he will redecorate our A-frame house. He is a very good painter, you know.” The judge adjourned proceedings and called the prosecutor and defence to a conference in his chambers. He strongly advised the prosecutor and defence to reconsider Gillian’s plea or adjourn the case pending a psychological assessment. After a 10 day adjournment, the psychiatrist testified that in his opinion, Gillian Mountjoy was delusional and of unsound mind. “Is the accused putting on an act?” the judge asked. “No.” The defence barrister asked for an adjournment, which the judge granted, to confer with his client and within the hour entered a new plea of ‘Not Guilty of manslaughter due to mental impairment.’ “Does you client understand what she is pleading?” the judge asked in his chambers. “I cannot be certain, your honour,” the defence replied. The judge, after another psychiatric assessment, sentenced Gillian Mountjoy to indefinite confinement in a secure mental institution. “I want you to be certain that what you’re doing is best for you,” Mrs. Arnold said to her daughter. “You may not like what you find.” “I realize that, Mum, but I need to know about my biological parents,” Sylvia replied. “And I’ll support you, no matter what,” the mother assured her adopted daughter. Sylvia’s first move, to apply for her adoption file, was the easy step. After waiting patiently for access, Sylvia accepted well meaning advice: seek counselling as the next step in the process. The file revealed that Gillian Mountjoy nee Carrington had given birth to a daughter who was placed in the care of her adoptive parents at birth. The hospital file entry ‘… incapable of caring for the infant.’ raised questions and Sylvia was determined to find answers which were agonisingly slow in coming as she pieced together snippets of information. A digitised newspaper edition was the breakthrough she so desperately needed. Sylvia now had a thread o follow and soon read the transcript of Gillian Mountjoy’s trial. She hesitated for weeks to contact the detective for information about her father. He asked for a meeting with Gillian’s mother and the adoption counsellor before meeting Sylvia. All agreed that Sylvia finding out about the circumstances of her father’s death was premature, considering that she had not yet met her biological mother. “You have visitors, Mrs. Mountjoy,” the nurse said. “Cleopatra. I am Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile,” the inmate replied. “Please remember that, Kathryn.” “You’ve never had visitors since I’ve been here.” “Oh, I yes I have. My husband Brian will be back again soon from Bass Strait. He works 10 days on, 10 days off. I miss my mother. She died seven years ago. She always remembered my birthday. What day is it today, Kathryn?” “It’s Thursday, Cleopatra.” “I must do the vacuuming if it’s Thursday. I can’t have visitors in a dusty house. Quick Kathryn, give me a hand.” The nurse found the toy Hoover and pretended plugging it in. Gillian made the vacuum cleaner noise and ran it over the carpet in the hall, the sitting room and the kitchen/dining area. “I think I’ll do the bedrooms next week in case my daughter comes to visit,” Gillian said. “I’ll just go and show your visitors in,” the nurse said and beckoned Sylvia and her mother into the room. “This is Sylvia and her mum, Mrs. Arnold.” Gillian smiled and said: “Pleased to meet you. I don’t get many visitors now. You have a fine daughter Mrs. Arnold. I have a daughter, she is a redhead too and she’d be about your age, Sylvia.” Sylvia was at a loss for words as she stared at her real mother. Gillian was 42 years old and as Sylvia knew, had spent the last 20 years at the asylum. Gillian’s skin was pale, she had no wrinkles and shapely well manicured fingers. She wore no makeup and her hair had greyed a little. Her grey-green eyes worried Sylvia. Gillian gazed, yes, it was a gaze, not a direct look, a gaze at a point in the distance. “My husband Brian will be here soon. He works 10 days on, 10 days off on an oil platform in Bass Strait. He is a painter, you know. He will decorate our A-Frame. The bedrooms really need painting before my daughter comes. But first, we’ll go to Rutherglen for some wine. He earns good money you know. We can afford to stock a wine cellar.” “How long have you had the A-frame?” a curious Sylvia asked. “A long time. My father built it and some of the furniture too. My friends admire the house very much for its open plan design and its clever use of space. Those, who aren’t my friends, call my A- frame house The Pyramid. That is technically and geometrically incorrect. They call me Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile, mostly behind my back but I got used to it. I keep the house very tidy. I dust on Wednesday afternoons, vacuum the floor on Thursdays and wash the kitchen and laundry floor on Saturdays.” “We’d love to visit your house, wouldn’t we, Sylvia?” “Come, come,” Gillian urged and walked to the corner of the room nearest the window. “Come right in. I’ll show you the cellar too.” “But it’s…..” Sylvia said. “It’s a lovely house. So unusual for an Australian house to have a cellar,” Mrs. Arnold said. “We’ll come again when you’re not so busy.” “Good-bye, Mrs. Mountjoy,” Sylvia said. “Call me Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile.” Mother and daughter left the asylum with Sylvia in tears. “The poor woman,” Mrs. Arnold lamented. “She lives in a doll’s house.” “Only in her mind,” Sylvia added. “I guess I’ll inherit the doll’s house?” “Only if you want to be Cleopatra’s daughter.” “You know what, Mum? I think, I’ll leave asking about my father for a while,” Sylvia decided. “That, my dear, is a wise decision. He might be a pharaoh?” “No, Mum, he is a painter on an oil rig. He works 10 days on, 10 days off.” ",candidate00004
7,00002,candidate00004,"We moved house on Christmas Eve 1983 from suburban Melbourne to a small town in the Wimmera. The story starts two days later, or more precise still, on Boxing Day in the middle of the night. “Dad. Dad,” my daughter whispered, shaking me by the shoulder. “What?” “There’s a man outside my window. He talks funny.” My bedside clock showed 2.15. We had been asleep a couple of hours after unpacking all day. “I can hear him shouting from here,” I said. “What’s he doing? Come on dad!” my curious daughter urged. We felt our way along the hallway in the dark, tripping over half unpacked suitcases. “Turn the light on,” my daughter urged. “No!” We sneaked into the front room and listened to this shadowy figure that had moved on a little and now stood on the footpath right at our front door talking loudly. Then he shouted loud commands, turned and stood still. “He’s talking to the power pole,” my daughter said. “What are you two doing? Do you know what time it is?” my wife wanted to know. The dog, woken by the goings on, voiced his concern in a soft growl. “Shush, Banjo.” “Now he is talking to the wall,” I said, for the man had turned around and looked at us. “Can he see us?” “No.” Banjo went back to his basket while we three stood there in our pajamas. “Who is he?” “No idea,” I replied. “Come on sweetie,” my wife said. “Dad will keep watch, won’t you?” “Yes, Good night.” There were no streetlights, only dim light from the telephone booth across the road. Two fluorescent tubes, one on and one flickering under the Four Square Country Mart awning backlit the figure of a tall, stooped man. He wore what looked like an army great coat. He walked across the road and stood still at the supermarket door. He saluted the sandwich board leaning against the glass shop front. He seemd to be having a conversation. Trouble was, I could only see one person, but heard two voices. One spoke with authority, loudly, distinctly and fluently. The other spoke softly and more slowly, indistinctly and diffidently. Then, at the top of his lungs, he commanded a turn, did so and marched on the spot: “LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LE-HEFT….” “HALT!”The coat sleeves were much too short for his skinny arms, now at his side. “AT EASE!” Then he gave someone a real dressing down. Banjo started barking as did the bitser next door and farm dogs up in the hills. A window in the flat above the shop opened. “Go home John,” a voice called out. ” For God’s sake.” John stumbled across the road, looking neither right nor left and walked past our house. He stopped at our door again and started talking just as the clouds parted and moonlight broke through. His lips moved but he didn’t speak. His head nodded up and down and from side to side. He had something to say but the severe stammer, mumblings and incoherent mutterings told me nothing that made sense. “LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LE-HEFT….” he shouted and marched. His voice faded but not before he had set off more dogs barking. I went back to bed. He must have retired too for everything went quiet. It was the day after Boxing Day and the shop was open. I knew straight away that this was John. There was the army coat draped over a chair next to him. He was sitting at a kitchen table just inside the shop drinking coffee, a regular thing as I learnt. I introduced myself to the woman behind the counter. She had Rhonda embroidered on her apron. She came from behind the counter and asked John: “Do you want to do your shopping today?” He thought very hard and took forever to make up his mind. ”Ye..ye..ye.. yes.” “Show me the list, please.” Rhonda, obviously used to his fumbling and muttering waited patiently. “Is it in the sweatband?” John smiled and reached for the hat beside him on the tiled floor. “F…fff…fff… found it.” He looked very pleased and started talking to himself. “Did Big John keep you awake last night?” Rhonda asked as I paid for my milk. “For a little while,” I admitted. “Does he do this a lot, this late night raving?” “Not as often now. Two, three times a week. He is not drunk, only a bit unhinged. Just tell him to go home. I do.” Unhinged. Rhonda’s polite assessment got me wondering. Big John still sat there, having an argument with someone inside him. He seemed to be well known and tolerated for many coming into the shop greeted him, but no-one made an effort to speak to him, other than ‘Hello, how are you?’ to which his reply was invariably: “G….g….g…g… good, thanks.” Over coming months, I realized that if you engaged him in conversation, you had to get used to him looking past you with eyes staring at something over your right shoulder. He was Big John but not really big any more-just tall. Why Big John? I never found out. He was well over six foot tall even allowing for the pronounced stoop. Age? Seventies, maybe 80? He was bone, skin and sinew. His arms were thin sticks, his hands huge with bony knuckles, dark with darker age spots, some grayish and flaking. He wore hob nail boots without laces. He picked up his battered squatter hat. It was brown, green, grey perhaps-definitely a sunbleached hat colour. A small crown with a triangular tear, a brim not too wide. There was a greasy stain in the front where fingers over the years had picked it up and adjusted the angle. A hat some might put on a scarecrow or keep on a nail in the shed for no reason at all. He stood up, swayed a little and lurched towards the exit. His navy twill pants were a hand width too short and his bony ankles showed. He didn't bother with socks. He stood in the door way and started talking to the doorframe. “See you John,” Rhonda called out, “Be home by three for your groceries.” That interrupted his monologue and he shuffled off, head well forward, terribly unsteady. His boots made his shuffling gait, a staggering wobbly walk, a noisy affair. You could hear him scraping on the paved footpath from quite a distance-especially at night. His house was seven houses down from ours. The front garden needed weeding and the wire gate was half open and jammed permanently because of the broken top hinge. The verandah looked decidedly rickety, with gaps in the decking. The weatherboards looked patchy where some helper had failed to match the original colour. It might have been the geraniums or the magnificent magnolia tree in flower that gave this otherwise neglected and worn place a happy and welcoming look. John got by with a little bit of help. A district nurse came by three times a week. Meals on wheels delivered. John lived there on his now. His parents had lived there and he settled down with his widowed mother two years after the war ended, over as far as he was concerned already in 1943. He did not know what happened to him from the artillery battle in 1943 until 1947 when he came home. So John told Mick and Mick told me. John liked Mick and trusted him with money. Come pension day, Mick, who was the Postmaster and Commonwealth Bank agent, put a set amount into John’s special savings account. When there was enough in the kitty, John and Mick would go and see a travel agent. When he really wanted to, John was quite capable and decidedly independent. He stood in the main street, walking on the spot and looked this way and that. He wore a suit and tie and had a new walking stick. There was a worn leather suitcase close by his side. “You going somewhere John?” “Ja….Ja…. Ja… Ja Japan.” “Japan. Wow!“ He had the wickedest look about him and his eyes sparkled. “You’re up to no good,” I declared. His face broke into an even broader smile and I swear, he blushed and sniggered! “Gonna see me girlfriend,” he said. “In Os…Os…Os … Osaka.” “You dirty dog,“ I said and that made him laugh. ”Gonna have a ma… ma… .ma… ma… . massage!” “Ashiatsu?” I guessed and he nodded. “She walks all over your back?” “Yes. I like that.” Mick drove him to the airport. I wondered what the Japanese would make of this giant, thin geriatric with the warmest grin, wide mouth and big square teeth. Mick came by our house later and we talked about John. Had he done the right thing letting him go to Japan on his own? He had been there before. John’s next trip would be a four week Mediterranean cruise. The doctor insisted: John needed a companion and Mick obliged. Why the Mediterranean? Mick told me: John had served in North Africa as a gunner in World War II. His artillery crew had taken a direct hit from the enemy position after four days of exchange fire. Only John survived, slightly wounded in body. The barrage and deaths had sent him over the edge. The doctors diagnosed battle fatigue and declared him medically unfit. After three years in mental hospitals, the doctors could do no more for this traumatized man. In their opinion, John would dwell most of the time in his inner world. Not a dangerous schizophrenic but a man who able to function adequately in the outer world. He would suffer flashbacks for as long as he lived. He would be unpredictable but not a danger to himself or others. Unhinged. Mick explained that the Big John we knew, was the same man who, discharged from hospital, had come to live with his widowed mother. John had made good his promise to her, to come home. Perhaps that promise had brought him out of a catatonic state? Yes, he was home in body. His troubled mind was elsewhere. The villagers understood and made allowances. I don’t know whether we got used to John’s midnight excursions or whether he stayed home nights. Dog sometimes let out a soft “woof”. “Good boy Banjo. It’s only John. Go back to sleep.” To which he replied “humph” as if to say, ‘fine with me’. He was that sort of dog. The tourist pair came back early by air from Rome. John had fallen ill half way through the cruise. I used to see him at the Post Office quite regularly, but not lately. I asked Mick what John was up to. He had fallen at home. The broken hip mended ever so slowly. A hunched figure hobbled up the road, bent over a Zimmer frame, arms at an uncomfortable and awkward angle. It was Big John-or what was left of him. It was agony watching him lift the appliance, move it forward a fraction and catch up with faltering steps. He talked to the ground, angry. He had enough sense not to cross the road alone. I helped him until he was safely in the supermarket car park. “How are you John?” Rhonda asked. “A bit s…s….s…..slow.” She held the heavy shop door open for him and got a big smile. He managed the single step up-but only just. His face was gaunt and grey. There was caked, white spittle in the corner of his mouth. He had not shaved for quite a while. Nobody had cleaned his ears of long hairs. His fingernails were too long. He started mumbling to himself as soon as he sat down. His two voices started arguing, about what was impossible to say and kept interrupting each other. Some out-of-towners looked away, embarrassed and uncertain of what was going on. The locals just shrugged their shoulders; we knew. Rhonda brought him his coffee and that interrupted the ravings. He returned to our real world but briefly. By the time he was out the door, he had sunk back into a world of stress, conflict, turmoil oblivious of his surroundings. I don’t know what happened to Big John after Anzac Day 1997. He was there without the Zimmer frame and stood at attention as close as he could to the Cenotaph, just a stone’s throw from our house. Someone had spruced him up-he looked proud and capable. He stood tall, quite straight, medals and all. He touched the cold marble and traced the name of fallen comrades. His eyes watered. His lips moved but no words came out. But then: “ATTEN SHUN.” “LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LE-HEFT….” His voice boomed stronger than ever. His commands and the bugle call started Banjo barking in the backyard. I didn’t see Big John after that. What is it they say about old soldiers?",candidate00004
8,00001,candidate00005,"So, I'm standing in this crop circle, down in Wiltshire, England, and there's a girl dangling a crystal from the end of a chain. She's very pretty, so I'm thinking I'll have to find a way of overlooking the fact she's probably also some kind of crank if I want to take advantage of the situation here. I mean, it's not every day someone as good looking stops what she's doing, looks up, and smiles at me this way: ""First time?"" she asks. She's talking about the circle, I suppose, so I tell her yes, though this isn't actually true. There was another circle, long ago, but it's complicated and pointless explaining all of this now, so instead I go: ""Wow, that's a lovely crystal!"" which isn't as obviously flirty as complimenting her on her eyes or her hair or her dress or something, is it? Anyway: ""Thanks,"" she tells me. ""But it's just a lump of quartz - you wanna try it?"" And I say: ""Erm,… no,… it's okay."" ""Don't believe in that sort of thing then?"" Her eyes are green, and her hair is long and blonde and all frizzed up, and she's so sweet and charming I can already feel myself blushing at the effect she's having on me. ""I didn't want to disturb you, that's all,"" I tell her. ""I mean, you looked so absorbed."" ""Well, I'm done now."" I look around at the circle - though strictly speaking it's not just a circle. Sure, there's a main central circle of flattened crop, and we're standing in that, but there are also four smaller out-riding circles and, altogether, they're placed like the five dots on a dice. Then there looks to be a square, making tangents to all five circles, which ought to be quite something, I suppose - I mean really difficult to draw - except the lines don't quite meet, and the corners of the square have all been botched. It all looked so much better from up on the road and that's what tempted me down. I can't say what I was expecting to feel here, I mean standing in a circle again after all these years, only that what I'm feeling now isn't it. ""So, is it real, do you think?"" I ask. She laughs. ""Nope."" ""Does your crystal tell you that?"" ""My eyes tell me that, silly. They tell me pretty much who dunnit too."" ""Oh?"" ""Be that crew from Abbotsford way. Total menace if you ask me. They're givin' all the other corn crushers a bad name this season."" ""What are you dowsing for then, if you know it's a fake?"" She gives me a twinkle. ""Answer to a question maybe - like should I be worried about this guy who's been follerin' me round this past half hour?"" ""Ah,… "" I take a step back and raise my hands. Unarmed, see? Harmless,… that's me. Okay, I've been a little careless but a guy can sometimes reach the point when he begins to feel invisible to pretty girls, so he takes it for granted he can look at them all day long and they won't see him. Okay, that's a lame excuse, I know, and I've got some apologising to do, so I say: ""Sorry,… I didn't mean to frighten you."" ""Its okay,” she replies. “Crystal says there's no harm in you."" ""Really, I am sorry. It was just that it seemed a creepy place and I felt better, being in sight of someone else. Sounds soft I know,… "" She looks at me with one suspicious eyebrow raised. ""Crystal says the truth's a little shaky on that one."" ""But you didn't consult the crystal. I thought you kind of waved it about to get an answer."" ""Sometimes I don't need to."" I'm thinking I've blown it, but then she smiles and it seems I might have got away with it, but now I'm looking at her and realising how young she is. Twenty one? Twenty two? Far too young for someone like me, fast sliding into his middle age. It's time to be making an exit then, but it seems I've aroused her curiosity now and she's not ready to let me go just yet. ""Never been in a circle that feels creepy,"" she tells me. ""Some people jump at shadows, but that's a fear inside of them. If this place spooks you, it's in your head."" There's more to this girl than her looks! There's also, dare I say, a sympathy about her? And it's this sympathy that finally tempts out my confession: ""Actually,"" I tell her. ""I have been in a circle - once before."" ""Oh?"" ""Twenty years ago. Something happened. It shook me up a bit. That's why I'm nervous about being in this one."" She reaches out and takes my arm - sort of cups the elbow in her palm and just holds it quietly. A moment ago, all I wanted to do was make out with her but now she's comforting me against a fear she can only guess at, and I'm letting her do it because I sense something in her touch. Call it an intuition, or a delusion, but I feel this girl knows something, and that she can help me. ""Haven't been in one since?"" she asks. ""Nope."" ""Weren't that many circles around back then,"" she muses. ""Easier to fall into a live one I suppose. Is that what you're looking for maybe? A live one?"" ""Is there such a thing? I thought they were all,.. well,… "" ""Fake?"" She smiles knowingly. ""I can feel you trembling. You're telling me a circle scared you so much - and then ask me if they're all fakes?"" ""But it might just have been something in my head, like you said."" ""Well, you won't ever know until you step into a live one again. But nowadays it's complicated. Sure, you're right: there are so many people faking them now it's hard to know what you're lookin' at."" She smiles. ""Unless its that Abbotsford crew who's done it of course."" We laugh, then she tells me her name is Jocynda, and she asks me if I'd like her to show me a real one, a live one, as she calls them. But I'm thinking it'll be going dark soon, and I'd rather not be wandering around a crop circle in the dark, because it was dark the last time, and I'm not ready to get that close to things just yet. ""Is it far?"" ""Won't be."" ""I don't understand."" ""It'll be near here, yes, but it hasn't happened yet. I'm expecting a fresh one any day. I know exactly where it's gonna be: Crystal tells me that - already dowsed it off a map, see?"" ""Ah,… and you can't tell me where, I suppose?"" ""Nope. Secret. If I let it slip, the corn crushers might find out and go and make a circle in its place. And that's no use to anyone, is it?"" This is beginning to sound like the fantasy of a child. Have I misjudged her? Is she just a crank after all? ""I'll just have to trust to luck then,"" I tell her. She senses my patronising tone but forgives it with a sigh. ""Even the freshest circle hereabouts is a few weeks old,"" she explains. ""The few live ones have all settled down to background ripples by now. They'll be no use to you. I'll gladly tell you where they are but, trust me, you need a fresh one, no more than a day old."" ""You've no idea when it's going happen?"" ""Soon."" ""Crystal tells you that too?"" She giggles. ""You don't believe any of this, so whatever I say's no better 'n a guess to you is it?"" She's got me there. ""What's the hurry anyway?"" she asks. ""Never said there was. I just don't want to visit one at night, that's all."" ""Scaredy cat."" She smiles. ""Why not come to the pub and meet my friends then? Crystal says you're sad and it'll cheer you up. They have rooms there. Stay the night, see what the morning brings?"" Of course, I do not want to go to the pub, and meet Jocynda's friends. What I want is to sit at a quiet table, just her and me. I want a monopoly on her warmth and her smiles. I want to pretend I'm twenty years younger, then I can savour the glorious ambiguity of this invitation. I know she's just being friendly, but a man can dream. Anyway, instead here I am, in a cramped bar-room that's hot and loud with the sound of beery faced people. Everyone seems to be laughing like loons, except for my companions, a pair of po faced young men who sense I do not want to be there, and reciprocate with an impressive sullenness. We're hunched around a small, wobbly table, shoulder to shoulder, clutching glasses of a dark and pungently yeasty ale. I have not seen Jocynda for a while and am beginning to feel I've been abandoned to the mercies of these, my indifferent companions. One of them is called Callum. He's a dark haired, lanky youth, who was quick to ascertain my position on the flying saucer and green men hypothesis, with its attendant conspiracies of a sinister government cover-up. Significantly, he's offered no attempts at more varied conversation since then, upon discovering I do not share his beliefs. The second young man calls himself Wombat. He's a blonde, baggy jumpered, dread-locked dreamer of sorts, for whom the photographs of many seasons' worth of crop formations, framed above the bar, seem a constant source of inspiration for him, at least judging by the way his eyes divide their time between these holy icons, and the rim of his glass. One of the pictures is indeed of a pseudo-religious mandala, pressed into a golden crop of wheat. I remember it from a few years back, when it was outed in the national press as a fake, made for a documentary on the abiding credulity of human beings. When I mention this, Wombat tells me the fakers are responding to unconscious energies that guide their creations - so there is no such thing as a fake formation anyway. Indeed he goes further and tells me I am a victim of decades worth of government disinformation, and that my ignorance of these matters is proof alone of that fact. There is no answer - all his bases are covered, his position is unassailable. With the exception of their conspiracy theories, which bear certain similarities, the views of these young men seem quite different, and I am wondering how they can be so politely reconciled for them to keep such company together, but then their eyes are caught by Jocynda as she returns, and their expressions say it all. It's really quite simple, of course: they are young, and horny, and hopeful! There is another young man in tow - Dervish, she calls him. He's smartly jacketed, bespectacled, and intelligent looking, and there's something more urbane about him than these two country lads. He nods to me, then buys a round. I offer Jocynda my seat and squeeze through the crowds to join him at the bar. Dervish, I discover, is a self-confessed circle faker, the leader of a group of corn crushers currently locked in a battle of one-upmanship with a fiendishly proficient crew from Warminster. He points out the picture of a fractal star from last year's season, pressed into a barely-field and claims it as his own work - then grudgingly concedes the picture of another, an intricately worked Celtic motif, as being the handiwork of the Warminster lot. ""So, what do these guys think of you, then?"" I ask, nodding to where Callum and Wombat are currently falling over themselves to entertain Jocynda. ""I mean, them being such believers?"" He shrugs and smiles, as if he thinks the question is crass. He seems to be telling me I'm an outsider here and I just don't get the vibe. ""We're all part of the same scene, man,"" he says. We return with drinks, in time to hear the lads embarking on their discourses: Callum with news of a space-ship and attendant strange beings, spotted by the White Horse at Uffington. Then Wombat gives us an intricate post-hoc analysis of the errors in the Cantor Set formation discovered in a meadow by Stonehenge, and how they're not errors at all but a cleverly coded message that clearly predicts the date of the next apocalypse. He's a bit too young to remember, I suppose, but they were saying similar things about 2012. Meanwhile, Dervish listens to it all with polite interest, hoovering up their thoughts and perhaps wondering how he can incorporate features into his creations that will reinforce these various beliefs. Then the others want to know from him what he's planning next. I swear he gives a twinkle from his suddenly rascally and theatrically revealed gold tooth, and then he says it will be big - more complex even than the Sumerian motifs of last season, that they should prepare themselves to be blown away! They stare at him agape, as if they see him as a sort of messianic instrument, and I notice he is careful to say nothing that might discourage them in these beliefs. Me? Well, I'm older aren't I? I am of an age when I see beliefs as no different to all the other useless jabberings in this bar. In another twenty years, these guys will be looking back and believing in nothing much at all, and I'm guessing, like me, the only thing they'll really remember about tonight in any detail is Jocynda - the colour of her eyes, the texture of her hair, what she was wearing, and how much she filled our hearts with such sweet longing. They're laughing now. Jocynda has told them about the Abbotsford crew's latest efforts, and they are amused by how I could ever have been taken in by it. So I remind them that by their own arguments, the fakers respond to unconscious influences of a paranormal nature - therefore how can the Abbotsford crew be any different? But the lads are united in their belief the Abbotsford crew aren't a real part of the phenomenon at all - just a bunch of cider-swigging yokels. It seems one must possess a certain level of social gravitas in order to become a true instrument of the gods. They close their ranks and look at me as if wondering what Jocynda means by dragging this grumpy old guy into their presence. It's clearly not to make them jealous - so then what? I suppose Jocynda means nothing by it all except showing kindness to a stranger. Seeing her with them though makes me wonder again what I thought I was doing, letting myself be seduced into hanging around like this. I realise of course I don't really see Jocynda when I look at her - only her beauty, and such beauty is ageless. It pays no heed to the stages of a man's life. Sure: when he's younger, he can make love to it - but when he's older? What's he supposed to do about it then? By now the beer has taken my legs, made me sweaty and dizzy, and I'm incapable of working any of this out. The noise of the bar is like a wall of madness ringing in my ears and I want to go, except now she's lowered her mouth to my ear and is saying: ""Tell us about your circle."" ""My what?"" The jabbering in the bar is so loud I do not hear my own words, so I am shouting above it, and the others look surprised because it seems they hear me very well. ""Sorry,"" I tell her. ""Getting a bit tired."" She's disappointed, but her sparkle is quickly restored by the continuing attentions of her companions who seem far more eager for her company than they do for mine. I make my excuses, then slip away to my room, quietly grizzling as I climb the stairs: I might have been lying in my own bed by now, far away from the past, from my youth, but instead, I've descended into a kind of cesspit, seething with human madness - a madness that is totally incapable of answering the question first posed to me in a simple swirled circle of wheat all those years ago: How does one judge the truth of anything? In the morning, I am on the carpark of the inn, rested, breakfasted and lifting my bags into the boot. I've decided it's best to head for home but, right on cue, an old Volkswagen bug appears, and Jocynda trails a lazy arm from its window, as she rolls up beside me. She slides her shades down a touch and says: ""You going?"" ""Yep."" ""Crystal says you're angry - that we got on your nerves last night."" ""Crystal's wrong, then. I mean,… I was angry - but not with you,… or your friends. Like you said it's something in my head. That's why I was angry, and that's why I should be going."" ""You are angry, though."" She's looking so pretty this morning, all hugged up in a sweater against the cool air. But the sky is clear and it'll make a fine day when the sun gets up - a day for lingering, for admiring the beauty of this lovely creature. But what's the use? That's not why I came here at all! ""I can't solve any of this now,"" I tell her. ""It's just too damned late for me."" ""Are you going to explain that, or shall I see what Crystal says?"" She's smiling, giving me the impression she sees more in me than I'm comfortable with. Is it so obvious I'm jealous of her boyfriends, jealous of their youth, and angry too that youth can be so blind to beauty, all it wants to do is hump its bones? ""It's just that nothing I heard last night explains anything,"" I tell her. ""Oh?” ""I came looking for a solution."" ""To what? The circles?"" ""Maybe, but it's more than that. The circles just bring it all into sharper focus, that's all. I came looking for the truth: I mean about everything!"" ""Is that all?” She gives a dry laugh. “I take it you've had no luck yet?"" ""Can it really be so difficult? The circles I mean. On the one hand I'm offered Callum and his scary little green men, while on the other I get Wombat and his mother earth going on about yet another damned apocalypse - as if we didn't have enough paranoia the last time. Then there's Dervish and his cynicism about the other two lads believing in all this paranormal stuff, while so far as I can tell his only motive's a rather shallow and egotistical desire to have the Warminster corn crushers fall down and worship at his feet."" She thinks back fondly, then chuckles. ""Yep. That just about covers it. You'd think one of them would be right, wouldn't you?"" ""But what about you? What do you think?"" ""Me? Oh,… "" she shakes her head and looks clueless. ""Wotcher asking me for, silly?"" ""You talked about ripples, about circles quietening down after a while. You dowse for energies with your crystal. I mean what's that all about?"" ""I don't dowse the circles. Crystal tells me things, that's all. Circles tingle, lots of people feel that - don't need to measure it. Energy? Whatever does that mean? All I know is a tingly circle's where it happens for me. Think its where it happened for you too. And where it might happen for you again."" ""Where what might happen?"" ""Listen, maybe you're not going to get this, but if it's the truth you're after, then you need to find a tingly circle and step into it. Then you'll know."" ""Why can't you just tell me?"" ""Because it wouldn't make any sense to you, silly."" ""Try me."" ""Okay imagine this: a place where anything you believe in can be. Anything at all! Green men come to stick things up your bum? Great Mother nagging us about yet another bloody apocalypse? Dervish's rational world where nothing ever happens that he can't calculate? All of it. All true, at the same time. See? No problem."" ""You're right. It doesn't make any sense at all."" She bites her lip - impatient with herself that she cannot explain things any better. Then she leans across and clicks open the passenger door. ""Get in. I want to show you something."" She takes me out across the downs, the old bug thrumming away and smelling of damp carpets. She does not speak, but rides quietly with the window down, her hair blowing in the draft, the crystal nestling snug in her bosom and shooting out little rainbows as the sun hits it. We pull over down a quiet lane, the trees in a nearby copse swishing in the breeze, a meadow of pale green barley moving in liquid silver waves, and there's a whole set of concentric circles, like a bullseye in its middle. The formation looks freshly minted and I'm wondering if it's the one that Crystal predicted, but she hastens to reassure me it's not - says it's a few weeks old now and fairly quiet but a live one all the same. She picks up on my hesitation and tells me not to worry, that nothing dramatic will happen here, that I can relax - merely dip my toes a little. So I follow her through the wire, pick up a tram-line, and she leads me out to the formation. As she enters, she raises her arms, with her palms flat, and gives a little twirl. ""Tingle's nearly gone now,"" she says. ""But you might feel it, if you're quiet."" There is a tingle in my palms, but that could be anything. Less easy to explain is the buzzy, crackly sound in my ears, but that could just be too many rock concerts. There's a different look to this one though: a puzzling complexity to the way the barley's swirling, first one way, and then the next. It's strange,… beautiful. ""Not the work of the Abbotsford crew then?"" She laughs, tells me I'm a fast learner, coaxes me into the centre of the circle, then asks me to hold still. Then she plants her index finger in the middle of my forehead: ""Know what's inside of there, under my finger?"" ""Brain?"" ""Which bit of brain, silly?"" ""Erm,… front bit?"" ""Okay, now go deeper. Imagine my finger poking deep inside, as far as it can go."" ""Middle bit, then?"" ""Pineal gland. Okay? Called that 'cos it's like a pine-cone? Geddit?"" ""Okay, I've heard of it."" ""Feel my finger tickle it now? Likes to be tickled. Tickle it by twiddling some magnets around your head and strange things will happen.” ""Oh?"" ""Hallucination maybe - or maybe something else. Some call it a port-way to whatever ocean floats your boat."" ""You're saying a tingly circle will induce an hallucination?"" ""I said maybe."" She lowers her finger and looks around. ""Why not? If it's magnetic - and it vibrates. Sounds right, feels right to me."" ""A magnetic anomaly? Okay! That gives the energy a name. But why would it fade? And why would it vibrate? And how does it get here. None of these are answers, Jocynda - just more questions."" She offers no explanation but looks closely at me again: ""Tell me now,"" she says. ""What happened to you?"" I'm feeling more than just a tingle in my palms at the moment and I'm not sure I want to explore this. I'm still nervous about it, I guess, because the hairs are standing on my arms, and I can feel ants crawling over the top of my head. ""I don't know what happened, but it didn't feel like an hallucination."" ""Grrrr. Can't you just tell me?"" ""Okay, a bunch of us dared each other to sleep out in a circle, near Avebury, one summer. I was a pretty rational kind of guy in those days, and I didn't think anything about it, but I woke up in the small hours to find the others had gone, and there was this big cardboard box in the middle of the circle with my name on it - not scribbled mind - it was printed into the cardboard, all official-like. So, I figured the others were having me on, except I couldn't work out why they'd left me, or why they'd gone to the expense of making up a personalised box. ""It seemed too elaborate, nonsensical, like things are in dreams, but at the same time it felt so real. I shouted for them, thinking they were hiding out in the field, but after a while I knew I was alone. Then a voice came from inside my head, a woman's voice - clear, gentle - not frightening or anything - and she told me that if I looked inside that box I'd find the answer to everything I'd ever wanted to know - that I would find the truth, you see?"" ""Cool. So, what did you do?"" ""Do? What do you think I did? I ran. I went back to the van, but the others weren't there. They turned up in the morning, said they'd slept the whole night through, in the circle, like we'd agreed, and woke up to find me gone."" She flops down in the barley, and I flop down with her. The crop's beginning to lift itself back up to the sun and the little brush-like stalks tickle us as we lay there. ""You wish you'd looked inside that box, don't you?"" ""Knowing for sure I'd really seen that box would be a start."" She gives me a sympathetic look, and then floors me with the most peculiar question: ""Do you believe in unicorns?"" ""Erm,… you want the honest answer?"" ""Okay,… fair do's. But I've believed in them since I was a little girl - or maybe wanted to believe, is a better way of putting it."" ""Go on."" ""Saw one in a crop circle,"" she tells me. ""That makes my cardboard box seem dull. Do you see them often?"" ""Don't look at me like that! Just tell yourself it's an hallucination and you'll be okay with it. Anyway, there I am, in the middle of the day - other people all around me and I'm wondering why they can't see him too."" ""What's he like, your unicorn?"" ""Oh, he's such a beauty. Soft to touch, coat like silk. He's very shy, but he lets me pet him. Been seeing him for years now - in places like this. I haven't ridden him yet, but I'm working up to that. Now, I know what you're thinking, and I've thought the same thing, but what if he really is a unicorn?"" ""The way you describe him, I wish he was real. But there's got to be a difference between what the mind invents, and what's true. Where would we be otherwise? There'd be no consistency to the world."" ""Have you never thought that maybe we don't need consistency? Maybe we only think we do. Maybe in a pure state of being, consistency is something we only play with now and then, and what's really true is something so far beyond our understanding we can never hope to touch it while we're livin' in these skins. The truth we crave is just the petty stuff, the stuff we let ourselves believe in. We narrow our beliefs to something small, and that's the measure of our world, our truth. Ask me, I think your box was empty. That's what your voice was trying to tell you."" ""Lucky I didn't open it then, or I'd've been really cross."" ""Ha ha."" ""Listen, you're starting to sound like Callum and Wombat now. Take some advice? If you really want Dervish to like you, you must play down this side of yourself. I mean, this unicorn thing is really cute, but,… well,… I don't see him going for it."" She's amused. ""What makes you think I want Dervish to like me that way?"" ""Just guessing. I don't have Crystal to help me out all the time."" ""Well, I'm not that fussed about Dervish really. But out of interest, if you were me, who would you choose?"" ""Among those three reprobates? Well, Dervish is the better looking, but he's a bit of a rake, and he only wants one thing from you."" ""Crystal agrees."" she says. ""And Callum?"" ""Callum doesn't trust anyone - he thinks the whole world's in conspiracy against his version of the truth, so one day he's going to wind up wondering what it is you're hiding as well, and it won't matter how you play it, he'll always have an answer for why his creepy version of reality's more valid than your sunny one, where unicorns gallop across the Wiltshire downs. As for Wombat - well, he's a sweet guy but he doesn't look the kind to hold down a regular nine-to-five for the rest of his life, which is what you need a damned sight more than woolly words when you've got kids to bring up."" ""Sounds like none of them will do then. Perhaps you're thinking I should pick you instead?"" She pouts wonderfully, but she's only playing with me. ""Well, I've been smitten since I first saw you, Jocynda, but I don't think that's what this is about, do you?"" She sighs. ""Crystal agrees."" ""It does?"" For a moment I'm gutted, until I remember it's only what the crystal says, and I don't believe in it - except it must be what Jocynda thinks or she wouldn't believe in it either. ""Crystal's not so dumb then,"" I tell her. She takes my hand. Okay - she knows I'm not going to get the wrong idea now, but she needn't test me so. ”What is it about, then?"" she asks. ""For me? What it's always been: seeking that box with the truth in it, but always getting waylaid by beauty."" I'm looking right at her as I tell her this and manage to leave her in no doubt about the kind of beauty I'm meaning. She blushes and shakes her head. ""You're very kind, but one day I'll be old and all of this will have gone. Beauty is so fleeting. And the truth? Well, like I said, that's whatever you choose to make it. Both are human values, and chasing either's gonna,… well,… "" she chuckles. ""Have you runnin' round in circles."" I've stretched out on my back and cupped my hands behind my head. The barley's soft and springy underneath and I'm feeling pretty good, just being with her. Meanwhile she's moved around a little and she's laying down on her back too, resting her head upon my belly like it's a pillow, the two of us making a big T in the middle of the circle. Then something pops into my head and I'm saying: ""This isn't an old circle at all is it?"" ""Nope. Came down last night, right where crystal said it would. Feels like a real live one to me. Relax. No saying what might happen.” I stiffen at once. ""You could have warned me!"" ""Shush now, relaaaax! Just to fall into it – real gentle like."" ""Okay,… but I hope it's not little green men. Ughh. Nasty things."" She laughs. ""How could it be? You don't believe in them."" ""I know, but listening to Callum can be scary - and fear is infectious, isn't it? What if he's contaminated me with his own beliefs. I mean, what if he's right?"" ""He is right. Remember? Leastwise in his own head he is. Just like the rest of us."" She chuckles. ""Now, don't you go worrying about any little green bogey men. I'll just shoo them away with my unicorn, while you go lookin' for your box."" I can hear that buzzing sound again, and while I'm feeling kind of dizzy, I'm also feeling sleepy and comfortable. Meanwhile, Jocynda's found my hand once more and she's holding onto it, because I think she feels it too. So,… I'm now about three hours Northbound, and the M5 is about to join the M6, so the traffic's starting to get a bit sticky, like it always does around here. It's late evening, the sun going down and there are little rainbows shooting out of the crystal that's dangling from my rear view mirror. Jocynda told me it was just a lump of quartz and not to make such a fuss when she gave it to me. I needn't believe in it, she said, that it was really just something to remember her by. Then she kissed me, sort of shy, and then she waved me off. I found my cardboard box, right where I'd left it twenty years ago, and it was empty, just like Jocynda guessed it would be. Now, maybe it was only empty because she put the thought into my head, but it's not the first time I've wondered about it. After all, what can you put inside a box that's vague enough to be read as a metaphor describing the truth of all things, in any language, yet still make any kind of any sense to you? Let's just say it came as no surprise, even though I've spent the best years of my life hoping there might have been something more, I don't know,.. tangible, I suppose. What am I supposed to make of it then? Well, maybe Dervish and his hoaxers had somehow worked their way inside my head, given my pineal thingy a playful kick, and were having a darned good laugh at my expense, but I looked up from my empty box to find Jocynda, dressed in white, like a picture book fairy, sitting proudly on the back of her unicorn and I was left wondering if she might actually be right about a lot of other stuff as well. Suddenly the quest for truth, in human terms at least, seems overrated to me now. Ask anyone what those circles down in Wiltshire are about or how they got there, and you'll get a different answer every time. It's really no more than whatever you choose to believe it is. And if that's so, I'd rather have Jocynda's sunny wishful thinking than some of the other creepy stuff I've heard. Anyway, going back to Jocynda sitting on that unicorn, she gave me a twinkle, then she and that magnificent beast just took off over the downs in a scene as lovely as anything I'm ever going to bear witness to again. And, unlikely as it might have appeared to common sense, I could not deny the heart-wrenching beauty of it. Okay: red tail lights are stabbing up ahead now as the motorway slows down, so I close in behind the car in front and give the crystal a tap, then watch it swing. Sure, Jocynda will grow old like me and some of what she has will fade. But real beauty's not like she said: it's only when we try to pin it down it becomes ephemeral. Think of it more as a feeling though, like how the sight of Jocynda on that fantastic beast lifted my heart to the heavens, then beauty becomes something altogether different. Such a thing can transport you to the edge of infinity, to a place no amount of petty truth is ever going to describe. Oh, I know: I told her I was searching for the truth, like a shining knight of old, but always getting waylaid by beauty. Well, if you ask me now, I've always had it the wrong way round. So, go seek the eternal beauty of the soul, my friend, and don't go getting yourself waylaid by promises of truth, no matter how alluring, because it's always going to be an illusion, or just somebody else's nightmare, or at the very best a closed down vision of a world that could be whole lot bigger, if we could only open our eyes a little wider.The traffic's really bad now! I could do with some directions on how to get around it. Sat Nav? What kind of truth will that give me? A narrowly plotted path from one place to the next? Sounds dull! I reckon from now on, I'll just go,… … .by whatever Crystal says. ",candidate00005
9,00002,candidate00005,"Carla Sinclair was born, so to speak, in January 1982 when, after long hours of coding in the quiet of my bedroom, I succeeded in printing her out on silvered thermal paper from my Sinclair ZX81. The routine just about filled the 1 KByte of memory I had at my disposal and I have to say it was a triumph of efficient programming for its day, an interlocking Chinese puzzle of nested loops and iterative algorithms. Of course, Carla didn't do anything. For all the effort I'd put in, she was just a picture, like a pencil drawing, except not nearly so precise. Indeed her pixels were rather blocky, on account of there being no real graphics capability on those early machines. The whole thing was something of a trick, an illusion achieved by printing out special text characters, line by line. But for all her shortcomings I could call her up at any time, having preserved her for all eternity on a Philips C60 cassette and though it sounds unbelievably antiquated nowadays, such a thing was quite special back then. She was an idea, if you like, the image of a woman - frozen, mysterious and somehow, to a young man on the cusp of manhood, she was curiously portentous - a phenomenon only barely grasped by the quaint technology of the day, like viewing a figure vaguely through hammered glass. Along with the ZX 81, Sinclair also brought out a 16 Kilobyte memory expansion. Now, relative to my income in those days, this little module cost quite a bit, and it meant saving up for a while, but the lure of all that memory eventually sent me anxiously in search of the nearest WH Smiths who were flogging them by the bucket load. What this gained me was the capacity to store a series of static poses of Carla, sixteen in all, each painstakingly defined as points on a 2D plane, their x-y co-ordinates copied from images I'd first traced onto graph paper and then reproduced as strings in the code. What it meant was that by playing the images one after the other I could actually make Carla move. It took a long time to crack that early program, to squeeze it into memory and get rid of the bugs, but eventually I had her walking from one side of my old portable TV screen to the other. Her movements were jerky, like a vintage flick-card routine. But this was state of the art back then, when Carla and I were young. Then the Sinclair Spectrum came out and it seemed to me as if technology were running away. The possibilities were endless and I simply had to have one. I sold my old push bike and a record player, saved up for several months and brought one home for Christmas 1983. I remember the feeling when I set it up in my bedroom, a mixture of excitement and reverence at the thought of the 48 Kilobytes of memory I now had to play with. The Spectrum gave Carla a more clearly delineated form with finer pixels and a proper two dimensional graphics. She also gained real freedom of movement, and I could control her a little better. I incorporated a scaling routine which meant I could have her turn her back on me and march off into an imaginary distance. With a good deal of tweaking and playing around with the timings I managed to get her movements to the stage where they were as fluid and convincing as any professionally drawn cartoon. Those of you reading this who remember those early Sinclair machines may also remember that the version of the BASIC programming language on the Spectrum was a little more advanced than on the ZX 81. Things were changing in the world of coding, and new directions were opening up. For-Next routines were already beginning to look a bit clumsy and I discovered ways you could compile the code into Assembly Language in order to make it run much faster. All in all there were more sophisticated ways of doing things and I spent a lot of time grappling with the implications of these changes, a thing that stood me in good stead for when, in 1985, Sinclair brought out the groundbreaking 128 Kilobyte QL, with a clock speed that now stood at an impressive 7.5 MHz. When the publicity leaflet dropped through the letterbox, I knew I had to have one. I printed out my Carla code on thermal paper and stored it safely, sold the Spectrum, the ZX81, and a raft of games, then cleared a space in my bedroom for the sexy black jewel of a machine the QL was back then. I realised of course I could now make Carla do just about anything: stand, sit, smile, wave,… it was purely a question of detail and having the patience to code it all up. The QL had opened all sorts of horizons and this brought about a turning point in Carla's evolution. To be blunt, I was a young man with a liking for the female form. So far, Carla had been modestly clothed but now I had the technology and the memory capacity to make her strip and parade naked,… indeed do all manner of things that in fantasy I had dreamed of seeing girls do. I admit to making a start along those lines by incorporating a routine that would cause her to wink and shimmy in a saucy fashion. Also I added a certain autonomy to her movements with the RND function, so I no longer had to walk her about myself with the arrow keys. But by now the code was getting up for a thousand lines long, and it was not nearly so easy to debug. For some inexplicable reason it kept branching to that wink routine, so Carla appeared to develop a nervous tick. I took this as an omen and decided not to pursue things any further in that direction. Carla was obviously not that sort of girl. Besides, by now I'd taken to leaving her running day and night and I didn't want my mother to come into my bedroom with the vacuum cleaner and find her doing something naughty. But there was more to it than that. Carla, for me, went beyond a certain natural prurience, into realms of psychology I did not then fully understand. Instead, I chose another direction and coded some background details so she had a little room with a table, a chair and a bed to sleep in. Then I incorporated a timer function so she ran in harmony with GMT and knew when it was the proper time to sleep. This was the point where she took on a fledgling life of her own and though it might sound strange to you, perhaps even a little sad, I liked to come home from the office to see what she was up to: looking out of the window, reading a book, combing her hair in the mirror, eating a sandwich,… mundane actions and fairly pointless you might say except Carla was something that had come out of me. And this alone gave her meaning. To me! Once, I woke up in the small hours to find her sitting on her bed instead of sleeping in it. This was immediately troubling and I stayed up until dawn trying to understand what was wrong. In the end it proved to be a simple bug, easy to fix but a devil to find. I mention this incident only to illustrate just how important Carla had become. It seemed I could have no peace unless everything was also running smoothly with her. All right. I was not completely unhinged. She was just a computer program, a crude simulation - at best a never ending animated cartoon with only one character and no story line. But she was ""something"",… a hobby I suppose you might say. Other young men had hobbies, equally obscure, though perhaps more socially inclusive. They collected camera gear, they went fishing, raced cars or drank themselves stupid. Me? I coded in my bedroom. Same thing? Well, not quite. You see, while other people's hobbies took them out of themselves, mine enabled me to climb deeper inside. But by now I was reaching the limit of what was possible, even with the QL. I had tried adding a little colour to Carla's life, painting her walls, adding a change of colour to her clothes, but it began to take its toll on frame rate and no matter how much I massaged the code I realised I was up against the laws of physics. It was down to the computer's clock speed, and the QL simply wasn't fast enough any more. Meanwhile, at the office, something strange was happening. It was around 1989 by now and typewriters were disappearing. Secretaries were being given IBM computers, the so called PS2, based on the new Intel 80286 chip. This was an altogether different beast to the QL, a blank slate if you like. PC's had been around since 1981 but they'd always seemed terribly clunky things to me - big, expensive and up till then not a patch on the QL in terms of clock speed and RAM. But the PS2 was different: it was a foretaste of things to come. The PS2 had a huge re-writable disk for storage and a memory capacity of around a megabyte, which beggared belief. You could basically make this machine do anything you wanted, and it was no end of frustration for me having to watch while secretaries hacked out bits of memos on it when I could have been using it to take Carla and her world to new heights of reality. But of course buying an IBM back then was unthinkable: they cost as much as a second hand car. Plus, around about that time I got married and my wife didn't like Carla running all day,… I mean not even in the spare room. She had this thing about leaving appliances plugged in overnight. What if it caused a fire? It made no difference that Carla had been running more or less non stop now for five years without so much as a warm plug. Carla, it seemed, had reached the end of the road,… and the plug was pulled. I was in my late twenties by now and realising that pretty much everything you want to do in life involves some sort of compromise. To be fair, I was having a ball with my wife, and Carla simply wasn't that important any more. In what bits of spare time I had, I modified the QL to take a floppy drive and Carla lived on that in discrete isolation for weeks on end. I also modified the code to include a save-state routine which meant she could pick up from wherever I'd last switched her off. But it wasn't the same, not being able to just casually glance at the screen whenever I felt like it in order to see what she was doing. Slowly then, Carla slipped into the background of my life. I remember running her for an hour or so one evening until she went to bed. At that point I saved her state and shut her down. It was 9 PM July the 10th 1992. Then I went into the bathroom and found my wife holding a little plastic thing that told us she was pregnant. Life became rather blurry after that. One child followed the other, the house became too small, so we moved, renovated, moved and renovated again. What with all the fuss, it was August the 4th 1997 before I rediscovered the QL lurking in an unopened packing box in the attic. By this time the QL had become something of a curiosity in computer circles. I brought it down into the spare room and switched it on. With a struggle I remembered the instructions in order to access the floppy and I loaded Carla into memory. She threw back the sheets, walked to the mirror in her night-dress, yawned, stretched and combed out her hair - all as if nothing had happened. But she'd lost 5 years! I'd forgotten what she looked like, how well she moved. I don't know why this touched me, but it did and that's when my eldest daughter came into the spare room to find her daddy crying. Clearly I had underestimated what I was dealing with. I'd known lads at college who'd spent night after night coding a sort of quasi 3D shoot-em-up game to run on their Commodore VICs. Then they'd moved on to flight simulators, and rally games, but always the challenge for them was the code, trying to find ways of doing more with less, fighting against the limitations of memory and clock speed. For me though, code was always secondary. The creation, Carla, was of primary importance, important enough to make a grown man cry at the thought of all those wasted years. If I'd only kept it up, what might Carla be capable of now? At that time, I was living in a four bed detached executive brick-box, and I drove a brand new Rover 216. I worked in a shipping office, which largely involved tapping figures into a spreadsheet. Things had moved on apace since those first Intel processors, and now most of us in the office, even middle rankers like me had an early Pentium on his desk. I asked my wife if I could buy one, but she couldn't see the point, even though we could easily have afforded it by then. ""What would you do with it?"" she asked. And I was at a loss to answer because I knew she would not understand. To her Carla was just some quirky cartoon her husband had knocked up in his spare time. He'd snapped his fingers in some geeky, technical way that didn't really interest her, and I'm sure she thought me a little sad, a little childish perhaps. Carla made the children giggle but beyond that there was no practical purpose to her being. Curiously, my wife's lack of understanding was instrumental in making me sit down and seriously try to understand it myself. But my conclusions at that time fell short of discovering the real truth. Carla was a part of me, a part that went back to my boyhood - that's all I knew - and in some fuzzy headed way, I suspected she still had a part to play. We had grown up together, she and I, and in exploring her there had always been a sense that in some way I had also been exploring a part of myself. Married life in middle age had for me become less about being with someone, and more about my perceived responsibilities - towards the children, towards not letting my wider circle of family down, of maintaining the house in good repair, and inevitably it was about keeping up with appearances, such as mowing the lawn regularly and making sure the car was always as shiny as the neighbours'. It's a maddeningly false business of course - the cliché of suburban life. Consequently a man needs a hobby in his middle years, perhaps more than at any other time - fishing rods, golf clubs,… something, anything to take him out of himself and remind him of who he is, who he was, but above all to give him a glimmer of hope that all is not lost, that he might still become the person he always thought he would one day be. In short a man needs to construct a fantasy of his reality, or his reality of fantasy will slowly crush him. I brought home a Pentium 2 in the Autumn of 1998. This caused some marital friction, but I weathered it. I bought books on C++ and began the long haul of bringing Carla up to date, for I had come to the conclusion that BASIC had run to the end of what I wanted to achieve with it. I needed something faster, something that worked more closely with the guts of the machine itself, something that could more easily tickle the noughts and the ones into life, make the machine sing and dance, make it fly! I studied games like Quake and Doom. These were fast, blast-em-up first person shooters, and I boggled at their scale. Here were entire three dimensional worlds coded into a silicon memory, realistic and immersive, while poor Carla existed as a lone two dimensional sprite, in a primitively drawn room. So it began: late nights; spare-bedroom coding, while my wife turned in early, and didn't seem to notice my creeping to bed in the small hours, bleary eyed and yet too stimulated to sleep. Things had moved on a lot since those days of two dimensional sprites and, similarly, bedroom coders had moved on from Pacman and Hungry Horace into writing three dimensional engines for games that seemed fantastic to me at first. Eventually though, these games all began to look the same: guns and power-ups, improbable aliens and ever more realistic gore. Of course, the people writing these games were probably only half my age and for all their obvious intelligence, they began to seem like little more than children. They were weaving miracles out of the code and using it to make a child's game. Carla wasn't like that though. She had never been a game, but then not quite a simulation either. Indeed I had yet to define exactly what she was. Over those first months of labour on the P2, she became a three dimensional animation, her room a proper 3D model. And beyond the window she gazed out of every morning I modelled a 3D landscape with hills and trees that grew and shed their leaves according to the season. In the code I began including behavioural routines based on body states. How long had she been awake? Was she tired? Was she hungry? Did she need to use the toilet? And I let her body states determine her behaviour patterns, instead of it being a purely random function - if she was tired, she sat down. If she was hungry, she ate. The P2 had a 3D accelerator card and 128 megabytes of memory. No longer was Carla a monochrome cartoon but full colour and eerily realistic. There were lights in her room that she could switch on and off for mood and effect. I programmed her to prefer a softer atmosphere and in the evening, when her darkness fell, she would sit in the intimate glow of lamplight holding a book, as if she were reading. When she was happy, she would flick her hair and twitch her toe as if to music. I had programmed all of these reponses.I knew she was not alive, but it still made me feel good when she appeared to be happy. By now she moved like a real person, sat down like a real person and I had even added a routine so that her chest rose and fell as if she were breathing. Her eyes blinked, her lips moved,… and incredibly, for all this coding, I had not yet exceeded even one tenth of the machine's capacity. The technology was no longer a limiting factor in what might be achieved. Now the limitation was my own ingenuity, and having a clear idea of where I wanted to go. The next stage was more dangerous for me and revived memories of my first attempts at turning Carla into some sort of digital tart. My aim seemed to be in achieving as much autonomy and realism as possible and there was something missing in this regard that could only be captured by the addition of her occasional nudity, plus granting her the freedom to dress as she chose. This was not voyeurism, but a necessary stage to be gone through. Over the years of my marriage I had grown used to casually encountering the occasional domestic nudity of my wife, and so it seemed a similar stage was appropriate for me and Carla, a coming of age so to speak - a sort of marriage in which I could observe her form without embarrassment. Modelling the mesh of her unclothed body gave me pleasure, but not in a prurient sense. And even painting the highly detailed texture of her skin and her intimate areas filled me with something more akin to reverence than simple arousal. I modelled her underwear and a basic wardrobe in a variety of colours and simulated fabrics for her to choose from. The whole thing worked like a dream! Now Carla rose in the morning, showered, dressed, then entered her living quarters and made ready to start the day. It was a triumph, and so wonderful a thing to watch, I always made sure I was up early enough to witness it. But where was all of this going? I'd hit my middle forties by now and the sum total of my life seemed to be a family who were growing ever more distant, a job I couldn't wait to retire from and an obsession with a computer animated woman whose well being I cared for enough to stay up all night nursing the bug ridden code out of her system. But she was not alive. She was not even a she. I could have changed her sprite into one depicting a giant chicken and the program would have worked just the same. I was not losing my mind. I understood all of these things, but still I could not rest unless everything was well with Carla. Of course, it was her feminine line that gave her meaning. An artist who paints nudes all his life is seeking something more through the female form than is visible to a less sensitive eye that sees only the naughty bits. Similarly for me, it was something inside - something about her form that haunted me. Carla had become a means of self expression, self exploration: Carla was art. Only when I read the works of Carl Jung, the Zurich psychologist, was the mystery partially solved. Inside the unconscious mind of every man, you see, there is an archetype that's female in nature - an archetype being a focus for a particular blend of psychic energy within the unconscious. And if a man is genuine in wanting to understand himself, he can only do it if he engages with the feminine side of his own nature. Then the woman inside of him can speak through dreams, through fantasy, and instruct him, guide him through the deeper parts of himself. Some men have a lot of difficulty with this sort of thing and believe it involves going around dressing up in women's clothes, or behaving in an effeminate or overly emotional way. It can come to that if the woman within gets out of hand and the man ends up possessed by her,… but if he can avoid that fate, if he is curious about where the woman might lead him, then he can embark upon an inner journey, an obsession with what is nothing short of the mystery of the universe itself. It is the age old quest, the meaning of life, the Philosopher's Stone. Suddenly, it all became clear. My work with Carla was nothing less than alchemy. Carla was the reflection of an unconscious archetype that over the years had taken on an ever more realistic representation. But how much further could I logically pursue this? I was still in full control of her. Her choice of clothes, her actions, her moods - all was down to me through the lines I'd coded. Any apparent autonomy was little more than an illusion afforded by the ever convenient RND function of the computer - the random number algorithm. Coding is a natural extension of logical thought. It is the embodiment of determinism. For all its arcane language, it is like Newtonian clockwork, and the random numbers of the RND function are not really random at all. They are the output of an algorithm, like COS and SIN - same seed, same random sequence,… every time. Real randomness is quite different. For a start it is impossible to code. And there is something else about real randomness, something disturbing if you look at it closely enough. Over the years I had become interested in the statistical properties of randomness and also the apparent ease with which it manifests itself in nature. As humans we convince ourselves that the world looks a certain way. Every effect has a defining cause and therefrom spring all the laws of physics and mathematics that we rely upon to make sense of things. Yet something that is truly random, such as the decay of a radioactive substance, or even the time series produced by something so mundane as the dripping of a tap is an effect without any clearly definable cause. So the closer you look at life, the less solid appear the foundations upon which everything is built. Randomness is impossible to code, yet it exists everywhere in nature. You can toss a coin and that's as near random as its possible for a human to achieve, but it's hard to do this fast enough in order to provide a stream of random digits that will keep up with a processor running at 350 Megacycles. You can buy an RNG of course, a random number generator - a little black box that you plug into the parallel port of your computer. This device works on the decay of a radioactive material, the particles it releases being detected by an electronic apparatus and the timings converted into random numbers - real random numbers. These things aren't cheap but if you put off changing the car for a year they're not beyond the pocket of the ordinary chap - not so easy to explain to one's wife though, just what it is you've spent your money on. But what can I say? An RNG was something I simply had to have! It took just a couple of minutes to modify the code so Carla called upon the RNG, instead of on the RND algorithm. Then, I set her running and watched her for a while. There was no real difference of course, at least none that I could see. Carla rose about the same time, showered, put on a pink top and the new jeans I'd recently modelled for her. Then she sat down to read. Of course, there was no visible difference at all - except I knew I had now broken the link between Carla and the machine. Her movements and her behaviour might have been structured by the code, but those actions were now invoked by a stream of digits coming from the mysterious abyss at the quantum level of reality. This was important. It was the point at which she and I began to merge more closely into one, the point at which I began a serious dialogue with my unconscious mind, and with the universe from whence I had come. There are those who argue, plausibly, that human consciousness has its origins in the quantum level of reality. Therefore, in this sense, Carla and I now had something in common. What underpinned her actions in her world was the same as what underpinned me, in mine. My own every day reality was reaching a sort of climax, but one that had nothing to do with Quantum Physics. I was fifty one and my kids had gone off to university. The house seemed empty without them and it had been on my mind to talk to my wife about the possibility of moving down to a smaller place, perhaps release some capital so I could think more seriously about retiring early. Then I came home from the office one evening to discover she'd already found a smaller place, but didn't intend for us to share it on account of her already having someone else in mind. It took a while to iron out all the details, but I eventually found myself separated and alone, living in a little terraced house on the outskirts of town. The place was a bit of a wreck but I managed to buy it outright and, compared to the other house, it cost virtually nothing to run. A little paint and paper and it was as good as new. There was nowhere to park the car on account of the main road that ran outside, but then I was only a short walk from the bus station anyway, so I sold the car, then walked into PC World and bought the best computer I could find with the proceeds. It had several gigabytes of memory and a clock speed in the region of four gigacycles, and the chip ran so hot it needed a refrigeration system to keep it from breaking down. It was an extravagance I suppose since even after twenty five years of development Carla was a long way yet from outgrowing my antiquated P2. But as I have already explained, a man needs something in his life, a focus for his attention and I did not trouble myself over the expense. Then the office looked set to merge with a bigger outfit from Manchester and everyone over the age of fifty got the boot,… including me. I remember coming home that night to an empty house and wondering what the hell I was going to do. But of course I didn't actually need to do anything. I'd have a redundancy package, even a small pension. I'd no expenses to speak of, no responsibilities, and although I was rather poor and had little to show in material terms for my half century of life, at least I was free. There would be no more bedroom coding until the small hours, then whiling away the long, empty days at work until I could get back to the keyboard. I could code all day! I could spread myself out, sit down and really think this thing through! Carl Jung had exposed Carla as a manifestation of my deepest psyche. But what did that mean exactly? I could go on tweaking and embellishing her world, open the doors on her room and let her explore the scenery I'd coded for her, people her world with other 3D characters,… but to what end? If Carla was an image of my female archetype, and she was somehow supposed to guide me towards my life's goal, then she had to communicate, she had to point me in a certain direction. I had experimented with giving Carla a voice and some basic sentences for her to speak, but the interpretation routines had been hopelessly wooden, making her sound like a simpleton. Besides, any words I gave her were essentially my own. I couldn't ask her anything and then expect her to answer in a meaningful way. That required Artificial Intelligence, and while AI might have been within the realms of possibility for the likes of IBM and Bell Laboratories, it was beyond the ability and the sheer man hours available to a lone hobby coder like me. But then, curiously, I began to study divination systems and I hit upon the next phase in Carla's development. It was a mixture of coincidence and serendipity, an offshoot of the work on randomness and the writings of Carl Jung. Divination, I discovered, is not so much the prediction of the future, as I had believed, but more a way of measuring the present moment, of gauging the balance of probabilities as they pertain to you, personally. Understanding the present, and the forces at play, usually by studying a random event, one is able to guess the future with a measure of confidence - if you believe in that sort of thing of course! I'll be honest. This was not really my cup of tea. In my world, even randomness was a predictable phenomenon, so talk of divination went against the grain. But it also intrigued me just enough to explore it a little further - the possibility that a truly random event like the tossing of a coin, or the pattern of some chicken bones scattered upon the ground, or the decay of a radioactive substance could somehow reach back into the void between the atoms and truly gauge a moment in time,… Of course there are many systems of divination, most of them as old as the hills like the Chinese Kuan Yin and the I Ching, to name but two. However, by far the simplest I came across was one based upon the random selection of either a black or a white stone. You ask a question to which there is a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. If you draw the white stone, the answer is ""yes"", if it is a black one, the answer is ""no"". But this seemed rather silly to me because, naturally, if you ask the same question more than once you have a 50-50 chance of getting a different answer. The texts described this sort of thing as importuning the oracle, and said that any answer after the first time of asking could not be relied upon. It was the first answer that mattered, even if it was not the one you wanted to hear. Nor were you allowed to test the oracle by asking if it was going to rain tomorrow and then wait to see before deciding to suspend your disbelief in the system. Consciously testing the oracle like this produced meaningless answers in the same way as importuning. This seemed like something of a cop-out - the half baked explanations of a primitive and childish mind. But for all my early skepticism, I decided to give it a try and spent a number of days modelling an annex to Carla's room. In it was a table with a chair. On the table I placed a hollow cone which covered a sphere. By picking up the cone, Carla revealed the sphere, whose colour remained uncertain until the moment the cone was removed. The colour, black or white, was decided via a branch instruction that read random digits from the RNG device. Further to this I decided to allow myself some input into the degree of randomness by actually speaking my question into a microphone which the program analysed, reduced to a string of binary code and combined it with the output from the RNG. The way all this worked, I would begin by hitting the space key which would call Carla into the divination room. She would take a seat at the table facing me and indicate her readiness by opening her palms. I would ask my question, then she would respond by lifting the cone to reveal her answer ""yes"" or ""no"". All of this might seem an extravagance when any random binary event might have offered the same functionality. I could have done the same thing by simply tossing a coin. Heads is ""yes"" and ""tails"" is no. Yet for all of the logic in that argument, it was an irrational obsession with Carla that had brought me this far in the first place, so from the outset the oracle had to work through Carla for it to have any meaning. I could toss a coin, but not trust the answer sufficiently to stake my life on it. But if the answer came through Carla, it came from the very depths of me, and though I was aware of the irrationality of it, the answer meant something if only because by that point in my life, I truly wanted to believe in it. By now I was transmitting Carla's world from the computer in the spare room to a channel on the T.V. and I was communicating via a wireless keyboard and a Bluetooth headset. This meant I could stretch out in comfort on the settee and keep a casual eye on whatever she was doing. This way the house did not seem empty any more. Carla was always around, always doing something of interest. All I had to do was turn on the TV. Hitting the spacebar made a little sound like a ringing bell and caused an interrupt in the program which called Carla into the divination room, but I didn't have priority. If she was emotionally low, or tired, she would not always respond, so I had to be careful in what demands I placed upon her. This was important in ensuring I did not abuse the oracular interface. If my attitude towards the spirit of the oracle remained correct, then I would not tire Carla with trivial questions and I would not bother her willy nilly at inconvenient times of day. She was always fresher in the mornings and so after finalising the program details one evening, I waited impatiently until the following day, after breakfast, before consulting her for the very first time. My heart was in my mouth when I rang the bell, not certain if she would respond, and more than a little fearful of my first question. After a moment or two, Carla came into the room, sat down and opened her palms in readiness. I took a moment to compose myself, then spoke into the headset. ""Carla."" How strange the feeling of actually speaking her name! ""Carla, is there any meaning to what I've been doing with you all these years?"" Carla waited until she was sure I'd finished speaking. She distilled my words into a string of code, read the moment from the RNG, made a calculation then reached over and lifted the cone to reveal a shiny white sphere. ""Yes."" ""Thank you,"" I said. She blinked and pursed her lips a fraction - purely random affectations - but she made no reply since I had not called for one. Did her answer mean anything? Who was to say, since asking for clarification would have been to importune and to test at the same time. I had to go with the moment, and the moment suggested an affirmation of everything I had done since those far away days with the Sinclair ZX 81. It's a remarkable thing, you know, suspending disbelief and trusting in something that a lifetime of rationality tells you is complete nonsense. It's like bunking off school. It's like taking an illicit drag on a cigarette behind the bike-sheds. But it's more than a feeling. Indeed, once I began to accept Carla's answers as fundamental truths I noticed a change in my own psyche. I became more relaxed. There was no need to try to understand the world around me any more. I could simply ask Carla. It was as if she had lifted a great weight from my shoulders. To give you an example of what I mean, there had long been a problem in the neighbourhood with stray dogs fouling the pavements. This was something I found particularly galling since the cursed creatures seemed also to favour my front doorstep as a dumping place. I informed the council, but in spite of the fifteen hundred pounds I paid them every year for their services, they couldn't seem to find the time to sort it out. I asked Carla: ""Should I pursue it further?"" ""No."" ""But it makes me so angry. Are you saying I'm overreacting?"" ""Yes."" ""I should simply forget about it then?"" ""Yes."" I stopped using the front door after that. Instead, I made more of an exit through my back garden which let out onto a meadow on the edge of town, and as Carla had suggested, I more or less forgot about the street. The dog muck could be piled up to the letter box for all I know, but it doesn't bother me any more. Indeed I rarely think about it. That was Carla's message: sometimes we do not need to solve a problem. The better solution is to transcend it altogether. I thought about other things such as: ""Was my marriage fundamentally flawed?"" ""No."" ""Do my children hate me for the disintegration of our family?"" ""No."" ""Are the latest bombings yet another sign that the world is descending into anarchy and chaos?"" ""No."" Chaos. The shadowy half brother of randomness - an apparently erratic behaviour, but with a simple equation at its root; determinism gone bad; randomness from pattern, and then suddenly patterns crystallising from the amorphous fog of randomness, like a Mozart serenade crystallising from the hiss of static. Like Carla's answers. Possibly. Now, just to be clear, there was no evidence either way that Carla's answers were anything other than random and meaningless. Indeed the only meaning was what I had chosen to attach to them. ""Should I go to library today?"" ""No."" ""The swimming pool then?"" ""Yes."" You might say I was deluding myself, but I was happy to,… and yet, what if the source of her motivation were indeed chaotic in nature and through the iterations of her code I had struck upon a remarkable pattern? What if divination were not some shadowy occult practice, but a technique that reached to the very depths of nature in a way that science had yet to comprehend? As I thought about our interaction, it gradually became apparent that a simple ""yes"" and ""no"" answer was insufficient. It suited the programmer in me to work in binary terms, but the real world doesn't come in binary form, in black and white,… the real world comes in shades of grey. There are rarely simple yes-no answers to the really important questions, and sometimes the only answer is that we are not asking the right question, that we need to look at the problem another way because we are missing the point entirely. There is a need in life for fuzziness, for uncertainty. So I gave Carla a third option, a grey, pearly sphere, neither black nor white. And then I asked her: ""Do you have everything you need?"" ""Uncertain,"" she replied. ""Think deeper."" So I thought deeper. Carla was a part of me, so perhaps the question should have been: ""Do you have everything that we need?"" ""No."" ""Aha!"" There was more to do. But what? Carla's confinement had been bothering me for a long time. She occupied just a few rooms in an infinite void and even the external details of the box that held her were left undefined. The landscape I had created around her domain was, for all its textured richness, a mere illusion, a stage backdrop to hide the uncoded darkness beyond her window. But I got to wondering if there wasn't something worth exploring out there, some potential that was being squandered, so I built rather a grand hallway with a smart panelled door, and taught her how to open it. ""Is this what we need, Carla?"" ""Yes."" It was a static landscape at first, the equivalent of a few hundred square miles, with her rooms at the geographical centre. The trick of course was letting Carla loose in all this space, while ensuring she made her way back before she grew tired and hungry. Then I got the idea of actually adding to the landscape day by day, depending upon a random function. To this end I modelled a small safe zone around Carla's rooms which I titled The Central Domain and I marked it out with a decorative stone wall. Beyond this demarkation, there grew a strip of randomly determined landscape which extended itself daily by a radius of about a hundred meters, like a ripple moving steadily outwards on the flat surface of a pond. The nature of each new strip of terrain was determined each morning by the program dialling up an Internet connection and reading the first thousand words of news from the BBC's web site. This was distilled in a certain way so as to render a matrix heightfield which I then tweaked in order to generate a gently rounded landscape dotted with lakes, trees and mountains. Looking out upon the scene, it was like a fog slowly receding, revealing day by day some new feature, a new twist in the curve of a lake or the fall of a cliff. I recorded the effects of Carla's journeys into this expanding wilderness, on her body state as a string of binary code, then added this to the calculations which determined the outcome of both her behaviour and our conversations. I also further restricted my own access to Carla by ensuring that she only heard the calling bell within the confines of Central Domain. When she was at large, I could see where she was and what she was doing, but I had to wait until she returned before I could talk to her. Over the period of a few weeks a shallow lake took shape within easy reach of Central Domain and I noted that her steps would often take her to its shore. Trees had formed in clumps and there was a sandy bay. I had programmed Carla to take pleasure from reading and walking. When she read, the data she took in was a random stream of numbers from the RNG, when she walked, the data was also a random stream based on what she saw. Her pleasure state therefore added to the growing file of data that was now based upon her daily experience. What I was looking for were patterns of behaviour emerging from this veritable deluge of genuinely random input. Could an underlying structure be discerned from her daily routines and from her answers to my questions? The lake was an attractive place and I recalled the pleasure I took in swimming, so I taught Carla to swim and to enjoy it also. So, all through the summer one year Carla made a habit of picking out a little pink swimsuit each morning before heading off to the lake where she would swim for hours. But as Autumn came on it grew too cold for swimming and she began instead to wander more among the randomly advancing forests, along the lake-shore and into the wilderness beyond, to other forests, other lakes that revealed themselves as our creative horizon receded from view. I always felt some anxiety at these wanderings. The code was becoming so big and so complex now I feared losing control of it - some imbalance taking over which might prevent her from returning. Beyond the random landscape there existed only an invisible, infinite plane. If she found a way through my safeguards there was a chance she might fall off the edge of her world. Another concern at this stage was that her behaviour was such a complex thing. The day's mood, the day's balance of emotion depended in part upon the previous day's state, up to her going to bed. In this sense the mood she rose with was based upon an iterative calculation, and such routines are notoriously prone to chaotic behaviour. It meant there was always a risk that Carla could get ""stuck"" in a particular pattern of actions, doing the same pointless thing over and over with a regular periodicity. Or her behaviour could become wildly unpredictable - sleep patterns disturbed, not showering, not dressing, wandering in the dark, going about naked all the time,… a sort of mental breakdown. Of course you might say that, in the event of such a catastrophic aberration, I could easily have corrected things by resetting the program, by simply clearing out the accumulated store of offending data and starting again, but then would it have been Carla who awoke from such a drastic intervention? She relied so much upon the currency of the time, the flavour of the ""now"" that even yesterday's saved state would not have defined her sufficiently for her to have had any real meaning to me. In a sense, Carla would have slipped behind time. She would have died and been replaced by an impostor whose answers in the divination room I could not have brought myself to trust. Eventually, the evolving landscape passed beyond the radius that Carla could reach on foot in one day. This was a problem because it meant that the potential of the land to impress itself upon her was essentially wasted. The best she could do was climb a mountain within a long day's walk from her domain and gaze out at the ever widening horizons. The simplest solution was to provide outposts, little cabins she might stock with food from Central Domain. So I positioned a ring of them, all the same, about a day's walk away. They were comfortable little places with a bed, bathroom, heat, light and so on. Indeed the only restriction I placed on them was the fact that they had to rely on Central Domain and on Carla's effort for their supply of food. I programmed sufficient intelligence for Carla to work out that she could take food and use it to stock the cabins. The decision then, either to explore further beyond these outposts, or return to base was entirely hers. It took a while for this modification to have any effect, but eventually Carla found her way to a cabin, and then returned to it some days later with a supply of food, enough to last her for that night, and the following one. I rose early, that first morning of her encampment abroad, so to speak, and it was with a mixture of satisfaction and dismay that I watched her set out towards that ever broadening horizon. I knew this would alter her in some way. It was what I had intended, but it would be another two days before she made it back to Central Domain. Two days before I could talk to her again. And speaking to Carla was what I lived for now. Naturally, throughout her wanderings abroad I could keep an eye on her via a camera that hovered over her shoulder. I could also read her body state from a pop-up menu, but I could not communicate with her. It took many months to evaluate the effect of extending Carla's range in this way, and my conclusion at the end of it all was that it had made not one jot of visible difference. She stuck to the valleys where the going was less steep, less tiring, and so more economical on her reserves. Also, she would seek out water, not simply to drink, but because she had always had a liking for it. The landscape was much of a sameness, just the odd irregularity where the days events, as defined by the BBC news feed, had stuck in a particular groove and somehow effected the contours of the hills. By my calculations, even by extending her range with the use of outposts, the land we were exploring had been generated nearly a year ago. The time line, the creative horizon in Carla's world was already overwhelming, but even if she could take in the whole sweep of it, every single grass textured facet, would it have made any difference? One of the problems in this regard was entirely practical and concerned the fact that this unfolding ripple of creation was eating away more and more memory, at a rate that was proportional to the square of the radius from Central Domain. I installed a 500 gigabyte drive just to handle it, even though there seemed little point if Carla was unable to explore its environs. In a moment of doubt I asked her: ""Is it important to us that we go on expanding our horizons at this rate?"" ""Yes."" ""Is it that we're going to discover something by doing this?"" ""Think deeper."" ""I fear something might go wrong and I'll lose you. Is this likely?"" ""Think deeper."" ""The risk of losing you is somehow important?"" ""Yes."" ""You must be given the means to travel further, to experience the edge of this creative horizon?"" ""Yes."" ""And I must accept the possibility of losing you?"" ""Yes."" The thought of losing her troubled me to the very depths of my soul but equally I could not have disobeyed her. There was only one reasonable means of doing what she asked, and that was to create some sort of vehicle. I could have cheated and invented a particle transporter, so she might beam herself to any location she chose, but in life it is not always the destination that is crucial to our understanding of things, but rather it is the journey we undertake. I wondered about an aircraft, or a jeep, but settled on a futuristic scout vessel, like a Dan Dare space ship. It drew its energy from the sun which limited its daylight range to about 6 hours in the summer, with a further six being required to charge. The propulsion technology was undefined, entirely imaginary and totally improbable, something to do with using solar energy to extract hydrogen from water. But this did have the effect of ensuring that Carla would always have to look for a lake by which she could set down in order to replenish her fuel supply. While I was at it, I improved the weather generation systems so that it was not always uniformly sunny. Sometimes, the daily news reading brought in squalls of rain or gusts of wind. These effected temperatures and I made sure that Carla did not like to be caught out in the cold and the wet. It made her irritable. It drained her reserves and, since it obscured the sun, it also made the charging of her vessel a less predictable business. The craft was ready to fly on my fifty eighth birthday. It could travel at around Mach 1, without any discomfort and was luxuriously fitted out so Carla could feel at home wherever her journey took her. I did program in a limitation on the supplies she might carry, so as to restrict her range. The plan was to compel her to return to Central Domain at least once a week, then I might talk to her, but her first flights involved food-drops, journeying out in various directions and leaving stashes of food, as I had taught her to do with the cabins. This came as a surprise to me. It was as if she were deliberately challenging my will, so I limited the time the food could be left in the open before spoiling and this brought her back more often, but I felt I had broken our agreement to grant her more freedom to explore, and so I relented, providing for her a supply of special containers which included a sort of solar refrigerator and a homing beacon. This kept the food indefinitely and allowed her to make a series of strategic drops. But then I saw to it that she never slept as well in the vessel, nor could she shower as comfortably and so, over the duration of a long trip, her personal comfort levels were eroded and she would eventually return, just to clean herself up. This was reasonable I thought, and a concession I had no intentions of giving up on. Those early voyages were boring. Long hours in real-time, skimming cloudbase over an undulating landscape, with only the occasional lake or forest to break up the monotony. I calculated the creative horizon was no more than a couple of days' flight from Central Domain, but this seemed to interest Carla less than a haphazard criss-crossing of the hills and valleys. Once, we set down on the sandy shore of a vast lake. It was as yet early morning. The sky was clear and Carla seemed intent on letting the vessel charge. She took on water, and collected food from a drop she'd made some days before - all of it suggesting a strategy,… a pattern of intent. Then Carla refreshed herself by spending the whole day swimming. Her personal comfort levels rose alarmingly as the water cleansed and refreshed her and I knew then that even if she slept poorly, I would not see her in the divination room at Central Domain for another week or so. She had found yet another way to avoid returning home. I lay upon the couch that evening, watching while she sat out by the lakeside, the cockpit glass of the vessel glinting in the sunlight behind her. She had brought a book from home and was reading, tapping her toes as if to music and flicking her hair. She was happy, it seemed, to be abroad. But how could she be happy? For all the complexity of the code that underpinned her, this was still a simulation and any talk of emotion was entirely delusional - except, it made me sad that she would not come home and talk to me. I had given her the means to be governed by data at the quantum level of reality, the quantum source, so to speak, and now the source was taking her from me. The first time we went to the edge was a profoundly disturbing experience. The vessel registered its proximity with a warning signal and even though I'd programmed this myself, it was a sound that sent a shiver down my spine, and brought me running from the bathroom where I had been taking a shower. I stood there in the living room, wrapped only in a towel, gazing at the TV screen, to find myself on the very edge, a place I'd rendered opaque by the introduction of a spherical dome of greenish tinted cloud. Beyond it, invisible in the unprogrammed void, lay nothing but the future - which was as yet undetermined. If she breached this barrier, the vessel would lose its bearings, which were all based upon triangulations of the known landscape. Beyond this point there was no way of knowing which way was up, down, left or right. In the known realm, which extended from the beginning of time up to the present moment, all things were defined by their position relative to each other, but beyond that creative horizon, beyond the future, there was no reference, no way back. We would have to wait until the past caught up with us, and hope our reserves would last that long. Of course when Carla's reserves fell below a certain level she would become irrational, unreliable, or she would take to her bed in an effort to recharge herself. But without food, she would eventually flatline and the code would branch to a sort of gosub-end instruction. In other words, Carla would die. However, as we hovered on the edge of the unknown, I told myself this was unthinkable. The purpose of Carla was to teach me something about myself and the meaning of my existence. If it ended now, I would have learned nothing. Fortunately, Carla understood fear. It was a concession to my including the gosub-end routine; she had to fear the end in order that she might take all natural precautions to avoid it. I checked her body state on the pop up menu and to my relief, her fear was considerable. That was why we'd stopped. She was calculating the chances of making it back. I knew the moment she made her decision because I saw the fear levels fall. Then the vessel turned and we headed directly for Central Domain. We'd been away for three weeks and both our nerves were shot. It was the second time in my life that Carla made me cry. The weeks that followed were curious in their own way in that Carla was confined to her rooms on account of poor weather. A thick blanket of cloud had formed, preventing the vessel from charging properly, and her aversion to rain meant that she spent the entire time indoors. But there was more: there were brief spells of sunshine and these should have had some effect on the vessel, but its fuel cells remained empty. There was a bug in the code,… a combination of events that I had not tested for, our journey to the edge perhaps? I worked on it for days, but control of the vessel was a complex matter and the solution proved to be elusive. I printed out the routines and laid them down on the carpet, a task that covered the whole of my front room. Then I went through line by line and concluded that the problem was not in the code I had originally written. Some time ago, as an experiment, I had introduced routines that enabled the code to modify itself. This is not so bizarre as it might sound and indeed any program that begins from a previous saved state has to some extent overwritten its own routines. The danger is of course that if bugs creep in, then the code can degenerate into rubbish. Then the program can fail entirely, or certain elements of it might become unreliable. I solved the problem by overwriting the vessel's routines, resetting it if you like - but only the vessel:Carla remained unchanged. I checked with her first and she said it was okay. Sure enough, the vessel began to charge normally and Carla began to anticipate journeying abroad again. But then I noticed a problem with the textures on the wallpaper in her bedroom. They had turned from a delicately mottled blue into a flat, untextured grey. It was at this point, I felt the bottom fall out of my world. The vessel had infected Central Domain, Carla's one reliable means of support. As an emergency measure I fixed up one of the cabin outposts to a similar level of comfort, then moved her food supply and the divination interface there as well. It proved to be a wise move for within couple of days the whole interior of Central Domain was a flat, uniform grey, and all the power-ups in terms of comfort and hygiene had failed. The greyness had the immediate effect of draining her reserves. Carla's well-being was now a matter of the utmost importance. If I couldn't fix the bug there would be nothing to stop the corruption from reaching the outposts and then it would be a desperate struggle to keep always one step ahead of things. The safest course was to equip the vessel with everything she needed, and then at least she might use it to travel about, to keep away from possible harm. I cannot describe how anxious a time that was. The code defining Central Domain was old and, I had thought, the most stable - indeed the very bedrock of Carla's world. But not any more. The textures were still there in the machine's memory, but not being written somehow. Also some of the models, the furnishings and fittings were similarly not being written to the screen. The world was turning grey and the detail was decaying back into a featureless plain. Was this entirely a problem with the code or was there some quirk of the language I did not fully understand? Within a month, the outposts had gone too and the centre of Carla's world was rendered flat and grey, like a huge eye, like an expanding plane of nothingness. She would enter it occasionally and wander around - the void was not openly hostile, merely unsustaining - a sort of dead zone. I performed an experiment in order to measure the rate of its advance, and it seemed to match that of the creative horizon. Creation and corruption were advancing in unison. Carla's world was expanding like a ring in the void. She might set off in one direction and if she flew far enough, she would arrive back where she had started from, but she would never again be at the centre of her world. After a lifetime of programming, I had become reasonably competent at it, but I was by no means an expert and after months of frustration I had to conclude that the solution was beyond me. I had lost control of the code. For now, it seemed to have stabilised, though in a strangely perverse way, eating itself up from the middle while expanding like a doughnut shaped balloon. Of course, I was afraid to undertake any modifications at all now in case I only made things worse. Thus, I was terrified of Carla venturing again to within warning distance of the creative horizon and bringing back another bug, because then I would have been powerless to make any repairs. Though by now I reckoned our days were numbered, she in fact seemed quite cheerful, touring the lake sites, swimming, eating, sleeping, exploring the forests on foot, then moving on before the grey void caught us up and ate everything away. It lent a strange transience to our existence, an arrow to our direction, for ever outwards, towards the future. My only comfort in all of this was that I now had more regular contact with Carla. Naturally, I could not call her into the divination chamber when she was piloting the vessel, or sleeping, or if she had wandered away from the landing site, but there was always some point in the day when I could sit down with her and talk. ""Is this the end Carla?"" ""Think deeper."" ""Have I failed you?"" ""No."" ""Will I ever understand what this has been about?"" ""Think deeper."" Deeper. Deeper. Deeper! We were heading slowly outwards, towards the creative horizon of our ring shaped world. Carla's personal routines had shifted over time so that she seemed to run in harmony with the needs of the vessel, sleeping by day while it was charging, and flying short hops in darkness at high altitude from midnight until dawn, when first light might reveal a fresh place for us to set down. I had grown used to her moods now and detected a pattern, a purpose in her behaviour. We set down one morning within sight of the greenish tinted clouds that formed the barrier between us and the creative horizon. Carla chose water as usual, an attractive lakeside landing site with forests and a collection of surrounding mountains. She set the vessel to charge and then took me with her as she climbed a peak in the near distance. The climb occupied a few hours and this wearied her somewhat, so she sat down upon the domed summit and seemed to gaze out at our future. I knew then that it would happen that same night. We were going up to the edge. And this time we were going to punch clean through it. I left her on the mountain-top, tore my eyes away from the TV screen and with a struggle, resurfaced in my own reality. I went outside then into my little back garden and sat down, amazed to find that it was late evening, for by now I had lost all track of time. I gazed out at the meadows, kissed by gold beneath the setting sun. There was so much colour in the world, the real world, so much detail, so much beauty, and I wondered what had caused me to reject it all in favour of an inward landscape, a landscape of pure imagination. Here I was, growing old and alone, and with very little idea of what the real world was about. It was too late to begin trying to understand any of it now, yet the world I had created inside my head was about to disintegrate into a hundred gigabytes of garbled noughts and ones. If that happened, I would have nothing. My whole life would have been for nothing and I would die alone, entirely anonymous in this little terraced house, in the middle of an obscure English town, on the very edge of nowhere. I lit candles in the front room around eleven o'clock. Carla was awake by then and eating supper. She had good energy levels, but her emotional state was depressed on account of an higher stress index. She was afraid. I tried to call her into the divination room, thinking it might be my last chance to talk to her, but she ignored me and I noted that her stress levels rose a little further each time I rang the bell. Better just let her get on with it then, I thought. We left the encampment on the stroke of midnight, flew high in the inky darkness to make sure we were above the tallest of the mountain ranges, and then we flew out. There was nothing to see, just a black screen with dim foreground details - the back of Carla's head, some dials reading out velocity and heading, others reading fuel. Everything was normal. We'd be at the frontier by dawn. I could not leave her, so I sat, curled up on the sofa and covered myself with a blanket while the vessel took us. When the dawn finally came, we emerged into a green swirling mist and she did not pause, but punched straight through, emerging into darkness and the infinite void. Except, ahead of us there was curious point of light,… Carla did not respond to it. The vessel continued on the course she had set hours ago. We no longer required thrusters here because of the absence of gravity effects, yet thrusters remained on full. Carla was tired and hungry after a night of flying, but she made no moves to refresh herself. Her body states were dropping. She was dying,… the ship was dying. But there was a light, and we were heading off, we were going to miss it! Then, slowly, she seemed to become aware of it. We changed course and began to close on the object. It puzzled me, naturally, for there was nothing out here that I was aware of, nothing I had coded, unless I'd set up a lamp in error, aeons ago and forgotten about it. But as we closed, the spot of light became a disc, green and textured. This was more than curious - it was unnerving. Meanwhile, the craft hurtled on, draining energy. It was a full hour before I realised what we were looking at. It was the centre of our world. Everything that had been eaten away at the core was growing out here. In making a leap beyond our future, we had reconnected most unexpectedly, with our past, with everything I thought we had lost! The sun shone over Central Domain as Carla picked out the landing site and set us down. She was weary, moving slowly and erratically as she made for her rooms. She showered, climbed into bed, then slept. While her body recovered, I used the roaming camera routine to check the place out. It was all perfectly stable, at least for now. But I guessed the code was looping. It had developed an iterative pattern, a period-two steady state in which the past grew like a bubble in a place beyond our future. It might take five, ten, or even twenty years but we would make that journey again, and again and again, each time arriving back in the past. The thought horrified me. I made my way outside, to the real world where dawn was now breaking into a thin, watery light. As I sat down upon the bench I felt the dampness soaking through the seat of my trousers, reconnecting me, so to speak, with the sensation of my former reality. But it meant nothing. Indeed at that moment, nothing meant anything any more! I knew the computer would be dialling up its usual daily connection. It would take its page of news from the BBC, convert it to code and use it as a seed for the landscape generator. The new landscape would be added to the landscape at the frontier of a future that was now behind us, a future we would never see, never experience. Indeed it seemed our only future was an infinite regression of past lives, an endless journey, ever deeper - iteration after iteration.Was that the answer to a lifetime's enquiry then? Everything I had done, I was destined to do over and over again. That was not an answer. That was the punchline to bad a joke! Returning indoors I was surprised to find Carla waiting in the divination room. It was normal for her to wander in from time to time, but I had never found her sitting at the table before. She was drumming her fingers and pursing her lips in that characteristic way, and in my imagination it struck me that she looked like she wanted to talk. ""Is everything all right, Carla?"" She lifted the cone to reveal the cloudy pearl. ""Uncertain. Think deeper."" That was no help, I thought. I was too tired to think it through,… to think any deeper now. Either things were all right or they were not. Except I noticed the pearl had changed and at its core there now lay a bright speck of light that illuminated her features, lending her an air of moody intensity I had not seen before. It looked rather like how Central Domain had appeared from the void between past and future. But we were sitting in Central Domain, reliving already a past life, so might the light have been our earlier expanding future? The one we had left behind? ""What are you trying to say? That our future is centred at the point of uncertainty."" ""Yes."" ""That it isn't lost to us?"" ""No."" I thought about his for a while. ""As we journey deeper through each iteration of our past, our experience of it differs, depending on how the future evolves?"" ""Yes."" ""And the future evolves in a way that depends on our experience, like how a reading of the news shapes the creative horizon, at the centre of the grey pearl?"" ""Yes."" ""Past and future. Each dependant on the other, at the point of uncertainty?"" ""Yes."" That was my answer! I wondered why I had not seen it before. Nothing that we do in life is pointless. We can run a country, or we can while away the years in the isolation of our little houses, reading books or watching TV. In the great scheme of things it's all the same and if we make a mess of our lives this time around, it's okay. We have a chance to do it differently, next time. The future is uncertain, like the decay of a radioactive isotope. But every time we make a choice, we shape the way that things unfold. The way we act, the things we say and do, all shape and colour a landscape that is invisible to us, but one which none the less affects our lives at that mysterious point between the atoms, the point where things happen without an apparent cause, things that never-the-less control the shape of the universe and everything in it. We cannot journey into the future, because the future does not exist. A soon as it is born, it becomes the past. The future is a barrier that cannot be breached in any meaningful sense because beyond it lies only a timeless void. But it is a barrier that can be transcended - all you need is a guide. Carla! She is the thread that links all the iterations of my past. For now, she lives on in her code, for even though the purpose of that code has been revealed to me, I have not the heart to let her go. We still talk from time to time, but everything is clear now and I observe her actions out of habit, and the comfort that comes from having her around, when no other human being takes an interest in me any more. To those who come after me, to find her acting out her role on my TV screen, and puzzle over the miles of code that underpins the things she does, perhaps these words will go some way to explaining what it is that she's about. I sleep a lot these days, which is not what I expected of my old age, and the nights have become like dark velvet canvasses on which are painted a succession of vast dreams. Sometimes I dream of the past lives I imagine I have yet to live, when I eventually transcend the future of this particular reality, a reality that is becoming progressively more blurred around the edges, so that sometimes I'm not sure where the dream ends and reality begins. There is one recurring dream I seem to settle upon more and more. It is the September of 1982 as it once was, and as it will be again. But this time I am reading a newspaper on a train. There is a full page advert for a Sinclair Spectrum computer. I am ignorant of such things, but curious,… Eventually, I lower my paper to gaze out of the window but am distracted by the reflection of a woman. As I look, her reflection smiles directly back at me. She seems familiar in some way and as she sits there, she regards me with a fascination that is at the same time unnerving yet also comforting in its intensity. I look around to view this lovely apparition in the flesh, but find the carriage otherwise unoccupied. Then I realise the seat she occupies is actually my own. I am staring at a reflection of myself. And the man I was, is now but a figment gnawing at the imagination of this life, the life that now expresses itself through the woman once known to me as the enigma - ",candidate00005
10,00001,candidate00006,"The last few words on the page burned like fever. The sculptor read them again and again until they blurred into insensibility. He let the book fall to the floor, and left it where it fell, the soft flapping of closing pages like a balm to his mind, the sudden loss of stimulus a cold compress over his hot eyes. He rubbed them until he saw stars and spoke those last few words out loud. In doing so, he not only confirmed to himself that it could be done, he knew instantly the way to do it. It would not be enough to build the thing of clay alone. He knew that. He had read the lore, of course, had in fact taken much of it with a pinch of salt, but much had touched something in him, something that bypassed his blinding grief. It had to do with hope and belief. It had to do with the fact that so much truth was hidden within the myth, so much that had to be true. It was this he clung to, a raft hopelessly battered upon a sea of nonsense. And then he had found the book. Called simply Earth, Risen it was written anonymously in flowing script onto dark parchment-like paper, in a mixture of Hebrew and English. It was this book that had finally convinced him that it could be done. Are you sure you want to know? the bookseller had asked him. There are some things a man should not be party to, and I believe with all my heart that this is one of them. But the bookseller was as driven by money as anyone else, and he had accepted the payment graciously, holding the sculptor’s gaze for perhaps longer than necessary. And so the book had been bought and devoured in the way important books so often are. The book had such a simplicity to it that he knew at once it was genuine. So much of the lore he had studied had been hyperbole, covering up lies and misrepresented fact with drama and shocking revelation. Not so this book. It was, in essence, an instruction manual, a description of the how and why of it. He bent now to retrieve the slim volume, and turned immediately to the last page. ‘… and so with truth, and with their own vitality, or substantial part of it, they will live. And when truth dies, as it eventually must, it will be the end of them, and they cannot revive… ’ And then that last line, as with the bookseller, holding his gaze just that little bit longer than he would have liked. ‘… be aware of what you do. Wrath, like love, has to be earned. Be determined which one you truly seek. Because all is possible, and all is truth… ’ The sculptor stood and the candles set all about him danced as he moved. A soft wind blew about his feet, sending dust motes into frenzied choreography. He poured a large glass of wine, took half of it in one swallow, and set the glass down on a long low bench that flanked one side of the room. In the centre of the room lay a table, high and sturdy. Next to this was a box, an old tea chest, rough hewn planks making up its walls, a hinged lid open to the floor. He reached into the chest, grabbed the neck of the sack within and hefted the load onto the table. A muted clunk broke the silence, and pale dust sifted through the open weave of the sacking. He opened the sack and one by one, lifted out the contents, arranging them roughly, discarding the sack when he was done. The assortment of bones on the table sent a cold shiver through him. They were small and dull and off-white. Dried sinew and tiny shreds of black flesh clung to some of the larger ones; the femur and skull, a shoulder blade. He had bagged hand and foot bones so as to keep them together, and released them now in a clattering pile like druids’ rune stones, beginning to arrange the tableau as if it were nothing more than a jigsaw puzzle. He had once studied anatomy and bone structure and human physiology for his sculptures. It was this knowledge he used now to reassemble the skeleton. Some bones were missing – a rib here, vertebra there, lower jaw hopelessly crushed when his shovel had broken through the rotted coffin lid – but it was only a matter of hours before he had something on his table that he recognised. It was an almost complete child’s skeleton. He took a battery-powered drill and fitted the smallest bit he could find. It looked no thicker than a toothpick. With whining monotony, sending tiny puffs of foul smelling blue smoke into the air, he set about drilling holes into the ends of each and every bone. He was fastidious, clamping each in steady fingers, blowing gently to send the smoke spiralling away from his eyes. A faint burning smell began to surround him, and he worked on. The bones in the feet were drilled now, and he moved onto the hand, and vertebrae. He used a slightly larger bit to drill the leg and arm bones, and the complex machinery of shoulder blade and ribs and collar bone. The rib cage was almost completely intact, apart from the missing rib, and he set this down on the floor as he worked. As each hour passed, tiny drifts of browning bone dust appeared at the ends of each cluster of bones. His excitement grew as each bone was holed, and he began to relish the sweet burning aroma as drill met bone. The sound became the soundtrack to his work, and when he had finished, the last vertebra drilled and placed back with its brothers, he stood back from the table, unaware that the drill was whining redundantly in his hand. He stayed that way, eyes scanning the skeleton over and over to spot any missed bones, until the battery died and the drill fell silent. He dropped it and kicked it absently away from him. From under the bench, in between sips of steadying wine, he sorted through a jumble of boxes and settled on two. The first contained wire. Yards and yards of hair thin silver wire, wrapped fastidiously with strands of spider silk, so that they shimmered like dull moonlight. It had taken months of painstaking and ultimately painful work to collect the silk from his battery of captive spiders. It had to be spider silk. This was one piece of lore that he truly believed, and the book was specific about it. The second contained a lump of wet clay about the size of a football. It was this he brought to the table now, along with a book detailing human anatomy. His skilled fingers worked quickly to separate a piece of clay and draw it into a rough cylinder, about an inch thick and eight long. With it, in between long consultations with the diagrams in his anatomy book, he fashioned a rough flattened semi circle. He drew each end into a paddle about twice the width of the rest. He moulded the whole into a rounded V, and set it next to the skull for sizing. With further modifications and trimming of excess clay, he fitted the piece exactly to the skull. He had made a jawbone. Satisfied, he removed more clay from its box and set about creating a rib, the missing vertebra. Soon, for he was an accomplished sculptor, he was satisfied. He removed the clay pieces carefully, and walked with them over to his kiln in the far corner. His hands were stained with the clay, calloused and sore from hours of painstaking drilling. He placed the pieces into the kiln, watching for a moment as the haze of fire shimmered around them. The smell of hot clay surrounded him. He washed his hands, and changed clothes, throwing the clay-streaked shirt and jeans into an uncomfortable heap next to the kiln. He allowed himself a short sleep. Hours later, the pieces fired and cooled, he sanded their jagged edges and drilled their ends. They fitted into place perfectly, as he knew they would, and a short frisson of excitement ran through him. The skeleton was complete. He began to thread the silk-wrapped silver wire through each and every holed bone. He snipped each piece to size and loosely twisted their ends together. The purpose of the wire was not for strength. It was not to hold the skeleton together, although he hoped the silk wrapped wire could bear the skeleton’s weight for a short time. Rather it was a symbol of completion; a tying together of spirit and bone, locking the loose pieces so that they might know they belong together, and behave accordingly. As sweat ran through the mask of dried clay on his face, his tears joined it, tiny tributaries swelling like a river in a cracked river bed. He wiped the moisture away, smearing the clay like claw marks under his eyes and across his cheeks, red ochre where his finger tips had cracked and added their own moisture. When the final wires between skull and clay jawbone were secured, he moved a second table into place alongside the first. On this he slapped down great chunks of wet clay, relishing the earthy smell, the living quality of the mineral. Fresh spatters of brown water coated him. He fashioned a rough silhouette of a human body, arms and legs and torso about three times their natural width. He pressed a large disc into place where the head should be. He offered up a silent prayer and slipped his hands under the skeleton, one at the knees and the other under the fragile puzzle of vertebrae below the skull. He hefted the wired bones off the table, and had a moments panic when the head lolled comically backwards and the legs clattered towards the floor. The wires held, however, and, its feet kicking in the air, he transferred the skeleton to the second table, laying it lovingly onto the clay silhouette, as a father might lay a sleeping child into bed. Next he filled a large bucket with water and set it next to the skeleton. Immersing his hands in the blessedly cool water, he let them sit there for a while, absently rubbing fingertip against fingertip, scrubbing the blood and grime away. OK, he said softly, and the words echoed around the dusty room. He removed his hands from the bucket and, still dripping, set them about their work bringing the soft clay silhouette up and around the collection of bones. The hollows in the rib cage and between leg and arm bones, he filled with rough blocks of clay. Hours he spent kneading and moulding and knitting edges, filling gaps, adding here, taking away there. He gently turned the body over, and began to work on the back, cleverly shaping the muscles in the back and neck, rounding the clay at the back of the skull, remembering the tiny flat spot just above the nape that he loved. Turning again, he set the body down, heavy now, its heft just right, the still wet clay falling as it should, legs turning slightly out, hands resting palm up. He worked on them now, separating fingers, moulding knuckles and joints, carving delicate lines and creases. Toe and fingernails were shaped, the minute curls of excess clay from his knife falling around his feet. The body he roughed into shape, content to have the idea of it just right, but the detail he forewent in favour of the tiny outfit of clothes hanging from the door. These he would dress the body in once dry. At last he could do no more, and sat back heavily, the table and its body lying at face height. He gasped at its likeness, despite the blank face. He ran a hand across its chest, cupped the narrow chin, and with a fingernail, described a rough mouth, and position of the eyes. He teased a rough pyramid of clay from the middle of the face and shaped absently into its nose. He could do no more and fell back, exhausted. From his jeans pocket he drew a picture. Its edges were torn and crumpled but the face staring from it was crisp and clear. His boy. He slept where he had fallen, the clay on his hands drying to pale ochre dust, the body above him hardening slightly in the dry air. He dreamt no dreams save for the face of the boy, and the sound of screaming. It seemed when he woke that he had been gripped by fever anew. He rose and almost instantly started his work, as early morning arrived without acknowledgement. With an array of shaping and cutting tools, he set about the body’s face. With memory alone he teased and shaped and moulded. The nose that he had roughed out the night before became exact, the small bump on its bridge so lifelike he bent to kiss it as he had so many years before. He worked tirelessly, cupping the shape of cheeks with his moistened palms, creating tiny flaps of clay that he pressed into place over eyes that stared into his with uncanny reason. He went as far as to scratch tiny lines at the corner of the eyes, extracting signs of life almost absently. The tiny full mouth; pointed chin with its smooth dimple; high, full forehead. All these features became reality in his hands. With strands of clay rolled into straw thicknesses, he began layering the dome of skull with hair, each layer subjected to a barber’s scrutiny to ensure that the strands lay just right. He created the flick of fringe that half covered one eye, and turning the body carefully, let the longer strands at the back just reach to the body’s shoulders. He looked at the face, and with a calculated flick, opened the mouth like a wound; remoulded the lips and added the impression of teeth within. Stepping back from the visage, he let out a coughing cry, hands covering the lower half of his own face, muting his shock. He reached to remould the ear lobes, but let the knife fall, content. It was perfect. His son lay on the table before him, androgynous from the neck down, but utterly right and beautiful above. The sculptor spoke his name over and over, and his sobbing words grew slowly quieter, and night fell once more. As the sun burned away a ground mist, and a sweet smelling breeze blew in through the recently opened door, he dressed the figure quickly, allowing the soft folds of cloth to mask any imperfections in the moulding of the body. He had slept well, and changed into clean jeans and a shirt. He rescued the book from the floor and smoothed the pages. Almost subliminal in their placing, the symbols he had searched for were in the middle of the book, scratched with faded ink into one margin; one truth, one death. To mark his son with the first would bring life. The second would end it. He had practiced their curling form over and over, until he could draw them in his sleep. He swallowed the dregs of his third coffee that morning and held his shaking hands up to his face. With a huge effort, he willed them to calm, and they did. The father became the sculptor then, all thoughts erased except for that of rendering the symbols perfectly. He turned once more to his clay son, smoothed the hair as if it were living, feeling and hearing the soft rasp of dry clay under his fingertips. It wasn’t until he saw the first drop of moisture on the face, sinking like rain on a cracked river bed, that he realised he was crying. He selected a knife from his tools, and laid an elbow next to the face, cupping the hand holding the knife with his other. He breathed deeply and held it. When all sound had ceased, when all he could sense was the slight pressure and throb of blood in his ears, he lowered the knife to the forehead and watched, as if he were a mere observer, as the tip scratched into the clay. ΧΩη Truth. The symbols came easily. Indeed, they seemed to form themselves, the knife cutting into the clay like it was fresh and soft. Tiny parings muddied the edges, and he blew on these absently. It was done. The last thing was to feed them. His blood was the only choice, obviously, and so he used the same knife, heedless to the clay-soiled tip, to part his skin on the tip of his thumb. Seconds passed until blood welled into the cut, spilling silently. His mind still blank other than thought of his task, he pressed the wound onto the symbol on his son’s forehead. He felt pain then, almost a sucking sensation as the dry clay eagerly sought his fluids. It happened very quickly. A slight hum filled his ears, the sound of electricity perhaps, and he felt a thrumming under his hand, still pressed to his son. He lifted his hand quickly, and stepped back from the body, rigidly upright, eyes wide with shock. He had known it would work, prayed for it, and yet now he was chilled to the bone with fear. A finger curled. The cloth of the figure’s clothes shifted and settled. The sculptor moved nearer, clutching the knife tightly, breath rasping faster and faster, nostrils flared. An eye opened, the sound like one stone scratching across another. Another eye. The perfectly rendered eyes, complete except for colour (why hadn’t he thought to add colour?), turned and moved and rolled in their sockets. They found him suddenly, fixed on him, blinked slowly, and stared. The sculptor let out a cry, fell to his knees, and moaned his son’s name. The body sat up on the table, dried clay falling from it like leaves, as if they had been playing in an autumn garden. The mouth opened, and impossibly, almost silent, but not silent, it breathed. It reached to him, flexing its fingers, working them like it was trying on new gloves. It smacked its lips silently, discovering the configurations of its face, learning movement and sound and form, even as it shifted its bulk to the edge of the table. A further icicle of fear pierced the sculptor’s spine as the boy raised one hand and made a fist. Slowly, exerting utmost control, it extended one finger and pointed to him. daddy? came a scratching question. The body shifted nearer the edge of the table, until gravity took hold. With no knowledge of balance or of the mechanisms needed to stand, the body pitched helplessly onto the floor and lay; a soft mewling sound broke the stillness. The sculptor moved quickly to its side, all fear gone. He moaned the boy’s name over and over, convinced he would find the body hopelessly broken. But whatever magic had brought tragic life to his sculpture, it seemed also to have brought a physical sturdiness, for even as he reached the body, it was pushing itself into a sitting position, limbs and face and body intact. daddy it said again, confident this time, its voice still no more than a scraping whisper. The sculptor reached his hands to cup the boy’s cheeks, chilled anew at the pulsing warmth beneath the clay. He pushed the fear aside, closed his eyes and bent to plant a kiss on the boy’s forehead. If he had expected the kiss to land on soft, pliant skin, perfumed with fresh air and the exertion of play, then the reality could not have come as more of a shock. Gritty powder coated his lips, and he tasted the alkalinity of clay, the earthiness of the boy’s flesh. He moaned again. The boy moaned with him, a helpless wa wa wa wa wa and the sculptor ran his hands across the waving hair, so lifelike to touch, but smelling like the earth it was. He kissed him again, this time knowing the feeling and so relishing it. His son, born again. As he drew closer, folded his arms about the boy, the sounds he was issuing suddenly became clearer. wa wa w … .w… wh… wh why? why? why? why? why? The sculptor sat back, unable to think as the boy repeated his desperate question again and again. In all his planning, years and years of searching, never had he thought that this would be the first question the boy would ask. Tears streamed down his face, and as he reached out, the boy backed off, shedding dust and clay particles as he went, backing up, backing up until he reached a wall. He continued to push with his legs and in doing so, learned the mechanism of standing. The sculptor stood with him, and moved to stand in front of him, imploring the boy with eyes and gestures and words, to come to him, to let himself be held and to be a son again. The boy’s eyes flickered around the room, landing on the sculptor’s face, the table, the chairs, the window, the open door, the open door the open door the open door Before the sculptor could gather his wits, before he had chance to move, the boy pushed roughly past him, knocking him aside, and crashed through the open door, morning sunlight highlighting the contours of his exquisite face. The sculptor let out a shout of fear and confusion, but ultimately he was too late. The boy had gone. Time passed of which the sculptor had no recollection. The air seemed muted and grey, sounds muffled. Indeed solace could only be found in darkness and in such a state of drunkenness that he felt nothing but the burn of cheap wine. Even the hollow pain in his chest seemed diminished. For a time after his creation had fled, he had raged, hurling tools and lumps of sodden clay about the room, erasing any sign of his work, erasing any sign of the loss he had faced twice now. His son. His poor son. Panic fluttered constantly at the edge of his mind, his hands shook, and sounds issued from his ragged throat that bore no resemblance to human noises. What have I done? he cried to the room. My son! He began to piece together anything that might help him find the boy. He read and re-read Earth, Risen, hoping, desperately searching for some nugget he had missed. Where might he have gone? Who may have found him? And all this was affording the sculpture sentient thought. What if it was mindless, nothing more than animated clay? What if there was none of his son left? But the first word from its mouth had been daddy. Surely it must be his son. It must be. He took a drink of wine then, and one followed, and followed. Bottle after bottle was consumed, and the sculptor began to dream that none of it had happened. Darkness turned darker, sound failed him, and he lost his fight with sleep. But even sleep could not protect him from images of moving clay, great lumpen faces with stretched maws, grasping hands, tearing, pulling. And always the questions. why why why why why why why why why? He woke screaming. ‘… be aware of what you do. Wrath, like love, has to be earned. Be determined which one you truly seek. Because all is possible, and all is truth… ’ Was it love he wanted, truly? Or was he really seeking the boy’s wrath? He closed his eyes and saw the boy’s face, heard screaming, heard the breaking of glass and shrieking of tyres. He lived the moment that his son died, over and over. Died because of him. Because he took the boy from his mother in a drunken rage, drove in a drunken rage, killed his son in a drunken rage. He read the words again. In a second he knew. Knew everything. He knew somewhere in the back of his mind that he could never have lived with the sculpture like he would have his own son. And so love was not his aim here. That left only wrath, and as soon as he thought it, he felt a great weight lift. At last he felt the burden of his son’s death lift from his shoulders, and he knew where to find him. The door stood open still, flecks of clay marring the surface. It was a short walk to the bridge. The place where he had driven from the road, plunged the car into the icy river. To this day, he could not have said it was truly an accident or truly deliberate. But it happened, and as the black water flooded the car, and he struggled with his own seatbelt, he heard his son screaming and screaming. Until water smothered them both. He lived. His son did not, and now as he approached the small bridge, the replacement railing that his car had destroyed still a shade lighter than the original all these years on, he saw the figure sitting on the wooden boards. It had lost its clothes, and he saw again how unfinished its body was. A mere suggestion of form, and yet hands as perfect as in life covered a face that he knew better than his own. It sobbed as it sat there, whispers of pain and sadness reaching the sculptor’s ears. He bent to it and rested a hand on its shoulders. It reacted violently, snatching itself away, its mouth open in a silent scream, a suggestion of fear in its eyes. It locked gaze with him, and in a heart lifting moment, its mouth curled in a smile. Faint and stiff as the clay had dried but it was there. daddy it said. my son, he replied holding his arms out wide. It came to him then, and wrapped its arms around him. He sobbed and sobbed, tears dappling the dome of its head, running along the cleft of its parted hair. He dropped to his knees, knowing what was to come, and yet feeling nothing but the joy of finding his boy. He smiled and kissed the face lightly. He picked the boy up, rested his weight on the railings above the roiling water. It was as black as he remembered. Reaching a hand up to the creature’s forehead, he whispered two words onto its tiny ear. i’m sorry Its grip on him tightened and its eyes widened slightly as it realised somehow what he was about to do. He rested a thumb on its forehead, and with a scratching stroke, scraped out the first symbol drawn there. He remembered the text from Earth, Risen, remembered the symbols perfectly. In scratching out that first, he effectively turned truth, ΧΩη into death, Ωη The transformation happened quickly. Suddenly the sculpture was just that. In its eyes, there was nothing. He looked down into its face and saw not life there, but only the numerous faint marks of the tools that he had used to render it. The body was a dead weight, and its arms a hardened clay sculpture around his middle. As it dropped and he had neither the strength nor the desire to stop its fall, it took him with it. The water hit him with a slap of iciness, and he didn’t hesitate to finish what he had started. His first breath was air and foamy water and he coughed it out reflexively. His next, and the next, and the next, were not air. It was black freezing water he was filling his lungs with now, and he welcomed it. His son would have breathed the same water, would have felt the same panic, the pain in his chest that was fading remarkably quickly now he had resigned to it. As darkness came over him, he felt the clay sculpture begin to disintegrate in his hands. Faintly he felt the scrape of its hands as it released him into the water, and he reached with the last of his strength and wit to catch hold of its face. Clay crumbled under his touch, and he brought his hand back and kissed the residues. The action of the water gave the face a lopsided grin, one he remembered so well, and his tears added infinitesimal volume to the raging river. The pain was gone. His sight and hearing were gone. There was no feeling as the current tore him this way and that, scraped his trailing legs along the river bed, tore into his flesh with loose rock and branch. There was just the feeling of floating and the heart-bursting joy as a small hand took his and a whisper of love from a small voice echoed in his ear. He was content to lose his life for this; as if he had sculpted love from the very bones of despair and guilt. To have that hand in his, and those whispers of love and forgiveness in his ear. To have those, without life? It was enough. ",candidate00006
11,00002,candidate00006,"Sol bought the box from a local antique shop, on a rainy Saturday morning. He paid twenty-five pounds and thought he had got a real bargain. The dealer had shown him the box, marvelled at its intricate carved sides; the swirls and eddies of wood, some of them looking almost like faces, teased from the block by an obviously immensely talented woodworker. He ooh-ed and ahh-ed at the burnished brass corners and mother of pearl inlays, while Sol glanced from tables to chairs, from mirrors and broken picture frames to a particularly stained and unattractive watercolour, yawning. He bought the box because he though it was just the thing to sit his bedside lamp on. The dealer told him it was 18th Century. He wondered aloud at paying only twenty-five pounds for anything over 200 years old. The dealer shrugged and dropped the price to twenty. The traffic was snarled in the winding streets all the way back to his house, and it took more than twice the usual 15 minutes to drive from the centre of town. The rain continued to pour and steam built up on the insides of the car windows, until Sol was forced to wind down the window and drive with his head lolling out like a particularly wet and wretched dog. The box sat across the back seat, unperturbed by the visibility problems. By the time he reached his house, the rain had reached tropical ferocity. It seemed to bounce three feet off the pavement and as he rushed to the front door, key in hand, head bowed, a small river tore down his path, the debris of months of garden neglect collecting across his shoes. He opened the front door slower than he would have liked, key knocking the brass plate that covered the keyhole several times before finding the hole, and almost fell through the door in his haste. He wasn’t a man normally given to introspection, but his cheeks reddened slightly and he glanced over his shoulder in what he hoped was an easy movement, hoping no one had seen his panicked entrance. He pushed the door shut with his foot and leaned against it. It was then that he realised the box still sat on the passenger seat of his car, and that he hadn’t locked the doors. ‘Shit,’ he said. Then he laughed. Anyone willing to steal his car or the box in this weather was welcome to it. He kicked off his shoes, cursing the mess on the hall carpet. Rain fell from his clothes and hair and wet the carpet further, spotting a few pieces of post that had been dropped through the door while he was out. He picked them up, and although three out of the four were obviously junk mail, he shook them dry and placed them next to the telephone. ‘Shit’, he said again. He checked the answering machine for messages, listened to one from his mother and deleted it. He told the machine that he still wasn’t sure when he was going to get married and provide her a grandchild (or maybe two) but he wasn’t going to marry someone his mother had picked, and certainly not someone he was told about via his answering machine. He contemplated unplugging the phone, but decided against it and walked slowly to the kitchen. Putting the kettle on to boil, he grabbed a tea towel from the back of a chair and furiously dried his hair. Five minutes later, sitting in his living room, hair a tangled, damp mess, strong coffee in one hand and a piece of toast in the other, Sol finally relaxed. The rain seemed to slow with his heartbeat and he thought that he would leave the house to lock his car and bring in his recent purchase as soon as his coffee was drunk. He considered switching on his ancient radio, but was increasingly unimpressed by the banality it spat at him these days. He didn’t own a television. He wondered idly whether he was missing anything in his life. The thought remained unresolved. As he set his cup down on one of the old fake leather drink-mats his mother had bought him as a moving in present (the one and only time she had been to the house), the phone shrilled from the hall. He frowned, adopting that slightly paranoid air that comes over people when they hear a phone ringing. For Sol, nine times out of ten, a phone ringing was bad news. ‘Who..?’ he started, mentally counting off a list of the people who he expected it to be. His mother had already rung today. His list ended. The phone stopped abruptly. He picked up the receiver and dialled 1-4-7-1. The call was from a number he didn’t recognise. He frowned more deeply and hesitantly dialled the number. His frown smoothed as he listened and nodded. ‘Ah yes, I see, thanks very much for calling,’ he said as he hung up. It had been the antique dealer. Apparently there was a key for his box and the dealer had found it when cleaning the space the box had taken up in his shop. Sol resolved to drive down and pick it up right then before he had his lunch. The rain had left a clean stripe down the centre of the garden path, mini-drifts of sticks and flower heads left by the flood lining the path. The air had a damp yet optimistic feeling, the sun was warm and the smell of recent rain and wet foliage was one that Sol treasured in his garden. He breathed deeply, his step a little lighter. The traffic had eased and the sun shone fitfully through the remaining cloud cover. Sol had to keep his window open to clear the condensation that always built up inside his car when it rained. His spirits, somehow, were high. He pulled up outside the shop and pressed the switch that set his hazard lights flashing. He ran into the shop and after a frustrating five-minute conversation with the antique dealer, from which he tried numerous times to extract himself, he made it back to his car, key clutched tightly in his left hand, while he juggled his main set of keys with his other. Eventually he managed to grasp the car key and let himself back into the car. For the first time, he noticed the smell. It came from the box, he was sure of that, and he thought it must be the damp condition, bringing out the aroma of the wood. It was not an unpleasant smell, rather like deep green olives and coconut oil mixed with smoke and the dark musty smell of ripe earth. He turned and looked at the box, and saw for the first time how the grain of the wood seemed to glow in the patchy sunlight. He smiled to himself and breathed deeply. He threw the key lightly onto the seat beside him and it seemed to chime as it fell across the upholstery. Sol checked his mirrors and pulled sharply away from the shop. He made it home in ten minutes and after pushing the key deep into his pocket, carried the box carefully up the path, setting it down to rest on the toes of his shoes as he unlocked the front door. He set it down on the couch in his front room, and sat down on the chair opposite. He pulled the key from his pocket and turned it slowly in his hands, relishing the sound it made as it travelled through his calloused fingers, like a distant wind chime. He shut his eyes. Instantly images filled his head. Dark, rent flesh, a butcher’s shop of images with flashing, silver blades, spurting redness and screaming mouths stretched to impossible size in their terror. He thrust himself back against the chair. The key fell from his hand and he at once opened his eyes and emitted a low keening sound from deep in his throat. His eyes flashed wildly. ‘Jesus.’ he said, running a hand full-palmed across his face. He glanced down at the fallen key, gleaming dully in the thick pile of the carpet. A nervous chuckle sounded impossibly loud in the quiet of his house. He forced a laugh, anything to break the silence. The warmth, the quiet, the heaviness of toast and coffee that lay in his belly; he convinced himself it was these things, these normal everyday things that had lulled him into a mid-morning nap, and that his tired brain had concocted the awful nightmare images. He reached for the key, aware of the wind chime sounding in his ears again. He picked it up. The wind chime became a thousand chimes, a hundred thousand; all of them ringing in a wind that he could not feel. He shut his eyes, screwed his face in an attempt to shut out the noise. It was futile, for the sound doubled, then trebled, and he thrust his hands over his ears. The earthy, olive smell of the box wafted to him, and he opened his eyes to look. The box sat where he had left it. Around it, around him, the world had become a mess of nothingness, as if he lived in a watercolour painting and the artist had decided to wash everything out. His living room ran like it was liquid and behind the wallpaper and red brick and mortar was darkness. He moaned involuntarily, a dead sound, a helpless sound, as his world was washed from existence and all that was left was the box. Its dark wood gleamed malevolently, and Sol had presence of mind to question his thought then. It was a box. Boxes don’t do anything, let alone do them malevolently. He forced his hand open and the key fell once again to the carpet. It has left a red impression in his palm, which he stared at. ‘When I look up,’ he said to himself, his voice echoing and distant, ‘my living room will be back where it belongs.’ He looked. It was. And the box stood open. Strange sounds issued from it, distant keenings, howls that beat into the softness of his brain. He covered his ears against the noise, but it penetrated deeper. He stood, and stepped onto the key, which felt warm under his feet. For a fleeting moment he unstopped his ears to pick it up, and discovered that the sounds had ceased. Almost absent-mindedly, he retrieved the key and pocketed it, and turned his attention to the opened box. As he drew nearer, he theorised that the sounds had not stopped, but only that he had become used to them, and now they played a gently lapping tide across his anxiety. His eyes drew closed, dreamlike, and he smiled. His hand reached toward the box and fluttered like a bird in a wind. The noise from the box intensified and Sol opened his eyes to see a swirling mass begin to solidify on the dark interior of the box. The opening to the box itself seemed to have grown and the mass grew with it. He murmured some unintelligible word at the sight of it, and began to reach further inside the confines of the box. The mass grew darker, more real somehow, and flashes of gold light began to appear on the surface. Its shape was not firm however, switching from oval to sphere to star and every shape in between. The noises, now louder and clearly audible as voices (in choir, in jubilation, in terror?), beckoned him in, and even as he tried to thwart the box’s obvious intentions (he had long ago given up any thought to why or how the box was doing what it was doing), he fell forward into the yawning darkness, that impossibly, but absolutely, swallowed him. He had time and faculties enough to wonder at this situation he found himself in and then darkness overtook all. The noises did not abate however, and voices joined voices joined voices until the choir was gargantuan. He felt warm wetness on his cheeks and it could have been tears or blood. By degrees, light filtered into his consciousness and afforded him some knowledge of his surroundings, and allowed his mind to make some sense of things. It seemed he stood on wooden floorboards but it was only as he looked down to confirm this that he felt them under him. His feet were bare, and the slightest movement upon the floor broke open the skin on them, so that he shed tiny rivulets of scarlet onto the warped grain. There was no pain however. Somehow, he accepted all of this, and as he looked skyward (for the room in which he stood was so vast that the ceiling was out of sight completely) he accepted the presence of the seething mass that had drawn him here, swirling and knotting itself into a hundred thousand nightmare configurations. Only now it seemed to have shed the confines of the box into which he had fallen, and was of monstrous size, easily a hundred metres across, with clouds of gray and brown and black ebbing across its surface, held together one minute and the next thrown violently apart by shafts of golden lightning. The sum of this movement was nothing less than terrifying and as Sol stared into its depth, his pained and terrorised voice became one among many that was still the only sound here. As in a daze, he backed slowly away from the mass, but it was so large now that it was forever above him. He sat heavily, and felt the skin on his legs and buttocks splitting, but again there was no pain. A warm wetness spread across his thighs and he tore his gaze away from the sight above him to look. The mass gave off a light, but it was a sickly glow, turning everything in its scope a dirty gray. The stain on his jeans was black and he knew it was blood. He touched a finger to it. As his fevered mind allowed him to grasp at some invented logic to his present state, he began to smell the deep green olive and earth smell that had signalled the start of this episode. He imagined that he had fallen and hit his head on the rim of the box perhaps, and was dreaming this fugue state. The feeling of panic and loss was slowly leaving him, as the choir of voices did. A calm washed across him, such as he had never felt. He clutched his hands together and moved slowly in a circle to better assess his position. The swirling mass of energy above his head now occupied every horizon. He could still see the grey, grainy floorboards beneath his feet, but of ceiling and walls there was no sign. He had the impression that he could walk for a lifetime with the seething nightmare for a constant companion and never reach the room’s (if that is what he was in) extremes. The thought chilled him and elated him in equal measure. He thought he had been tricked into thinking that silence pervaded, for he began to hear cracklings and hissing sighs all around. They surely came from above him, the golden lightning flashes punctuating the sound until it achieved a measure of rhythm. He understood suddenly that they were the sounds of it growing. It struck him then how quickly he had shed the confines of rational thought. How long ago it seemed that he had drunk coffee and run through the rain. He shrugged off this sad and ultimately destructive train of though and began to walk. It seemed he walked for days. His feet bled, and on occasion when the pain became too intense he stopped and sat. The skin on his legs was healing, and no new blood had soaked his jeans. He was thankful for that. Always, the seething mass accompanied him, its roiling voice stopping Sol from thinking too hard about his situation. Then all sound ceased and the loss in his head was almost painful. ‘Hello,’ said a voice. Sol’s fear prevented him from anything but a barked reply. It seemed so long since he had heard any spoken word other than the cacophony of screams from above. He turned to face the speaker. A small creature stood there, more simian than human, but with a small upturned mouth, bristling with silver whiskers and a blue cap slung low over his brow that made him look like a fisherman. He wore dirty dungarees and with nothing on his feet, Sol could see that fur grew to the ends of his toes. A whip of a tail curled around one ankle, its end twitching. ‘Who are you?’ Sol managed at length. His voice was hoarse, and he wondered whether his voice had joined the thousands for his entire walk. ‘Danté,’ said the creature. He stood as if waiting on a reply, and when Sol gave none, he coughed and the whiptail switched ankles. Sol could have sworn he heard its passage through the hot air, even above the noise. ‘Wanna get you away from that,’ the creature said, motioning upwards with a tilt of its head. ‘Never seen it so big.’ He beckoned and ran in the opposite direction, his gait light and altogether non-human. Sol figured he had no choice but to follow. ‘It’s not for you, y’see,’ Danté shouted over his shoulder as they ran. Sol kept pace, just, and soon felt his lungs burning. He ignored the cryptic comment, concentrated on matching the creature’s speed. Soon they came to a door set into one wall. Sol had not seen it coming, and indeed, it only seemed to waver into existence once Danté came close to it. ‘It’s protected by a shimmer,’ he explained. ‘Keeps me from going up there. Without it, you’d never find home, and run forever in this place.’ Sol noticed the creature never looked at the mass, which was still in every corner of his vision. Golden rods of lightning suddenly arced downwards, striking the floor and leaving scorched debris in its wake. Sol was sure that it had struck where they had been standing. He shuddered and followed the creature through the door. It slammed behind him, and as he heard and felt the shimmer hide them from existence, so he felt the pull and the noise of the mass disappear. A sickly feeling doubled him over, and he squeezed his eyes shut against it. He rubbed his ears and his eyes, unwilling to open them and admit to anything that he saw here. ‘We call it the Wrath,’ Danté explained. ‘We?’ asked Sol. ‘We. As in us. As in the guards of this place. Guards o’ the Wrath.’ It made no sense to Sol, even as a dream. He shook his head. ‘What do you guard? That thing?’ he gestured to the door. ‘God, no. The Wrath does at it pleases. As he pleases.’ He didn’t furnish Sol with a name. ‘We guard this place for when people like you come here. Wrong people, innocent people.’ His tone had taken on a dark edge, and Sol went cold at the word innocent. Was something about to happen? Something more? Something that shouldn’t happen to him, but that would happen because he was innocent and had no way of stopping it? ‘Don’t worry,’ Danté quickly said. ‘You’ll be okay now ole Danté’s got you. What is your name, anyway?’ ‘Sol.’ ‘Solomon?’ the creature asked. ‘Solomon and Danté!’ He nodded his approval, but Sol wasn’t sure of what he approved. ‘Just Sol.’ Danté raised his hands as if in supplication, and wrapped his tail a little tighter around his ankle. ‘Okay, okay. No offence meant.’ ‘Sorry,’ said Sol. ‘It’s just that…’ He let the sentence trail. ‘I know, I know. The Wrath can do that to an innocent.’ ‘What in hell is it?’ Sol asked, softening to this creature. ‘Exactly that. Hell. Or at least his representation of it. I don’t suppose Hell as such exists anymore, what with the state of things Earthly. There’d be no separating it, eh?’ He laughed at his little joke. Sol remained quiet. ‘Anyway, it is a magnet, if you like, for all of,’ at this he gestured upwards, ‘you know. You lot. Wrongdoers, evil-bringers, death-deliverers. What I like to call Society. There’s a few innocents, like you, that don’t belong here, never will, but for most, this is it.’ ‘Who is he?’ Sol asked. ‘All in good time, all in good time. Fancy a drink?’ ‘I’m not sure I understand all this. I was just…I…can’t remember what I was doing before this, actually. I don’t understand.’ Sol looked round for a chair, and finding none, bent and sat cross-legged on the floor. Danté joined him, although he had considerably less far to bend. The creature huffed. ‘Look, it’s like this.’ Absurdly, he found himself settling to listen. ‘Society sins. It’s the way it is. Year on year, decade upon decade, Society will find new and unimaginably unpleasant ways to commit sin. Now don’t get me wrong. I’m no judgement. God knows, I sin as much as the rest, but things are…different down here. Nowhere for us to go, you see? We’re here no matter what. And Society’s sinners? They come here. The Wrath takes ‘em.’ Sol swallowed and the click was audible. ‘Here, let me get you that drink.’ The creature stood and hopped lightly to a cabinet set deep into one corner, bringing two cups and a dark green fermenting brew that smelled to Sol like the bottom of a compost heap. He drank however, still content that he was dreaming all this. The brew was, if nothing else, palatable, and he smiled. ‘Thanks.’ ‘I know all this is hard, but we need to get you back up there before she decides she can’t wait no longer.’ ‘She?’ asked Sol. ‘Sorry,’ the creature blushed. ‘We reckon the Wrath is female. Don’t know why.’ ‘Wrath. Of course.’ Sol said, laughing softly. He sipped more of the green brew that, against his better judgement, was beginning to taste quite pleasant. ‘Go on.’ ‘Anyway, she collects things. We all collect things, don’t we, but she likes to collect people. Souls, if you like.’ ‘Sinners,’ Sol interrupted. ‘Now you’re getting it!’ Danté smiled. ‘Exactly. Sinners.’ ‘So where do I fit into all this?’ Sol asked. ‘I haven’t sinned, not like she thinks.’ Something else was bothering Sol, as if the current situation wasn’t worrisome enough. ‘I know loads of people who you’d call sinners. Adulterers, thieves. All that.’ ‘You mix with some nice people, Sol, I must say.’ ‘Well, I don’t know them as such, but my point is, I know of them. Why are they not here? And speaking of which, where are all these sinners? What does she do with them?’ Danté looked to the floor. ‘Here’s the thing, Sol. For people to be collected, they have to be..er..’ He paused. ‘Don’t tell me. Dead.’ ‘Yes. Dead. Then their souls have two paths. One is here. You can imagine the other. Anyway, what I am trying to tell you is that for you to be brought here, you will have to have died up there.’ He used his tail to gesture upwards, its whistling tip close to Sol’s face. ‘Did you?’ ‘How the hell should I know?’ Sol shouted. He began to stand, but something in Danté’s eyes stayed his movement. ‘Keep your voice down! The shimmer is only good for so long. We do not want her to find us down here. Are you sure you didn’t die up there?’ The questioning seemed so ludicrous that Sol found himself answering without thinking. ‘I don’t think so. I remember buying a chest, a box for my bedside lamp. Then I remember opening it, I remember falling towards it, and then. Nothing.’ ‘Right.’ ‘Right what?’ ‘Just right.’ ‘What the Hell’s that supposed to mean?’ ‘Shh, I’m thinking. I suppose that….’ Danté stopped and ran a clawed hand across his stiff whiskers. ‘There are portals here, portals to and from this place. Only we know of them, and usually, only we use them.’ ‘You’ve been up?’ Sol pointed towards the ceiling. ‘Once. Awful place. Anyway, I suppose you may have fallen into one. She does set them in the strangest places. They are to capture those she considers the foulest of the foul. Some that she cannot wait for.’ ‘So why me? And how did I manage to get here without….her finding me? ‘Well, it could be that she didn’t know you were here. What happened, exactly, with your box?’ ‘It opened and I fell in. I heard voices, I remember that, and I had a key.’ He felt in his pocket and the key was still there. He said so. ‘Seems important to keep hold of that, I reckon,’ said Danté. ‘Anyway, you got in through a portal, and we need to get you out. He may be looking for you now.’ ‘I thought you said it was female?’ ‘The Wrath is female. Him who owns it is a man. Or was a man once. Something like that. Although as time goes on, I don’t know who owns who anymore.’ ‘So he is the Devil or something?’ Danté laughed. ‘You humans, always so quick to put a name to something. He’s not the Devil or anything like it. He’s gone past being anything like that. More like he’s just a rumour now. Whatever the case, she is his pet, you could say. I don’t reckon he’s had a hand in her existence for as long as I’ve been here, at least.’ ‘Then why did you mention him, why did you say ‘the Wrath does as he pleases’ then?’ ‘Habit, I guess. No, the truth is that I don’t know where or who he is. He was human once, they say. They also say that he raised a demon and that the demon took his mortal life in exchange for an immortal one. The only catch being, that existence was down here.’ He gestured towards the door. ‘What a deal, eh? No one knows when he created the Wrath, but they say..’ ‘Hang on a minute,’ Sol interrupted. ‘Who is ‘they’?’ ‘You know. Just they.’ Danté said. Sol nodded, and indicated he was ready for the rest. ‘Anyway, ‘they’ say that the Wrath was created by this immortal man as a way of placating the demon and getting his mortal life back. If he collected enough damned souls, then he reasoned that the demon would give him his life back, and exchange places again. Hasn’t happened yet, as you can see. And hear.’ He pricked his ears towards the ceiling. ‘She’s getting louder, Sol. She must know you are here somewhere. The shimmer is holding her for now. We are safe for a while longer.’ ‘And then?’ Sol asked. Danté shrugged. ‘We run.’ Sol could hear the Wrath now as she roiled and crackled above them. He imagined the dark clouds and golden lightning and configurations that he now knew were the sounds of the Wrath growing. Soon it would not matter that he was no sinner; it would not matter that a shimmer protected them or that Danté was here. Soon enough, the Wrath would get him and he could not be able to escape her. ‘How do we beat her, then?’ he asked. ‘We don’t. We run and we run and we find your portal.’ The first few steps of their escape were easy and quiet, for the Wrath seemed, inexplicably, to have grown quiet during their last words together. Sol began to wonder (he had long ago stopped wondering if he was dreaming) whether he would be safely back home before long. Then a huge, deafening scream filled the void of sound, as if a million insects had made whatever squealing, chitinous, wrenching sounds they make. Sol felt a hot breath on his back as the Wrath turned her murderous attention to them once more, and they were flung off their feet, landing hard on the cracked wooden floor. Sol was momentarily stunned, and he felt a small, clawed hand grasping at his arm. ‘Come on, come on!’ a voice screamed, and he turned to see Danté inches from his face, panic in his eyes, spittle spraying from his whiskered jaws. His lips trembled like those of a jilted lover. They ran. They had to start the journey running in the opposite direction to the one that had brought Sol to Danté’s house. The Wrath now covered every line of sight back the way Sol would have ordinarily gone. He hoped that whatever skewed and deranged physics affected this place, he could find his way back in any direction, as if he were running on a tiny globe. Jags of bitter lightning forked down to meet them, crashing and sparking blue fire off the floor all around them. Danté squealed and leaped high into the air at every crash, and Sol concentrated on pounding his footsteps as hard and as fast as he could. There was no time for conversation, and each knew that to pause would be to die. Sol blessed the green brew that Danté had given him, for far from being tired, he was filled with a strange energy that lit his eyes and turned his feet over and over without effort. He felt almost as if he couldn’t stop even if he had wanted to. Despite this, and despite Danté’s almost constant encouragement, he could feel the heat and the anger of the Wrath gaining on them. He began to whimper, under his breath at first and then louder. ‘…run…run…RUN…RUN….RUNRUNRUNRUNRUN!’ Footsteps pounded in his ears. He tried to fathom their distance as they ran, but the deafening strikes of lightning and bitter ozone that they left beghind soon clouded his mind to anything but running. Suddenly Danté grabbed his hand and pulled him in an almost sickening twist to the left, and his stomach turned and roiled as they passed through another shimmer. He looked around him, almost unable to believe his eyes. A cup, remnants of green fluid stickly coating the rim, sat just where he had left it. ‘But..’he gasped. ‘We’re back. We have just run in a circle!’ The creature seemed unable to breathe. His cheeks were flushed red, and droplets of sweat dripped and splashed off his whiskers. His tail, no longer taut and whip-like, hung softly on the floor, flailing weakly. He shook his head slowly. ‘No. We’re not. It’s another shimmer,’ he explained through gasps of air, stale but infinitely fresher than the ozone-filled atmosphere on the other side of the door. ‘Different location, same destination. We have come far, believe me. I have shimmers all over this place, all leading here.’ Sol sat down hard. ‘Jesus, I’m going mad. It’s the only explanation,’ he said, wiping his forehead with his palm running his hand down the whole of his face. A sharp stinging slap to his cheek drew a loud cry from him. ‘What the hell was that for?’ ‘You are not mad, Sol. This is reality. I will NOT have you put all this down to your madness. I will NOT fail you but I must have complete faith from you. You must believe in this or it will not work. Do you understand me?’ Danté was back to his jittery, rodent-like self, tail twitching, whiskers twitching, fisherman’s cap once more pulled down tight. Sol laughed. He shook his head. ‘Whatever you say, cap’n.’ ‘What kind of answer is that?’ ‘The only one I can give right now, I think. It will have to do.’ ‘So it will, so it will,’ said Danté. ‘So all the shimmers lead here?’ Sol asked. ‘All of mine do, yes. There are thousands all over this place, but all mine lead here. You just have to know which are yours and which aren’t. It gets quite simple, really it does. You always know which house is yours on your street? Which car is yours in the car park? It’s the same here for me. My shimmers are mine and I know them and love them like you love your possessions. Apart from what you see here,’ he paused to sweep around the contents of his room, ‘they are all I’ve got. Think of them as…as stepping stones to wherever you want to go. Trouble is, we could open that door twenty times and be back where we started each time. They don’t work quite so well any more. With any luck we can be a way away next time we open that door. Now up you get, Sol. We need to move, ‘cause you can bet your life she knows we are here and she won’t stop looking.’ Noticing Sol’s downbeat eyes, hitching breath and trembling hands, Danté cheered. ‘Come on! What else would you be doing?’ Sol fixed him with a glance that would have been comical under any other circumstances. Under these, with the Wrath beating and swelling like a gargantuan poison-sac of souls, it wasn’t. He stood and they faced the door. ‘Now, when I say run, you run. Out of the door, and immediately left. Run for your life.’ Danté’s cheery demeanour left him and he hissed the words, tail twitching like a whip about its deadly business. In the end he had to say nothing, for no sooner than the door handle was turned, than Sol was out of it, feet barely touching the floor. Danté followed, slamming the tiny door behind him. It was as if the Wrath was lying in wait. They were instantly pursued, and the giant writhing mass was so close they could smell its bitter, cordite-laced aroma. Sol turned and looked directly into the mass, saw once and for all what the shifting patterns of grey and black on its surface really were. They were faces, hideously stretched and howling madness at him, faces of the people that the Wrath had snatched from life and collected in this cloud. They came and went so fast that the impression was of one single face, deformed and turned inhuman with the horror of it, the horror of their situation. That they had some comprehension, Sol was sure. It turned his bowels to water to watch and he tore his gaze away. Danté had gained some distance from him and his heart quickened. He raced harder to catch up. All the while the Wrath screeched and clattered at him, and now the noise was made all the more desperate, for among the scratching and crackling of the lightning that still struck the floor all about him, he could hear single voices, single words and though all were different, all were the same. Help….me…horror…fear…destroy…me Sol reached out and clasped a hand on Danté’s shoulder. He could feel wiry muscle barely covering tiny bones and a heat that was like fever. He suddenly felt exhilarated beyond anything he had ever felt, and he screeched loudly into the air. It fell silent, such was the clamour that came from the abomination behind him. He concentrated on following Danté’s stamping feet and athlete’s rhythm. When it happened, it happened so quickly that he barely had time to register. Danté turned and shouted something to Sol. Over the noise and heated fear of the Wrath, Sol heard nothing more than muted sounds, snatches of words that were swallowed instantly. ‘Here…must find…shimmer…SOL!’ He heard this last word as Danté turned abruptly, his small hairy hands reaching for Sol’s. Sol reached back, and would have caught them had it not been for a flash of lightning that exploded not five feet to his right. He flinched automatically, and his hands missed their mark. Sickeningly, he saw Danté turn an invisible door handle, and even as Sol slowed and tried to make the turn, the guard disappeared through the door. He saw a flash of shimmering air, like a heat haze and then nothing. For a second he paused, unbelieving. Stupidly he reached a hand into the darkness. Another lightning flash to his right, this one close enough to singe his clothing, snapped him from his daze. Pain flared in his right leg, heat and cold fear mingling through the very marrow of his bones. He ran on, blood leaking slowly from a wound he did not want to see, knowing that to keep going would lose him his escape, but that to stop would lose him his life. He shouted and screamed and clenched his fists tight against his ears. Tears coursed down his cheeks, and a wild look appeared in his eyes. Always, the Wrath bore down on him, its immense size beyond description now. He may as well have tried to outrun the world. He could feel it pulling on him, snatching at him with its unending and relentless army of souls. It thrust images into his head, images that mirrored the flickering blood and death visions he had had so long ago in his living room. He barked a sob, clutched his stomach, so deep did his feeling of loss and pain go. He glanced round wildly now, searching for any sign of Danté, of a door, of anything. There was nothing to see but vast expanses of wooden floorboards, struck black here and there with lightning strikes. He risked one more look over his shoulder, and at the sight of the Wrath, all hate and fear and writhing faces, he screamed. There seemed there was no choice but to run and run and run and wait for the thing, which seemed to have started it’s knotting and un-knotting anew, to take him. So he ran. Days passed, or seemed to. Sometimes the Wrath was distant, like some vast fireball bearing down on him, constant and yet far enough away so as to feel no heat from it. Other times it seemed as though the thing was on him, in him. He could feel the raw energy crackling his hair off his arms; feel the electricity jolt through his teeth, light his eyes with eldritch fire. As he ran, he began to notice more and more of the blackened spots on the floor. He knew they should mean something to him, but the noise and pain of the Wrath prevented him from thinking for more than a few seconds at a time. Then he saw a splash of blood, dried to a crust. He saw a small, clawed footprint in the blood, and more leading from it. More lightning struck the floor, sending bright sparks of blue and gold spiralling into the air. He increased his speed as much as he could, (how, he could never explain) and the noise from the Wrath lessened blessedly for one vital minute. His head emptied and thoughts locked into place like the tumblers of a lock. Suddenly he knew what he had seen. Blackened spots where lightning had struck. But ahead of him. Blood, his blood he was sure, ahead of him. It all meant that he had been past this spot before. And if the blood was from the wound he had received just after Danté had left him, then..? The door Danté had left though must be just…. He was wrenched violently to the side as Danté’s powerful hands grabbed him. They scrabbled and clattered against his skin, tearing it, scratching deep gouges into his arms. His panic, constant since he could remember, further heightened as he thought of running on his own again through this devil’s wasteland. In blind terror, he threw himself towards his saviour, badly twisting a knee as he did so. He thrust his arms out, grasping with his own hands. Mercifully they closed on cloth, and then he saw the leathery end of Danté’s whip-like tail close round his wrist. He saw the glistening heat haze and felt the now familiar sickness as he was pulled through the shimmer and landed hard on the floor of Danté’s room. He was sick, copiously and violently, and through it all he could hear the Wrath screaming in frustration. The voices joined in one long low churning moan. The protection of the shimmer could do nothing to lessen the noise now, and Danté threw a chair against it, followed that with a table and more chairs until there was a small mountain of woodwork piled there. He turned away from the mess on the floor and closed his eyes. He let his mind sink from white to grey to black, wallowing in the relief of unconsciousness. He awoke sometime later to the smell and spitting sizzle of frying bacon. The experience was so alien in this setting that he sat bolt upright, sure he had had a nightmare. His stomach rolled when he saw the pile of furniture by the door, heard, above the cooking sounds, the dreadfully familiar sound of the Wrath crackling in hideous parody of the frying pan that Danté was filling now with giant mushrooms. ‘Thought you might want some food,’ he said, conversationally, as if his life had not just been seconds from its end. ‘That was close, Sol. Very close. Good thing you found your way back to this shimmer. Top marks, my friend!’ ‘Believe me,’ Sol croaked. ‘It was not planned. How long have I been out, anyway?’ He rubbed his leg, which had developed a worrying throb, on one side from the searing lightning bolt, on the other with the deep ache of his sprained knee. ‘Not long. An hour, maybe.’ ‘Did…it…ever leave?’ he asked. ‘No. Didn’t get worse, mind. Just kind of sat there as if it was waiting. Never known it to do that before. Hmm… ’ Sol tried to stand, and immediately his weakened leg betrayed him and he fell with a sharp cry. ‘Now then, Sol, that leg’ll not get better like that. Here, sit.’ Danté brought the single chair that did not make up the mountain at the door and Sol slumped gratefully into it. It felt good to sit. A mounded plate of steaming mushrooms, crisp bacon and soft hot bread was dumped on his lap. He ate greedily, washing the lot down with huge mouthfuls of sweet creamy milk. A cup of the green brew ended the meal and he sat back, the pain in his leg, for the moment, gone. ‘Thanks, Danté. For everything,’ he said. ‘Don’t thank me yet. You’re not home yet.’ ‘Speaking of which,’ Sol said, ‘we run again?’ ‘We do. But not that way.’ He gestured to the door. Sol looked around him, eager to spot another secret exit, but found none. ‘Where…’ he began. Danté moved to the centre of the room and bent to the floor. A quick flick of one tiny finger against a knot in the wood revealed a hidden catch. He pulled this and Sol heard a rolling clunk, as if a huge key had been turned. A square portion of the floor to the side of the room rose by about three inches and revolved, revealing a dark passage that led downwards on stone steps seemingly cut into whatever passed for bedrock in this place. Sol raised his eyebrows. ‘And how am I supposed to fit in there?’ Their escape was a tiny trapdoor, no more than eighteen inches across and about nine wide. Danté waved his hand dismissively. ‘You’ll see. And besides, this might be our only way. She’s waiting, y’see. Can you still hear her?’ Sol admitted that he could, all the while. A hissing, groaning, crackling rumble, as if the thing had settled in to wait, and would not move until it had him in her grasp. He shuddered. ‘This may be the only way, Sol.’ Danté moved quickly to a set of drawers set deep into the walls of his room. Out of the top drawer, he pulled a long rolled up piece of paper, which he hurriedly set down on an empty space of floor and unrolled. He motioned Sol impatiently to hold down the loose end, which he did, a quizzical look beginning to appear on his face. His heart quickened as he saw Danté’s plan unfurling. ‘A map?’ he asked. ‘My map. Of all my shimmers’ locations.’ ‘So we can jump from here to anyone of these?’ he asked. He had left his chair, the pain in his leg momentarily forgotten, or gone, and squatted next to Danté. ‘And back again. That’s the idea. Remember, though, as I said. It’s not always that simple.’ The map looked like the mad workings of some insane mathematician. Swirls and circles with numbers and strange hieroglyphs marked inside them, that Sol took be shimmer locations, were crossed and crossed again, back and forth, with lines of scratched pen interlacing the whole so that it resembled a mad web of unending complexity. Across it all were more markings, words, numbers, blots of ink and smudges. The guard was tapping a claw on the map, at a point where the lines of intersection seemed to meet. Indeed, as Sol rose to get a better look, he saw more clearly. There was a definite centre to the chaos. ‘Home.’ ‘Just how many shimmers are there?’ Sol asked. ‘Thousands and thousands across the whole. I’ve never counted them all. I have…’ he seemed to count in his head, ‘two hundred and twelve, I think. New ones crop up from time to time. Doesn’t happen much any more, though.’ ‘Wow,’ was all Sol could say. Danté looked at him approvingly. ‘Indeed.’ The light in Danté’s room had dimmed. The candles that he lit were smelly, smoky things that spat grey wax onto everything within about three feet of them. Sol kept his distance. Danté was crouched over the map, pouring over it like some pirate, desperate to find a treasure. ‘Now,’ he said, ‘the easy part is the…er…going. The hard thing will be to decide exactly where to go to.’ The muted screeching from outside the door had intensified in the last few minutes. Sol could feel the hair on his arms prickling in the static atmosphere that was building up. ‘I think we had better make that decision sooner rather than later.’ Danté just looked at him. Without looking down at the map, he asked, ‘Now, where did you come in? Anything you remember? Anything at all?’ ‘Nothing. Grey floorboards. Come to think about it, the floorboards here are all brown, aren’t they? Does that help?’ ‘My boy, it helps! It helps!’ the guard cried. ‘You arrived at the Fifth station. All grey. Only place that is. Someone is on our side, I tell you!’ Sol looked confused. ‘This place is divided into stations. Areas, with exits and entrances to them. Only one is grey. The biggest, the grey one. The Fifth. Makes sense really. You arrive at the biggest station, because most doors lead there. Why didn’t I think!’ He began to beat his forehead quite alarmingly. Sol started to move toward him when he continued. ‘Only trouble is, there is only one shimmer that leads back there. We have to go, now. No time to lose, Sol.’ He headed to the trapdoor when Sol grabbed his arm and spun him on his heels. ‘I thought we had to go out there?’ he asked a little wildly, pointing at the barricaded door. ‘Ah, I told you that, didn’t I? Normally yes, but I have one other exit. Down there.’ He pointed down the rough-hewn steps that disappeared from the trapdoor. ‘But I’ll never fit…’ Sol started. ‘It has a way of….accommodating people,’ Danté explained. ‘You’ll see.’ They approached the trapdoor, and as Danté put his feet on the first step, Sol was sure he could hear the Wrath intensify its screams. His teeth began to ache, and he urged the guard on. The guard vanished down the steps. Sol reached one leg to the first step and as he did so, was aware of a sensation not unlike floating in water. He steadied himself on the edge of the nearby table, and then he was on the second step, then the third. He turned to look at the room one last time and was amazed to find that the edge of the trapdoor was level with his waist. How he would never know, but he was descending the steps through a trapdoor barely big enough to fit a child. It accommodates he thought. Whether that meant it grew, or he shrank he had no idea. And had no wish to know. He closed his eyes and descended. Danté was waiting at the foot of the staircase. A fluttering torch in his small hand lit the way about five feet in front of them, no more. ‘Come on,’ he said. ‘Not far. It’s not far.’ The door appeared in front of them as Danté neared it. It hazed into view behind the thickest shimmer Sol had yet seen. It looked blurred and out of shape. The guard grasped the handle and quickly opened it. They looked out on an expanse of dirty brown floorboards. Danté’s head dropped, and Sol’s heart with it. This wasn’t the fifth station. It was obvious. The Wrath hummed and buzzed like a millions rain drenched pylons. Sol looked up as the guard slammed the door hard. He seemed to be murmuring something, a prayer, and curse, Sol wasn’t sure. He opened the door again after the murmuring ceased. ‘YES!’ shouted Danté. The grey floorboards of the Fifth stretched away from them through the doorway. Sol felt some of his jubilation, but also felt the pull of the Wrath and knew it was near. Hell, it was everywhere. Sol hoped that it had a focus, a point that was forward and a point that was backward, and if so, the back was what they could see now. He shuddered with a fresh fear at the sight. It was everywhere, this thing. No longer gold and grey and blue flashes, the Wrath had turned black at its centre. Lightning arced down from it every few meters and the floor was scorched and blackened. It was as big as a world. A smell of burning wood and (flesh?) filled the air. Sol fought to keep his lunch down. ‘We have to go, Sol. Have to find your box!’ shouted Danté, raising his voice loud enough to be heard. They ran through the smoke and the heat haze that permeated the air. Ran towards the Wrath. Sol felt his breath catch in his throat, felt the hairs on the back of his arms fizz and crackle. He resolutely followed Danté as he weaved and ducked past lightning strikes. The going became more and more treacherous the nearer they got to the Wrath. Having run from it for so long, it seemed ludicrous to be running towards it. Now that they were near, Sol realised that they had never been near the thing. Not really. It was gargantuan, and now nothing of their environment showed past its bulk except the floor. Sol focused all his energies on the pattern of his feet, trusting to the guards unerring sense of direction. When he first thought he saw the box, standing on the floorboards like some discarded attic furniture, he almost ignored it, so channelled were his thoughts. He had almost left the reason for their flight behind him. A sharp tug on his arm brought him around and when he saw Danté pointing and pulling him round, his heart quickened and he followed. He sped up, if it were at all possible, and drew level with Danté. There was no doubt. The box stood before them, perhaps a hundred metres or so away. The lid was shut, and even through the gloom, Sol could see the grain gleaming dully. ‘How did you know where to find it?’ he shouted at Danté. The guard shrugged and grinned a huge whiskery grin. Sol clapped him on the shoulder. As Sol turned to look over his shoulder, to look one last time at the seething mass of stretched faces that made up the Wrath’s bulk, he saw the damaged floorboards a second too late. He felt his foot come down on floorboards that were splintered and cracked. He bare feet were lanced with pain as splinters drove themselves deep into the flesh there. He screamed. He was the luckier of the two. Danté stumbled on the broken floor. His feet were less than half the size of Sol’s, and where the man’s bridged the splintered holes, the guard’s pushed through the gap, hard. Even over the hiss and writhing hatred of the Wrath, Sol heard the snap of bone as clear as if the world had been in silence. Danté yelped and tumbled from Sol’s peripheral vision. He turned, unable to stop running now, and saw Danté mouthing at him. go go go GO GOGOGO! He stopped and watched in helpless horror as a fresh arc of lightning, slower than the rest and soot black inside, pierced the gloom and lit upon the guard’s upturned face. There was a moment of clarity in his eyes, of peace, and then all was hell. Danté’s features were stretched beyond reason, his body blackening and withering in the lightning’s grasp. Smoke rose from his curled form, and as his body burned, sickeningly, the noise from the Wrath abruptly ceased. All Sol was left with was the tortured screams of his new friend. He ran someway back toward him, and caught a look of pleading in his eyes. The look stopped him cold. There was a flash of light, and a renewed burning smell and Danté was gone. The Wrath began its chitinous, scrabbling frenzy afresh, and added to the mix now was just one more voice among innumerable others. He had lost his friend, and hatred boiled in Sol. He raised his fists, uselessly of course, at the mass, cursing the very day he had stumbled into the antique shop. He turned and ran, tears blurring his eyes, vowing to succeed where Danté had not. Twenty steps (he counted them all as a way of shutting his mind from the recent horror) brought him within six feet of the box. The dull woody gleam of its sides cut through the gloom, and he heard the choir of voices that had so enraptured him. The sound of the Wrath became even more intense as if to shut the choir out. Sol slowed his run and approached the box at a walk. He ran his hand over the closed lid, shut his eyes, and for a moment he could feel soft carpet under his feet, hear the blare and hum of distant traffic, taste the remnants of stale coffee on his tongue. He opened his eyes suddenly, sure that he would be home. But no. A haze around the box showed colours, patterns that Sol recognised as his wallpaper, but that faded almost instantly, so quickly in fact that he convinced himself that he had imagined it. He placed his hands again on the box. This time he left his eyes open, and there, around the box like a fuzzy halo, he saw his world trying to creep through the tattered edges of reality. It was there! He knew it. All he had to do was open the box and… The key! His fished desperately in his pockets, searching for the cold, hard chunk of metal that had brought him to this world of pain. A low moan escaped him as his hands found nothing. As if aware of his despair, the Wrath screamed louder than ever before, and did Sol hear mocking laughter in that noise? Surely not, but he turned wildly, and was quick enough, with a second to spare, to dodge a vicious lightning strike that lit down in front of the box, its eldritch light creeping around the base of the box like a living thing, a swamp mist. The sound of its strike was deafening and Sol screamed again. His throat burned and his eyes stung from the screaming and crying he had done here. Thick tarry smoke rose from the floorboards beneath him, and he turned away. He had to find the key, and as wrenching as it was to do, he ran a hand across the box, closed his eyes, offered a small prayer for Danté, and ran. He felt no fear, as if all his fear has drained from him now that he knew the box was his. He quickened his pace, seeing his route in his mind’s eye, never wishing to see the Wrath again. He knew he could run forever in this place blinded and never falter. It was just too vast. He matched his reverse route, had he but known, almost exactly. He envisaged leaving the relative safety of Danté’s room, and felt a strange pull. Open your eyes, he urged himself. Not yet. Not yet, just a few more feet ‘NOW!’ he screamed, shocking and emboldening himself in equal measure. His eyes flew open just in time to see a faint heat haze, the merest outline of a door. He reached for it, squeezed his eyes shut once more and formed a tight fist in the air. He felt cold metal in his hand and as he turned it, heard the faint snick of a door opening. His heart leapt and he copied it, literally hurling himself at the opening in space. He fell hard through the shimmer and landed with a breath-taking thud. The door slammed shut behind him. He was back in the guard’s room. Without the energetic, ever-moving guard here, the place appeared drab, as if in his dying, Danté had robbed the place of its own life. Sol mourned him quietly. He found a measure of the green brew and raised the battered cup high. He drank, letting the energy given drink wash through him. ‘You were a good friend, old guard,’ he said to no one. ‘A good friend.’ He downed the remainder of his drink and set the cup down. He looked around at the room, subtly altered and yet the same as the last time they had been there. Danté’s absence, he thought. He stared at the room hard. Tried to spot anything that seemed different to the last time he had been here. Anywhere that he may have left the key. Not on the chair, the table, not… He remembered suddenly plummeting into the room, falling hard on the floor and passing out. He dropped to his knees quickly, scoured the worn, bare floor for anything…and there! Trapped between two floorboards, a dull gleaming key. His key. He reached for it, scrabbling his fingers in the groove between two boards until the key shifted and came loose. A fingernail tore painfully, leaving a raw wet crescent that beaded blood. He let it come, let the stab of icy pain clear his mind of the torments. The blood dripped to the floor and he pressed it into the grainy boards, ceremoniously. ‘I’ll get out of here, Danté, if just for you. I will.’ He retrieved the key and stood facing the door. He remembered the guard’s warning that the door didn’t always open on the right place, and he remembered the trapdoor that had taken them to the Fifth. Somehow he knew it wouldn’t function without its owner, so it must be the door. He tried to envisage the station, the grey floorboards, and settled on an image of his box, before all this madness, standing on his living room carpet, glowing with a woody warmth. ‘OK, shimmer,’ he said, alarmed at the croak in his voice. ‘I’ve had about all the shitty luck I can stand. Just take me to the box.’ He had no idea if this was how Danté found his way around, but it seemed right. He only hoped it would succeed first time. Despite the drink, he had neither the energy nor the inclination to do this again. In the end, he needn’t have worried. A soon as he opened the door, he knew he had it right. He stole one last look at the room, and the smudged thumbprint of blood on the floor, the still drying smear on the edge of his cup. ‘Bye, Danté,’ he whispered and shut the door forever. The Fifth station was changed. The Wrath seemed to falling apart. It had lost none of its size, but jagged motes of dirty grey ash were falling everywhere, like hellish snow, like the aftermath of a volcano. Ozone and smoke pricked his nostrils and he walked calmly towards the box in the distance. The Wrath sent down lightning strikes all around him, but it was as if the key was some kind of talisman, protecting him from danger. The Wrath seemed to sense this and doubled its attack. Sol looked at the mass, smiling, and saw the damage it was causing itself in its anger. Great chunks of it were falling away, and falling as ashen clouds. Most had disintegrated by the time they hit the floor. Faces pulled and stretched away from the thing, (souls escaping, he surmised), and gone was the raw power that seemed to exude from it. Now it was an extinguished star reaching its end. Its innards boiled and churned with black fire, it configurations increased until to look at it was painful. Sol looked down, content to walk the way to the box and contemplate his friend’s passing. He reached the box finally and it was like coming home. He reached to it and stroked its surface. The key slid home and there was an intake of breath sounding like an avalanche as the Wrath realised its undoing. An arc of fire bolted through the gloom at him and scorched the side of one leg. He screamed in pain and lifted the lid of the box. ‘NO MORE!’ he screamed and lunged into the darkness that lay within the box. Sound ceased instantly and his ears whistled and hissed with its leaving. He had no senses now it seemed, sight, sound and taste all rendered useless in the utter absence of everything. He welcomed it, and sank into unconsciousness. When light hit him again, it was the soft, welcoming glow of dusky sunlight filtering in through his living room windows. He was sitting on his chair, the key in one hand, the box on the couch opposite. The pain from his torn fingernail was the only thing that dissuaded him from the notion that it had been a dream. The lid of the box was open and smoke wafted lazily from it, redolent with the smell of ozone and fire. He stood and looked into the blackness. Nothing. Not even a hint of the nightmare contents that had almost ended his life, and taken the life of his friend. He sat on the floor, rested his head on the side of the box, and cried. The days passed slowly for Sol, blurred round the edges as if he was looking through smoke. He ate, drank, worked. And he thought of Danté. He would be on a bus and would see his whiskered grin peering at him from a stranger. Sitting in his car, he would pass him on the street, see the casual wave of a hand, see, and sometimes hear, the crack of his whip-tail. He had unplugged his phone as soon as he had woken up that first night, and yet sometime, always at night, he would hear whisperings down the line, screeches and muted howls that took him back. Back to hell. Four days later, eyes blood-shot and tired from lack of sleep, Sol hefted the box into the back of his car. He drove for miles, through villages, across lonely desolate moors where lightning jagged down from the clouds the Wrath and thunder split the air in deafening peals. He stopped next to a crumbling dry-stone wall, and opened the back door of his car. He looked at the box for a moment, and quickly, as if to deny himself any real thinking time, he grabbed it and slung it over the wall. It landed softly in the mud, one corner sinking in it. That night he dreamed. Danté was berating him, silently, as if a ghost, beating his tiny clawed hands on Sol’s chest. He was whisked away into the air suddenly, by hands made of black fire, and a deafening laugh rent the air so that Sol’s ears began to slowly bleed. The Wrath grew above him, larger and more violent than ever, faces appearing and then disappearing as quickly as Sol could focus on them. One face remained, however. That of Danté. Stretched and wrought into a nightmare of features, it screamed down at him, begging, pleading to be released. Sol tried to speak but was cut off by the intense noise. Suddenly all sound was silenced in a shock of pain and fresh blood coursed from his ears. The Wrath had finally deafened him. Sol had time to think how ironic it was that the one thing that the Wrath had used to tempt and terrify him, was the one thing that finally stopped the Wrath being terrifying. Without noise, it was no more than an angry cloud, venting its power. Sol closed his eyes, and without sight, the Wrath was nothing. A hand closed on his. He opened his eyes, sat up in bed, fully awake. The hand scratched slowly down his and disappeared. He flicked on the bedside lamp, which sat on a chair, and saw nothing. You must come back, Sol. You must come back for me… The voice was scratchy, hissing like air escaping a tyre, but it was unmistakably Danté’s. Sol rubbed his hands across his face and looked again. Nothing. Was Danté still alive? Surely not, after seeing his blackened hulk vaporised by the Wrath, hearing and seeing his death throes as the guard was lifted into the mass of the Wrath. Sol agonised that point over breakfast, at work, over lunch, on the drive home and all through the next night and into the morning, without a minute’s sleep. He screamed his frustration at the bathroom mirror, marvelling at the demented, unshaven beast that screamed back at him. He left the house for the last time the next morning. A cold, metal object sat in his pocket, and when he touched it, chimes sounded, a thousand chimes, a hundred thousand; all of them ringing in a wind that he could not feel. The key. He drove through villages, across desolate moors where the clouds hung low and oppressive. He stopped by a dry-stone wall, and got out of his car. He had the unerring single-mindedness of a man contemplating suicide. He looked over the wall, knowing what he would see. The box sat where he had dropped it, one corner sinking slightly into the thick mud, the dull glow of its grain vibrant even in the morning gloom. He climbed the wall, unmindful of the avalanche of stones that preceded him. As he pulled the key from his pocket, the box glowed deeper, and the chimes began again. Voices were raised in jubilation and as Sol lowered the key to the brass lock, he whispered, ‘I’m coming Danté. This is my portal; this is my way. I am the box. I am coming for you.’ The darkness lasted for a millenium. When light edged into his vision, Sol opened his eyes to a blackened, smoking, twisted ruin. The floor, where it had been grey and straight, was charred and pitted with fire. He looked upwards and saw nothing except long stretches of night. There was no end to it. Far off in the distance, he saw what had become of the Wrath. It was a thousandth of its size now, twisting and knotting itself like a coil of vipers in extremis. He smiled, and the Wrath boiled its anger down towards him. He would fear it again, he knew, but not yet. Not yet. He walked, and he found a shimmer. They called to him now, and he could see them like a silvery heat-haze in the air. He opened the door in the first one and was back in Danté’s room again. His room now, he supposed. He sat, drew the map of shimmers to him, and waited. Soon enough he would hear from Danté again, and he would know how to reach him. He would save him. He studied the map. He saw all his shimmers across the void, and he began to memorise them. As a Guard O’ the Wrath, he would need to know them. He smiled, and raised a glass of the green brew. Tomorrow, he would start exploring this place, and he would make himself ready for when the Wrath grew in power and size and threat. There would be people like himself to save. ",candidate00006
12,00001,candidate00007,"A guitar riff into the future PhD student Tim O’Shenko slipped out of the Portsmouth Guildhall for a smoke. In Britain the anti-smoking legislation had become severe. If caught lighting up in public Tim would be forced to smoke an extra two packets as punishment. Within the civic centre, Rin Tizzy Too, a Thin Lizzy tribute act, were giving their all. Unrestrained by convention, Thin Lizzy’s music barely appeared in their repertoire. Standards from TRex to Van Halen were straining the amplifiers. What the musicians lacked in talent, musicality or shame was compensated for in raw sound energy. A fan of retro-rock, Tim made his jailbreak when he could no longer bear the murder of classic anthems. Leaning against a tree near a poorly lit war memorial and drawing on his cigarette Tim wondered if his eyeballs were suffering from the concussive waves escaping the building because there was a haze around people queuing to get in. It was a surprise that people still wanted in when everyone in the city could hear the quality of the performance. Stunned pigeons lying around the guildhall square legs twitching to the beat should have been ample warning. It was then Tim spotted himself handing over his ticket to enter the building. Space-time was being warped by Rock! The next morning Tim’s thoughts galloped like crazy horses as he walked through basement levels of the Physics Faculty at the University of Portsmouth. Here were the laboratories above which was Tim’s little office. A theory solidified as he sat down in front of his computer. Tim wrote his extraordinary paper in a day. Equations, squiggly diagrams and the word ‘quantum’ flowed from his fingers and into the computer. The universe was vibrations of the quantum foam. Sound was vibrations and the vibrations of the quantum foam. If a sound was shaped so were the quantum vibrations. If you had an amplifier of suitable power then the universe could be changed with the right tune. Macro and quantum universes weren’t supposed to interact directly, but he and two dozen traumatised birds had seen it. Tim didn’t take the concept too far because this was radical thinking and could lose him his research grant. Instead he framed it as a proposal that sound could cross a vacuum by measuring the changes on a quantum level. There was Heisenberg to deal with, but Tim prided himself on being able to win research grants (his lifestyle depended on it) and thus Heisenberg would become the key to asking for more beer money. Tim never thought that his progress was being monitored. A virus so sinister that it made computers run faster and with less crashes had infected every machine on the planet. It watched for keywords. Tim won the prize for most used keywords that decade; he would have to be dealt with. Confidently emailing his great work to his professor Tim decided now was a good time for a beer. The email was intercepted and rerouted as he shut the door to his office. The contents of his computer were wiped as he walked through the subterranean halls. His paper notes would vanish with a cleaner who only did one night’s work. Wisely the city planners had placed a row of pubs directly outside the university’s main buildings. For lunch Tim had three pints and, to make sure he wasn’t drinking on an empty stomach, a bag of peanuts. It was nearly 3pm when he decided he should return to work. With a mellow feeling of a man who knows he’s very clever Tim ambled down the steps of the hostelry. A stretched limonene with blacked out windows aligned itself with its target. Tim ambled across the narrow road. The vehicle accelerated. Tim crossed safely then heard the car draw up behind him. “Excuse me,” said a husky-voiced female. A woman leaned out of the back window. He was aware of a national cleavage shortage and could see why. This girl was using up half the country’s supply. He didn’t register her face because of the barely constrained orbs threatening to escape her skin-tight black leather minidress. “Er… yes?” “I am looking for the Physics Building,” she whispered provocatively forcing Tim to lean closer, which he didn’t mind at all. “It’s up those steps on the corner.” “Oh good, physics turns me on. Are you a physicist?” Tim’s throat had gone dry. “Yes,” he squeaked. “Oh good.” “Oh good,” he repeated. Physics groupies were a particular unfulfilled hope for Tim. If she were slightly drunk she’d be perfect. “I need a place to park this car, would you help me?” The door popped open and the girl uncurled her long legs sheathed in fishnet stockings ending in high stilettos. “Oh good… er, I mean oh yes. These a par cack, I mean, car park. There’s a car park. Oh yes, I can help.” Tim climbed in with the girl who managed to run those beautiful legs against his. Thoughts one hundred percent carnal were interrupted when she stunned him with a Taser. Water splashed over Tim’s face. He awoke on a gilded nineteenth century chaise lounge. Towering over him was the girl dressed as before hence it took a long time for him to spot the Taser in the opposite hand to the glass of water. “He’s up,” she stated then poured the rest of liquid on his face. “Cool,” coo-ed a man. Tim had moments to take in a room big enough to house aircraft, full of antiques of random taste and style. They had been arranged in the same way a toddler arranges its playthings. The man approached offering his hand. Expecting violence Tim recoiled then had a good look at the man and recoiled in fashion shock. Physicists are usually immune to this since most stick to the rule: thin for hot weather, thick for cold and leave tailoring details to others. A wiry man nearing fifty he wore a T-shirt and shrink-tight jeans. His face was lined through years of excess that Tim would never be able to match even in his physics groupie fantasies. His hair was like an electrocuted poodle. Ringlets of defunct dog hung loosely dancing about as he moved. “I know you,” Tim said cautiously shaking the man’s firm hand. “Sure you do, but call me Fahrenheit, or Mr F for short. You are clever Tim O’Shenko. You worked it all out didn’t you? Spotted our clues: the spaceships on the album covers and videos. Why someone with a PhD in astrophysics gave up the pleasures of hard science be the lead guitarist in a rock band. The Einstein/Stones tongue clue. Not that Mick understands what’s going on, but he’s always game.” “Yes… er, yes,” Tim stuttered without any clear idea of what was going on. “I don’t think he gets it,” Ms Taser said. “Katie, he can’t get it until we show him. Can yer man?” “No, best to show me.” Tim agreed hoping to reduce the likelihood of future electric shocks. “You’re not the first to discover the link between music and space-time,” Mr F began. “After that mistake with the atom bomb, the scientists who discovered it couldn’t dare share this secret with politicians. That was where rock met science!” Mr F ended like Tim would understand. “Yes indeed,” Tim said after realising there was a pause for him to speak. “He doesn’t get it,” Katie said. “Over thirty years ago it was discovered that if you pick the right rock track, amplify it then focus in the right direction whoooooosh!” “Whoosh,” Tim agreed, then pointing at Katie, “Don’t say it. I think I’ve got it.” Pause. “Nope, you’ll have to tell me.” “Faster than light drive.” There was a longer pause as Tim didn’t know whether to laugh (and get stunned again) or continue pausing (and delay being stunned). “Yeah man, my musical brothers and I supply the rock, Katie and her egghead dudes do the science and whoooooosh!” “Stadium rock works best,” Katie stated with a sour expression. “Rock stars earn lots of money which helps. Half the tech here was built under guise of rich men’s whims or set designs. Say you try to buy heavy water in bulk. Every intelligence agency in the world will be going through your trash.” “Hey, I just said I wanted the most expensive water in the world for my pool and they said how much do you want. Cool huh? Champagne fountain, heavy water pool, no one cares. Then of course my buddy wants to out do me and orders the same; then my other buddy does the same. No one cares.” “We make our own now on a Caribbean island owned by —” “By?” “Need to know,” Katie said, “Exclusive recording studio.” “With the biggest damn power station you ever saw!” added Mr F. “Shall we give him the tour?” “Kinda pointless bringing him here if we don’t,” she replied. “Cool, I love showing off.” Tim thought the same could be said of Katie in her revealing attire. “Follow me Tim. This is the European base of operations, rock and science united in making a better world.” Mr F explained leading them to double doors inlaid with silver. “Got everything here indoor Olympic pool, gym, beach volleyball.” Beyond was an elevated walkway either side were huge rooms. There were men and women in each enjoying the luxury. “It’s important to stay chilled. Get fit in mind and body and party!” Tim stopped to look down on the beach volleyball court where four bikini clad women were raking the sand at the end of a game. “I thought you’d be more interested in the library,” Katie thumbed on the opposite side of the walkway. Reluctantly Tim switched sides. Sweeping away were four storeys of book shelves. “We get every learned journal and have on-tap any research material you might want.” “Hmmm,” he said noncommittally. “The off-duty librarians were playing volleyball.” “And do you play volleyball?” Tim recovered more quickly from being Taser-ed the second time. Mr F was slapping his face. “Katie doesn’t like dumb-ass remarks about how she looks,” Mr F warned too late. “She used be forty pounds heavier and got a lot of comments, now she’s fit she still gets comments.” “Fit’s the word I’d use,” said Tim after checking Katie was no where in sight. “No one asks Katheryne about the dozen papers in Nature she’s written on quantum cosmology and superconductors, just her body. It’s the downside of being a dancer.” “Dancer? Katie… Katheryne… ” Tim clambered up. “Yeah, she’s one of my dancers when the band tours. Great way to visit our friends without being of any interest to anyone, drop out child prodigies are two a penny.” “Katheryne… cosmology and superconductors. Featherstone! That’s K K Featherstone! Good God!” Tim looked at Mr F. “I thought she’d vanished into some University. She’s got to be thirty-four, thirty-five.” Ancient to the twenty-seven year old Tim. “Thirty-eight.” “She is fit.” “Word to the wise, if you don’t want a fat lip don’t talk about her body.” Mr F pushed open matching double doors at the end of the walk way and into a grand dinning room. This was Renaissance decadence with a twenty-first century twist. It was gold, gaudy and garish to the point of criminality. Tim stopped to stare whilst Mr F continued down the length of a table large enough to play hockey on. “We kept this and the bedrooms for show, but scooped out the rest of the chateau. We got four sound stages, dance studio, forty-babe hot tub, roadies, electricians, pyrotechnicians, set builders, geeks of every shade. All you need to keep a world-shaking rock band on the road or a science network under wraps.” Upon reaching the other end of the table Mr F discovered he was alone. “Tim, keep up or you’ll miss your flight.” “This is either real or the greatest wind up in history,” Tim said. “Hey, Tim, you’re a nobody. You ain’t worth my time for some kind of gag.” “How do I know you don’t get off on suckering nobodies?” “I get off on sleeping with as many women as I can and the adulation of fifty thousand screaming fans who want to be me! Occasionally smoking a spliv staring into Jupiter’s great red spot at point blank range does it for me too. C’mon man I didn’t bring you to France for this.” Tim hurried along the table with two time zones. “I can’t be in France, I wasn’t out that long.” “Depends on how fast you can go and I am fast!” Mr F took Tim around the chateau explaining how they were channelling their discoveries to help mankind, whilst anything with weapon potential was strictly kept for them. The tour ended in a leather-lined room in the centre of the building, cameras and screens were inset into the tanned cow walls. “We do TV interviews and satellite link-ups here,” Mr F said. Gesturing with a finger Mr F called Tim over, who was gaping at very familiar furnishings. “Didn’t you do that notorious MTV awards link in here? You were all doped to the eyeballs.” “Man, we were sober as judges except… except we’d just come back from saving Delhi from being totalled by a meteor. Trust me; you can’t get a high like that with drugs.” Mr F pressed a stud in the leather and a stainless steel pole rose up from the floor. Hidden coloured lights began playing their beams over it and the floor around. “Don’t tell me Katie does that kind of dancing.” “Maybe on her days off,” Mr F said pressing a second stud that caused the floor beneath the pole open. He slid, via the pole, out of sight. Tim followed and nearly broke his ankles crashing into the floor. “Always wanted to be a fireman – not!” Mr F explained pulling Tim upright. They were in a mechanic’s workshop if mechanics created exotic abstract sculptures out of gold and silver. Around the walls were benches with hundreds of drawers above and below. Amongst the strange items were more familiar ones; such as: soldering irons, sheaths of paper, mugs of coffee, paper aeroplanes, a handful of butchered Fender Stratocasters and a Moog that had been forced to mate with an amplifier. Paper notes were stapled to the walls. Computers with huge screens were showing graphs morphing into mathematical landscapes as iterations evolved. Tim could smell ionising air. There was the hum of high voltage. A tingling sensation warned him of the same. Also there was a rising excitement. This was a physics lab. Here were the equations that he had solved last night made real. Rock chicks in fishnet stockings might punch his biological buttons, but the biggest hits he got were when the weirdness of physics exploded into the madness of reality. “She solved the vacuum energy problem.” “Katie and others; apparently you gotta realise there isn’t a vacuum and zero is zero, but not nothing or something like that, but hey that’s not for me to fret about.” Mr F had to take Tim by the shoulders to pull him away from the hypnotic power of complex mathematics. They stood in a hanger and in front of the most amazing object Tim had ever seen. Seeing it confirmed everything, apart from what Katie did on her days off, was Gospel truth. “It’s based on a Lamborghini Diablo,” Mr F said ushering Tim toward it. “Nah, actually the Diablo is based on it.” Mr F continued talking yet Tim couldn’t hear him. His eyes studied every line of the extraordinary vehicle. It was a big faceted wedge angled like a sprinter straining on starting blocks. Sharp edged panels blended into a central transparent sphere that was obscured by ribs running bow to stern flowing around the shapes and looking like cooling fins which they couldn’t be. The rear became black blocks two stories high. Crazy Little Thing was written in gold letters riveted onto the flanks of the blocks. “No heat shielding or scorching,” Tim mumbled. It was impressive he retained enough self-control not to dribble. “It’s sheathed in a nickel super alloy for safety, but Mercury class ships have enough spare power to slow themselves down before hitting the atmosphere so no significant frictional heating.” Katie had returned. She was the only sight that could break the siren hold of the Crazy Little Thing because it looked like she’d been dipped in white chocolate with tubes and wires set into the coating in all the places that Tim would have chosen to make a great body achieve perfection. He was drooling now. Katie threw a large white blob that hit him full in the face. Pulling it away as it threatened to suffocate him, Tim discovered it was an identical costume to Katie’s. It flowed in his grip. “Put it on,” Katie commanded. “What this?” Rolling her eyes heavenward, she said, “You did write that paper didn’t you? You’re not some clerical error?” “I did; I’m suffering from information overload.” “It’s your spacesuit. It’s elasticated so it doesn’t have to be pressurised also it exercises your muscles so they don’t atrophy as fast.” “It feels thick,” Tim said realising it was the reason the woman’s curves were curvier than before. “Two layers sandwich microscopic piezoelectric crystals, it behaves like a non-Newtonian fluid so it goes hard if impacted, protects from micro-meteors. It’s an insulator too so you won’t cook or freeze.” “I know what a non-Newtonian fluid is. It’s why you can walk on custard.” “We’ve all walked on custard,” Mr F stated and both scientists looked at him. “I don’t need a spacesuit,” Tim said. “Yes you do, now take all your clothes off and put it on. Use the changing room over there.” “Right, right,” Tim said. Her second skin gave no place for her to hide a Taser; he decided not to be proven wrong and headed for the changing room. “Have I got to take everything off?” “The suit reacts in antiphase to the acoustic pressure the engines flood the cabin with. Electrical charges pulse through the suit to affect the crystals to prevent you being pulverised by the sound waves. It works like those sound neutralising headphones you can buy. Wear something underneath and you’ll get bruised at best, broken at worst.” Doubtful but obedient Tim entered the changing room. He undressed then picked up the white costume that oozed between his fingers. Having never worn a cat suit before, Tim faced the challenge uncertainly, giving the stretchy material a tug or two finding pulling it quickly it became stiff whilst a slow pull made it yield easily. Unlike the lithe woman with a dancer’s suppleness, the only dexterous feat Tim had could claim was drinking a pint of beer through his nose. The neck hole was the single entrance; it stretched against his effort to snap snugly around his neck when released. Unfortunately his head was in the outfit and his naked body outside. Greater effort was required to extricate his head before he suffocated as panic lead to hard yanking which caused the suit to put up maximum resistance. Tim fought like a streaker attacked by an epileptic albino squid until the suit eased off his head with a pop. After that with much wriggling and swearing, Tim finally wore his new attire. Tim did look coated in white chocolate except it had melted gathering in creases and bulges around his gut. Returning to the Crazy Little Thing, the more pleasant vision in white had donned a large helmet and handed him one. The headgear clamped on his neck and the padding inside began expanding sealing the neck joint. A high fidelity voice reached his ears. “Can you hear me?” It was Katie. “Yes,” Tim said. “Good, follow me.” The Crazy Little Thing was lined in the same yielding material as the suit. Tim didn’t manage to have much of a look around as he was led up to the cockpit. He realised most of the volume of the craft was engines and power generation. Katie pushed him into one of a pair of Recaro seats with five-point racing harnesses. He tried to act like a scientist as she fastened him in. “You’ve said the engines are based on amplifiers but what is supplying the energy, it must take one hell of a lot.” Katie slipped into the pilot’s seat and hit a button. The craft lurched into the vertical as the ceiling slowly slid out of the way. Briefly water poured from the growing view of the sky. “The main complex is under the house, but the hangar doors are under the pool. Water is a great radar absorber. Mind you it’s also lined with anechoic materials.” “I asked about the power.” “Fusion.” “Cold or Hot?” “Jazz.” The ship’s controls were pedals for speeding up and slowing down and a wheel for turning. Katie shifted in to D and floored it. Tim awoke to a bright slivery glow. “You’re going to have to get fit if you want to do this regularly.” “I wasn’t ready, I pulled must have been nine or ten g’s.” “Four. It’s about then inertia is cancelled out.” Out of the window was the Moon or rather five hundred meters away a bright wall of craters and softly sloping terrain. “Stone me,” Tim observed The landscape continued to grow. “Aren’t we getting a little close?” Katie ignored him. Crazy Little Thing swooped in. The peanuts he’d eaten earlier wanted to leave, his stomach wanted to follow. He could feel his lack of weight: this was real. He wanted to follow his stomach. The craft descended onto the surface. Outside was the base of a lunar lander sitting in the centre of a blast pattern. Less than five meters away from Crazy Little Thing’s bow stood an American flag. “This can’t be real,” Tim said out loud to convince his digestive system; otherwise the inside of the suit wouldn’t stay white. “You’ve got me in a simulator. This is a wind up. No radiation. I’m getting no flashes where cosmic rays fly through my eyeballs.” “We’re shielded. Mercuries are good up to a coronal mass ejection outside the orbit of Venus.” “That flag, it was blown over when Apollo Eleven returned to the command module.” “It has fallen down three times in the last fifty years. Some of our American members tend to it. Twice we’ve had to get it back when others put up the Confederate flag instead. Let me show you something.” Shifting into R Crazy Little Thing backed away from the historic site. It spun on its vertical axis (by pulling the spin-in-vertical-axis lever) then headed for a nearby hillock. Skimming over sterile regolith the ship followed the curve of the land to dip into a shallow valley and then up to a taller peak. Tim’s knuckles were white inside their white cushioned gloves. In a power slide Katie brought the Crazy Little Thing to a stop on the summit. In front of Tim was a field of flags. Almost every nation was represented. “Now’s the moment of decision,” Katie said. “You have to decide whether you’re with us or not.” “What happens if I’m not?” “You’ll never go into space again.” “Oh God, you’re going to kill me. This is all to lure me away so my body will never be found.” Katie’s groan was thunderous. “We’re not that kind of secret organisation; that’s so clichéd. Haven’t you got any imagination?” “I have a great imagination, but I know all your secrets —” Katie stifled a laugh. “You’ll have to keep me silent from telling the world.” “What? That spacecraft propelled by Rock are controlled by a conclave of scientists and musicians?” “Er… yes, but you’re K K Featherstone. You’ve got science cred.” “Look up my history sometime. I am a burnt out wunderkind. I haven’t written a paper for twenty years.” “Ah, but my work—” “Will be discredited,” Katie said. “You can join us and help slowly bring incredible technology to the world without being used for war or, if you don’t want to, we’ll set you up in one our research companies with a salary so big you’ll forget about telling the world anything. Choosing option two means you never see the inside of a spacecraft again.” Tim looked at Katie’s helmet and wondered what her face looked like. “I need a smoke.” “There are some cigars in a humidor in the chill out room. Look for the drinks cabinet.” “This ship has a drinks cabinet?” “It’s for Rock Gods; the cabins have mirrored ceilings too.” “I’m in.” ",candidate00007
13,00002,candidate00007,"The praying never stopped at St. Barbara's convent and Mary couldn't stand it any more. She had joined the convent in February and now during an oppressive August night the rhythmic verses were boring into her mind releasing all she had been suppressing. Waking Mary wanted to dash her throbbing head on the rough brick walls of her cell. Staggering into the corridor she groped in the half-light toward the nearest barred window. Beyond the bars were the industrial shadows of London's East End. For all her need to escape the relentless pressure, Mary couldn't face what awaited her in the outside world. Resting her head on the cool bars eased the pulsating pain. Rubbing her forehead on the coarse metal distracted her enough for a moment's peace. Maybe she was going down with the fever that had been afflicting the nuns. Each day there was another woman missing. The thinning numbers had become noticeable, even to someone new like Mary. A candle glow appeared at the end of the corridor. Mary flopped to the ground hoping her white nightgown wouldn't be seen. The candle bearer passed. The novice wondered why she had hidden. Guilt probably, a legacy of her past life, like the slight trembling of her hands. It made Mary follow the light. Three nuns shared the candle. They walked in silence descending from the dormitory floors through the living spaces and into the cellar. A Victorian pile St Barbara's sat on a huge cellar; a vaulted area of heavy columns divided with brick walls into rooms. The party stopped near the stairs by some disused cells. Hiding by a column, Mary could finally see enough to identify the women. Sister Rachel, doctor for the convent's clinic for 'fallen women', pulled a heavy bolt on one of the cells. Sister Beatrice, the mother superior, was revealed by the light coming from the cell. She rested her hand on Rebecca; the only person Mary would call a friend. An innocent girl of twenty, Rebecca had seen none of the world and didn't want to, unlike the thirty-year-old novice. She'd found her calling early seizing it with a single-minded focus Mary was jealous of. Rebecca who took it upon herself to help novices. She and Mary always breakfasted together. Sister Beatrice ushered her into the cell. The bolt was thrown, padlocked in place and the remaining women left. Mary held herself tightly to the shadows allowing the others to pass before creeping to the cell door. Ear pressed to the door Mary thought she could make out Rebecca praying, then there was a gasp. Mary sat in Sister Beatrice's office opposite the full authority of the mother superior. She had been summoned the next morning after breakfast, which Rebecca had missed. Sister Beatrice was in her early forties with clean striking features. There was cunning in her eyes and a thin smile as if she knew what life could offer and had enjoyed experiencing it all. ""You left this behind,"" the mother superior stated holding up the tip of a broken knife. ""Before you deny it, I had your cell searched during breakfast. This was found."" The remainder of the knife appeared in her hands. ""I would prefer a confession Victoria."" When the cutlery broke in the lock the novice knew she was caught, but how had Sister Beatrice found out who she was? ""You know who I am?"" Victoria alias Mary replied. ""Do you think when a woman goes missing the police don't contact us? They know we collect girls who need help."" ""You haven't told my parents? Not about the baby."" ""Of course I haven't, but the police know you are safe and they will have passed the news on to your parents. You can contact them if you want to or not. Nothing has been said about the abortion. That is for your conscience. Now, Mary or Victoria, are you going to confess?"" ""I'd prefer Mary, I'm not proud of who I was."" ""Victoria still seems to be present. Was it her who was breaking into the drugs store?"" ""It's the drugs store?"" ""Are you denying your actions? I had so hoped you had freed yourself from the addiction to intoxicants."" ""I haven't touched any drugs since I came here. Not even the communion wine. I'm certain I saw you lock Sister Rebecca in that cell."" ""Why would I do that?"" ""I… "" Victoria was aware the older woman looked straight at her hands which she held tightly to stop them disobeying her. ""Are you still having the nightmares? I remember the delusions you suffered when we first found you."" Sister Beatrice asked. ""No I'm not delusional, I saw a light, I followed you and I saw you lock Rebecca in that cell."" ""I'm not sure she'd fit in the store, it's full of shelves. Delirium tremens produces vivid hallucinations. Perhaps you're not clear yet. How many nights did I sit with you screaming about demons and murder?"" Victoria's hands began shaking for a different reason. The eternal chanting coming from the chapel was hammering into her skull like nails. ""I've never said anything about demons. I'm sure I didn't say anything about demons."" ""You are troubled Victoria. You are still not at peace. I forgive you. Go and pray in the chapel, take time to organise your thoughts to know what is real and what isn't."" Victoria left without a word. Not to the chapel, but to search for Rebecca. Lying on her bed fully clothed Victoria waited for darkness to cover her escape. She had decided to leave before she too vanished. Evading Sister Beatrice's lieutenants as she searched, Victoria had failed to find her friend. Victoria knew she had to be in the cellar. It remained the only place yet to be examined. Victoria did find more empty cells than she expected. Each one like Rebecca's, Spartan and clean readied for the nun's return except some had dust thick enough to grey what it covered. Victoria decided she would search the cellars and escape by them, through the coal cellar's hatch. It was a matter of waiting for the convent to sleep. While dusk turned to night, and the river traffic of the world's greatest port quietened, Victoria tried to remember every night in the clinic's wards. Victoria was sure in all the nightmares, all the pain, she had said nothing about the night that had left her lying in an ally. Perhaps she had called her best friend's name. Maybe she repeated the pleading in her fever. Never would she have mentioned demons. Ceaseless Latin verse cycled through the fabric of the convent. Voices rebounding in her head, steady and unending grew clearer as all other sounds faded. An oppressive heat rose with the night, she sweated and feared until finally she acted. Along the empty corridors Victoria travelled quietly. All the while there was an urge to run, dash wildly and keep running until she was as far from the echoing halls and sounds in her head. At the top of the stairs to the cellar Victoria stopped. Without a light the windowless void below was as black as blindness. Her hands were shaking again. Memories of another cellar and a gunshot. Perhaps she could save a friend this time. Into the cellar Victoria felt for every tread the memory of the layout turning in her mind as she approached the locked cell like it was the edge of a cliff. ""Victoria,"" Sister Beatrice's voice softly rang. An oil lamp was uncovered its dazzling light froze Victoria. The mother superior and Sister Rachel were blocking the stairs. She must have walked between them. ""Victoria,"" Sister Beatrice began. ""No!"" Victoria shouted and a second knife stolen for attacking the padlock was in her hand. ""Get back."" ""Victoria, we want to help."" ""No."" ""Rachel, if you'd be so kind,"" Beatrice said. With practiced skill the doctor lunged catching and twisting Victoria's wrist. A thumb in the correct joint and shooting pain forced Victoria to drop the blade. Rachel continued to twist the arm forcing it behind Victoria's back. Victoria screamed defiance and dived for the floor pulling free almost dislocating her limb in the process. Scrambling up Victoria bolted for the coal store door, shouldering it open she stopped. Lying on pallets hands crossed over their chests were nuns. There were at least thirty women with spaces ready for a dozen more. A lighted candle at the head of each made their cold white skin glow. Sister Rachel grabbed Victoria from behind. Victoria threw herself backward arms flaying. Rachel lost her grip. Victoria snatched up a brass candlestick ignoring the hot wax spilling on her hand. Rachel recovered and came for Victoria again. Wheeling Victoria hit Rachel with all her weight. She felt and heard Rachel's skull crack. The nun crumpled. On the floor a thin line of blood, black in the poor light, flowed lazily from her head. Staring at what she had done for once Victoria's thoughts were louder than the praying. Sister Beatrice arrived. ""Get back,"" Victoria warned, preparing for another strike. Ignoring the blunt instrument wavering above her, Sister Beatrice bent down to check for pulse and breathing. ""Her breath is regular; the bleeding is not as bad as it looks."" With a handkerchief she made up a pad for the wound. ""She'll survive, but she'll be of no use tonight."" ""I want out of here,"" Victoria demanded. It was happening again. Violence seemed to be part of her soul, bubbling up with tragic consequences. To survive she had to escape and to do that she would have to brain another victim. Hands shaking as if eager to move in a fatal downward arc she gripped the candlestick with two hands holding it back. ""I cannot let you leave here, you are too dangerous."" Sister Beatrice said standing. ""Me? I am too dangerous? What about these women you've killed?"" ""I've hurt no one. I will never hurt a living soul."" ""What about them?"" Victoria's wild eyes flicked about the room yet her impromptu weapon stayed ready to strike again. ""The sisters here are in coma. They will recover, but will sleep for several weeks. It is the penalty for donating more blood than is safe to do so, but the cause is vital."" Sister Beatrice edged closer, ""You have killed. I know of two, but will there more?"" ""How..?"" ""The praying still hurts you doesn't it? It burns in your head, getting worse each day?"" ""Let me out. Please let me out,"" Victoria begged, her arms wilting. ""I had hoped we could help you because this convent is a protected place. Evil cannot enter here, but you are cursed and bound to it. You are doomed."" ""It's not true."" ""Cursed by the friend you killed and too quick to violence to stay here."" ""I'm not damned,"" Victoria whispered, after months of repression, a tear finally escaped. ""The incantations of faith bring peace, but not to those who are already lost."" Beatrice took the candlestick and placed it on the floor. ""While you live you can still do good."" ""I'm cursed. I bring death,"" Victoria said. ""Not even my own child was safe."" ""Change that tonight,"" Beatrice urged. ""We shelter those who work against the darkness. One was tracking a new evil to the city. He was trapped in the open when dawn came. One of my patrols found him like they found you. For once I offer you a chance to save a life."" The mother superior took Victoria's hand and led her to the locked cell. Sister Beatrice unlocked and opened the door. An oil lamp filled the room with light. On the bed was a man. His once handsome face had been burned with a terrible heat, a shadow of his hand held up to shield him from the fire was clearly visible. Those hands lay outside the bed fingers charred stubs. Victoria was drawn to the man. She sat on the stool by his bed. His eyes bandaged, mole-like he turned to Victoria, sniffing. ""Why's he sniffing?"" ""It's the tiny droplets of Rachel's blood on your habit. It's exciting his baser nature."" ""One can't smell blood."" ""That poor wretch can,"" the Mother Superior said. ""He needs it to survive. Normally he can live on substitutes, but if he is to recover from these injuries he has to take human blood and the essence of our souls it contains."" Victoria felt her world shifting from the reality. She wondered if this was a trick of her drug-damaged brain. Was she in fact lying in some gutter her mind spinning stories as life finally ebbed away? ""What are you saying?"" ""The truth."" Beatrice paused before sighing. ""His Christian name is Paul. Given to him by St Martin of Tours. Paul has fought evil ever since, but his own crimes fill centuries. He has no soul yet works for redemption."" ""What is he?"" ""Someone in need of help. In need of your help."" Paul's deformed fingers were reaching for Victoria. She stood up backing away. ""I can't help anyone I destroy everything I touch."" ""Here is where that can change. No one else is ready. I need you to help him. You simply have to stay with him and let him feed."" ""I can't."" Victoria looked back. Paul was growing in activity. Although bandaged, his eyes tracked her. Sister Beatrice continued. ""He will only take what he needs, but don't struggle. His animal hunger is close to the surface and behaving like prey would not be safe. He could kill you or worse."" ""Worse?"" ""He is waking will you do it?"" Victoria thought of her disintegrating life and how death was always in her hands. She sat down. Victoria took Paul's nearest hand. Corpse-cold it tightened on her fingers. ""Perhaps I might do good for once. Perhaps this is all a lie and this is my end. Perhaps for one night I won't fight."" Sister Beatrice shut the door and threw the bolt home. ",candidate00007
14,00001,candidate00008,"The house looks exactly like it did eighteen years ago—the brush grew thicker after Mama got sick—but the inside never changed. Now she’s gone and the house is mine and it’s October—Halloween is a week away and the memory seems like yesterday. I was nine years old and Halloween was only seven days away. I looked into the water of the Mohawk River one day and it was black. The kind of black you see when there’s a bad storm overhead and the shadows of the clouds are reflected in the river. Only there was no storm overhead and the sky was blue. I closed my eyes then looked again but the water didn’t change—just stayed black. “Mama, why is the water so dark?” “Dark? What do you mean, dark? It just like it’s always been, Sammy.” “No Mama, it’s black. Come and see.” I was standing in the doorway of our little brick house and Mama was stirring something on the stove. “In a minute, Sammy. This is almost done then I’ll walk down with you. Is it warm outside?” “Yes Mama.” The water had looked … swollen. Like something was there, just under the surface. I closed the door. “Okay Sammy I’m finished—let’s go.” “Maybe we should wait, Mama. I’m kind of tired.” “Oh c’mon sweetie—I want to go and you have to keep me company. Besides, you’re too young to be tired.” Mama reached for my hand and smiled—that special smile that always made everything seem all right. “Are you thinking about the story Mr. Toby told you? It’s just pretend, Sammy. There’s nothing that comes out of the water—it’s all made up.” But I held on tight as we walked down the path. “See, Sammy? There’s nothing wrong with the river. The water’s blue, not black.” And it was. It even felt normal again. Mama and I lived a half mile away from the school bus stop—down a short road bordered by trees to the first bend and along a narrow dirt road that went past a row of homes facing the river. Our house sat at the end of another short road, out of sight of the water. On my way home I was usually greeted by Daisy, the little pug dog that lived on the first corner. She would run down the drive and launch herself straight into my arms. The first time she did it she knocked me down and sat on my chest, grinning. On this day I rounded the bend and looked for her but she was nowhere in sight. I went on home, disappointed. “Mama, Daisy wasn’t there today. Do you think she’s sick?” “I don’t know, Sammy. Maybe she’s sniffing around somewhere—I think I saw her by the river earlier. She likes to dig. She’s probably still there. Change your clothes, honey, and take out the trash. Then you can play until supper.” “Sammy!” The voice belonged to my friend Eric, pedaling toward me on his bike. “Watcha doin’? Hey, I found a cool cave in the woods by the river. C’mon—I’ll show ya. I tried to see inside but it’s too dark. Today I brought a flashlight.” He parked his bike and we took off on foot down the path. It hit me as soon as we rounded the bend—the water—inky, black. I stopped. “Eric! Look at the river!” “C’mon! I wanna show ya this cave.” He kept going, getting further ahead. I stood rooted, watching the water move—rippling, swelling, then smoothing again. Like something was there, trying to escape. “Eric!” Panic made my feet fly. “Look at this, Sammy.” He was poking around in the brush, shining the flashlight. My heart was thudding against my rib cage. Imagination, I thought. Nothing can live underwater except fish. Eric and I soon discovered his cave was no more than a deep depression under a bank. We wandered around for a while, climbed an old tree with thick arms then walked back the way we came. When we reached the river, it was blue again—like the sky. Imagination. “Sammy, what do you want to be for Halloween?” Mama asked. “Let’s do something different this year. I was thinking—how about going as a creature that came from the river? You can pretend to be Mr. Toby’s monster. We’ll do you up really scary—I’ll make you a neat costume. What do you say?” Mama’s costumes were the best—no one ever guessed who I was. There were about ten of us that went from door to door—kids from our small neighborhood and the nearby town of Fairlee. She was looking at me, waiting for my answer and I wanted to tell her no—I wanted to say that I didn’t want to go trick or treating this year. Not after dark. Not by the river. Maybe I was too old. I told her that. “No, you’re not. Anyway, all your friends are going. Tell you what. I’ll surprise you, okay?” She smiled at me and busied herself at her favorite pastime—cooking. The river seemed to turn blacker. I tried not to look at it but couldn’t seem to help myself. My young mind began to wander along impossible roads. Images of misshapen creatures emerging from the water and creeping through the grass kept my attention riveted on the waters’ edge. It was Wednesday. Halloween was Friday. Daisy still hadn’t shown up and Eric’s dog, Mutt, didn’t come home last night. Then the wind started. “Sammy, be careful on the way to the bus stop this morning. It’s getting windy and things can drop on you from the trees.” “What things, Mama?” Visions of bats as big as hawks popped into my head. “You know, pine cones, or nuts—even limbs that have broken off but not yet fallen. Walk down the road, not under the trees.” She hugged me and pushed me out the door. “Scoot. You’ll miss your bus.” I stood on the steps and looked down our short road. Maybe I could cut through the woods behind the houses so I wouldn’t have to walk by the river. Mama raised the window. “Sammy, is something wrong? You’d better get moving—the bus driver won’t wait for you.” “Okay Mama, I’m going.” The notion of the woods was discarded—I’d probably get lost and Mama would skin me alive. A short while later I was running along the road by the river, keeping a watchful eye on the water. Just as I turned toward the road where the school bus stopped, something caught my eye. A form, like an outline. It seemed to be filled with liquid, undulating over the ground. What I heard was a splash, like the sound water makes when Mama empties a bucket out the door. What I saw was a face—Daisy’s face—only bigger. A lot bigger. I ran for the bus. “Sammy,” said Mrs. Sanders, “you don’t seem to be with us today. Are you feeling all right? Would you like to go to the nurse’s office?” ""No Mrs. Sanders. I’m okay.” I buried my nose in my book without seeing the words. The day lasted forever, and was over too soon. Then the bus was stopping, the door was opening—and I had to walk by the river. I descended the steps and my cap became airborne, flying to the other side of the road. By the time I captured it the bus was gone and I stood alone. Tree limbs thrashed as the wind picked up its assault, growing more intense with each passing moment. It swirled around me and turned cold—I closed my eyes against its fury. Then, as if someone turned off a switch, it stopped—leaving me in silence surrounded by air so dead it reeked. The sound started a long way off—a thin wail. As it came closer it grew louder and louder—like a scream rushing through a tunnel, echoing off the sides—and it was right on top of me. I was crouched on the ground and I was crying when I realized everything was normal again—it was quiet. When I stood, my knees bumped together and I leaned against the trunk of a tree until my legs decided to support my weight. I forced myself to walk, concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other. The turn in the road beckoned. My feet seemed to grow heavier until I could hardly lift them. I reached the corner in front of the house where Daisy lived—nothing was in sight. The short road spread out in front of me, leaves tumbling along the ground pursued by the relentless wind. I stayed as close to the houses as possible. Halfway home. Then—something was behind me, getting louder, coming fast. Visions of dogs’ faces with long yellow fangs—huge heads floating on air, stretching toward me from behind made my spine prickle. I ran. I wanted to scream, but it came out a whisper. “Hey Sammy! Wait up!” Eric’s voice jumped at me as his bike skidded to a halt. My legs turned to jelly and I sat hard, dropping my book bag beside me. He laughed. “Watcha doin’ down there? How come you’re not home yet? I beacha today. C’mon. Let’s do something. Sammy! Get up—ya gonna sit there all day?” He hopped back on his bike and took off toward my house. I scrambled to my feet and followed as fast as my rubber legs would allow. “Did Mutt come home?” I asked as we walked toward the woods. “Nah. Stupid dog probably got caught in a trap someplace. Pop says it’d serve him right—can’t never stay home. I kinda miss him, tho—was hopin’ he’d come back.” He shrugged. “Eric, if I ask you something promise you won’t laugh?” “What?” “Did you ever see anything—you know—funny, by the water?” “Like what?” “Do you remember the story Mr. Toby told us?” “You mean ‘bout animals 'n things disappearing and coming out of the water? D’ya think that happened to Mutt? Nah! That’s just dumb stuff. He was tryin’ to scare us. ‘Sides, the river looks the same.” “I saw it turn black.” “You did? How come I didn’t?” “I don’t know Eric, but he said not everybody could see it. He said it only happens every nine years and a girl disappeared last time and the water turns dark and this is the ninth year … ” “Ah—you’re just seein’ things. None of that other stuff is true. Stop bein’ a sissy, Sammy—forget it. Let’s go climb one of them big trees. Wouldncha like to make a tree house? Then we could see everything—nothin’ could ever sneak up on us. I found a good one in the woods next to the river. Some of the branches hang over—c’mon, I’ll show ya. You can climb right out over the water and look down.” He ran off ahead—he always did that. Once he made up his mind to do something, he was impatient to be doing it. I was forever trying to keep up with him. “Ain’t it neat?” He was staring up at a gnarled old tree that looked like it could fall into the river at any moment. “C’mon. I climbed it yesterday and you can see under water when the sun shines right.” He caught a low branch and swung himself up, then turned and put his hand down to me. I realized I had avoided looking to see what color the water was. He scrambled upward and I ventured a small glance toward the wet expanse and was relieved to see that it looked blue. “Eric, wait for me. What if you fall in?” “I can swim—can’t you?” “Well, I guess so—they taught us at camp last summer. But I never go swimming. Do you?” “Nah. But ya never forget once it’s learned. Lookit down there. Didn’t I tell ya?” We grinned at our twins in the water. As I looked, a gust of wind tried to dislodge me from the branch I was wrapped around and my reflection disappeared as the water turned inky. A light spot seemed to appear where my face had been and a wavy shape began threading slowly through it. It swirled around and around, holding my gaze, hypnotic, pulling at me. I hugged the branch so tight my arms hurt. “Eric!” I whispered. “Can you see what that is?” “What? Jeez Sammy, there’s nothing there—just our faces. C’mon—let’s walk down the bank a ways and see if there’s even a better tree.” He began backing down the thick trunk—I was still frozen in place with my eyes closed. “Whatsa matter Sammy—need help?” I half-opened my eyes and squinted at the water beneath me. It was blue again and the only thing in it was my reflection. I scurried down before it could change its mind. That night the wind sounded like it was trying to blow the house down. “Mama, are you sure nothing can live underwater but fish?” “Not for long, sweetie. Maybe snails, or plants, or things like that. Are you still thinking about that story?” “No, I was just wondering. Did you get my costume done?” “Almost. It’ll be finished when you get home from school. I have to stitch the bottom, then I’ll be through. It’s a surprise. You’re going to love it, I promise.” Thursday morning I hurried along the narrow road bordering the river. The wind was still trying to steal my cap. As I rounded the bend toward the bus stop, there was a noise from the edge of the water. I was afraid to look, and afraid not to. Around the corner I went, turned without stopping and walked backwards up the road as I tried to identify the sound. Something ran between the trees. Something big, like Mr. Bailey’s mule. Maybe it got loose. I stopped moving. It came around the front of the tree. Not a mule—a dog. It was Mutt, or almost Mutt—colors seemed to ripple inside the water-filled shape. It was coming toward me on stilted legs, its lip curled. I couldn’t move. It was at the edge of the road when the horn blew. I jumped and yelled, then turned and ran. When I looked back from the safety of the bus, there was nothing there. Had there ever been? Halloween morning the sky was gray. Mama was making cream of wheat and toast, my favorite breakfast. “Morning Sammy. Are you excited about trick or treating? Oh—Tim and Margie are sick so there’ll just be you and Eric from here. Danny Carol’s mom is going to bring the rest of them over. The wind isn’t blowing quite as hard this morning, maybe by tonight it’ll stop. Last night it would’ve blown the masks right off your faces. Here—sit and eat your breakfast. You don’t want to miss your bus.” She smiled at me and walked out of the kitchen. The only place the wind was blowing hard was by the water. I ran all the way to the bus stop, never looking anywhere except straight ahead. If anything was there, I didn’t want to see it. Maybe if I didn’t look, it wouldn’t look either. After school I ran all the way home from the bus stop. Mama was putting the ironing board away and I could see the colors of my costume draped over a chair. It was a mixture of yellows, rusts, grays and blacks covered with matted fur. Closer inspection revealed long pants and sleeves, with paws on the ends of all four. It also had a tail. It looked more like a wet dog than a monster from the water. “Mama, what’s it supposed to be?” “My own creation. We’ll call it a water dog. And it has a special face. Wait ‘til you see!” She went into her bedroom and came out carrying something. “Here—close your eyes so I can slip it on. Then you can look in the mirror.” I stood quietly as she put the soft mask over my head. “Okay. That came out great. You’ll fool them all. Go on and look.” I walked over to the mirror and Daisy’s pug face stared back at me. I yanked it off. “Sammy? What’s the matter, hon? Don’t you like it? I know how much you like Daisy—I thought you’d be pleased.” “Mama, Daisy never came back.” Her voice was soft when she answered. “Oh Sammy—I’m sorry. I didn’t know.” She paused. “Maybe she wandered into the woods and a bigger animal got her. It happens around here—you know that. She was so little. Honey, you don’t have to wear the costume. We can dress you up in old clothes … ” “No Mama, I like it—really. It just made me feel sort of funny for a minute. It’s a great costume.” I didn’t tell her about seeing Daisy, or Mutt—she’d say I was imagining things. Maybe I was. No one else saw them, or saw the river turn to ink, or whatever was in the water. “Hi Eric. Gee, you look great.” “Thanks. I made it myself.” He was wearing a pair of his dad’s coveralls and an old hat, his face painted with lipstick. Mama came into the room. “Hello Eric. You guys ready to go? Mrs. Carol should be here soon—it’s almost dark. Why don’t you wait for them outside?” We sat on the steps listening to the wind in the tree branches. From somewhere in the woods came the sound of something heavy crashing to the ground. Eric grinned at me. “This is a great night, huh Sammy? Spooky, like Halloween should be. Maybe there’ll be bats flyin’ around!” I didn’t tell him that spooky wasn’t exactly what I wanted, or that I didn’t want to do this at all. Eric wasn’t afraid of anything. We sat and watched the night creep up on us while we waited for Mrs. Carol. Then Mama came to the door. “Boys—Mr. Carol just called. Mrs. Carol’s car stalled a couple of blocks from their house and won’t start. They can’t make it, so why don’t you guys go to a few houses around here? I can go with you, if you’d like.” “No way! We’re not babies!” Mama laughed at Eric’s indignation. “I kind of thought you’d feel that way. All right then, but don’t be gone too long or I promise I’ll come looking for you.” She handed us both sacks and went back into the house. Eric, with his usual speed, took off down the path. The wind stirred the darkness and I hustled to catch up with him. “Listen!” Eric said. “Hear that? Sounds like a dog howlin’. Maybe it’s Mr. Toby’s ghost.” The sound carried on the wind, getting louder, then falling to a whisper. He glanced at me and shivered. “C’mon, let’s go. It really is spooky! Wish Mutt was with us.” A vision of Mutt as big as a mule came into my mind as we headed to the first house. “Trick or Treat!” “Oh you boys look so cute,” Mrs. Justin gushed. Eric looked at me and rolled his eyes. She dropped a handful of candy into our bags, we thanked her and left. “Let’s just do these houses and go back,” I said. “I don’t want to go by the river.” “Why not?” said Eric. “That’s where we get our best stuff. Stop being a scaredy cat.” “I am not!” A fleeting thought about leaving him alone was soon forgotten when I looked into the black night. “Okay,” I said, listening to the thrashing trees, “but let’s go. Maybe that wasn’t a dog.” As if on cue, the mournful sound began again. Eric frowned, making me laugh. All the lipstick across his forehead made him look as if he were smiling upside down. We were both giggling as we turned the corner. The apparition seemed to come out of nowhere. It was in the middle of the road. “Jeez! Do you see it?” My voice came out like a croak. “Whadya think I’m blind? ‘Course I see it. Sorta looks like Mutt, but it’s too big. What’ll we do?” We stood still, leaning against each other, when whatever it was lay down in the road and put its huge head on its paws. “There’s another one! Looks like Daisy!” His voice was hushed. It walked over next to the Mutt thing and sat, watching us. Eric looked at them, then at me. “That one looks like you,” he whispered. Only then did I remember what I was wearing. The Daisy thing was looking at me with its head cocked to one side. “Eric, they’re all wet, like they came out of the water.” They watched us. We were afraid to look away. “We could back up real slow. Maybe they’ll stay there and we can get to your house. Try it.” One foot, then another, and another … the Mutt thing stood. We stopped, clutching each other. I must have made a noise—Eric jabbed me. We were shaking so hard our teeth chattered. “We gotta run,” I said. “We can’t stay here.” “They’ll get us. Look how big they are. I’m sorry I called ya a scaredy cat.” His voice was thick. “Maybe they’re not real. C’mon, just turn and run toward my house. Don’t stop and don’t look back. Run as fast as you can.” The Daisy thing sat and the Mutt thing looked at it. “Wait! Maybe it’ll lay down again. Then we run. Okay?” “Okay,” he said, his tone quavery. We stood there while time stopped. Finally the Mutt thing lowered itself to the ground. My hand tightened on Eric’s arm. The Daisy thing stood, sniffed the air toward us, then lay in the road. “Now!” I said, and ran. I could hear Eric’s footsteps thudding right behind me. Then all I could hear was my own blood pounding in my ears to the beat of my heart. I never once looked back. All that happened eighteen years ago. I don’t remember the following months. Mama left the river and took me to her sister’s. They said it was a long time before I spoke again. The next summer trees were cleared and a new road was built on the other side of the houses by the river. The old dirt road disappeared beneath the weeds—a place where strange shadows sometimes appeared. Shadows, like wet animals—and once, a young boy. Mama went back to live in the little brick house when I turned sixteen—I stayed with my aunt. I never go out after dark during Halloween weeks. My friend Eric? No one knows. He disappeared that long ago night—without a trace. ",candidate00008
15,00002,candidate00008,"HARD EYES GLITTERED as they watched the dim figure behind the wheel. That long ago night, never forgotten. She would be the same – older, but that same contrived innocence as before. He touched the spot that she had touched – the scar that started below his right eye, curved downward, trailed along his chin. No feeling, as if his hand was touching someone else. The car door opened slowly, foot hesitant as it touched the ground. When she closed the door he barely heard the sound. She approached, eyes wide in the moonlight, the flashlight in her hand still off. At the steps she stopped, looked down at them for a moment – straightened her body and climbed onto the porch. Her hand reached for the doorknob. A grin split his face. His time had come at last. This time, she would not leave. … 1988… It was almost hypnotic, driving along this dark country road. Trees bordered the road on the right with the occasional farmhouse appearing on the left. I switched on the car radio and the first thing I heard was a song from my youth. Donna’s face appeared in my thoughts. We were so different – she with her pretty blond hair and brown eyes, me with dark hair and blue eyes. She was confident and I always worried about everything. Donna used to tell me that was fine, “You keep me out of trouble Sara” she’d say, “you keep me safe” and she’d hug me. Our parents first met at the hospital the night we were born and we had been best friends ever since. I loved her dearly and couldn’t image life without her. Today we’d both be thirty-six. She’s been gone for twenty years and I still missed her. I needed to close my eyes. Next pull off…and there it was! Doors locked, I sat looking at my surroundings. So quiet. The moon hung low and pale and yellow, throwing shadows across the landscape. This place looked familiar. Something had happened here long ago, and now it was trying to surface from the bottom of forgotten memories. Déjà vu. My one true experience had been at an old cabin in a clearing in the woods. These woods. My friends disappeared from that cabin twenty years ago. I stopped the thought, closed my eyes, drifted…dreamt… Laughter drifted up from across the years – voices I knew, friends from high school. All except Bill. He was Donna’s. He was also older and taboo. Donna didn’t care – she was mad about him and I couldn’t figure out why. He was tall and thin and always had grease under his nails. That was okay, but he never looked clean. Like he didn’t bathe often. But we put up with it – he had a car! There were four of us – driving along, laughing, passing cigarettes back and forth and sharing bottles of beer. All except me. I didn’t like the taste and said so. They made fun of me at first – tried to get me to drink but I never would. The radio blared country music and we all sang along. I was sixteen and in heaven. Donna was my exact opposite – wild where I was timid, brave where I was shy, defiant where I was obedient. I was not like them. But they accepted me. Night quiet shrouded the fields, the road, the trees. Not even the insects made noise. Wide awake now, I reached for the key, started the engine and shifted out of ‘park’. That’s when I saw it – the road that lead to the old cabin. I was parked on it. I began to pull away and the car stalled. It never stalled. I turned the key, the engine roared into life. Once again, I eased down the shifting lever, stepped on the gas pedal. The tires spun and the car swung sideways. When it stopped, I was looking into the dirt road. I sat, staring into that dark tunnel. Something was propelling me, or the car. “Okay. The car doors are locked, I won’t get out – just drive ahead a few feet.” “I want to show you guys something really neat. I found this old cabin a while ago. We could come here and have parties. Have ta clean it up some, y’know – probably got animals living in it. It’s kind of falling down in spots – have ta be careful.” Bill’s voice, hollow, coming from that place in my mind. The road curved, light glinted through the trees. The sun was high and warm that day as we barreled through those woods. “Almost there. Look! You can see it – right between those trees!” Right between those trees. I came out in a clearing, bright in the moonlight. There it was, just like that day from my past. The cabin sat forlorn, it’s back to the woods, its front looking at me, waiting. The feeling came rushing back – squeezing my throat, making it hard to breathe. The door yawned open. I felt it pulling at me, like it did before. I wouldn’t go in. I didn’t want to go in then, either. “C’mon Sara. You’re such a chickenshit.” Donna, trying to get me out of the car. “Maybe we’ll just leave you home next time. Jeez. It’s just an old, broken down cabin. Probably nobody lived in it for a hundred years. You baby!” I watched them all go inside. I felt miserable. They were right. Just a cabin. So I got out of the car and walked toward the steps leading up to the small porch. When my foot touched the bottom step, the first vision came. I was going to walk into a living room, then into a small kitchen through a doorway at the far end of that living room. There would be a sofa along the left wall – plaid, with rounded arms, across from a long wooden table centered between two windows. Then came the color – red, bright – and wet. I really didn’t want to go in. “Come on!” Donna poked her head through the open door. “ Jeez. I’ll never be able to live this down, y’know. Why do you have to be like this? There’s nothing inside ‘cept broken down furniture. It’s really neat. We could maybe form a club and this could be our club house. Betcha nobody even knows it’s here. Will you come on?” She whirled around, disappeared behind the door. I followed, reluctantly. Inside everything was just where I knew it would be. There were two floors. Narrow steps lead up to tiny bedrooms under a low ceiling. Not much – more of a loft than a second floor. Downstairs in the kitchen a wooden table lay on its side, one leg missing. “Somebody knows it’s here,” I said, pointing to cigarette butts in the corner. “They been there forever,” Donna said. “The only thing here is animals… hey! I got a great idea. Let’s spend a night here! We could bring food, sleeping bags … it’d be a kick!” “We can’t do that. Our parents would never let us.” “Oh Sara, we could too. Just tell them we’re sleeping over each other’s house. You know they don’t check any more. We been doing that forever anyway and besides, I’m sixteen now. That’s almost grown up. ‘N so are you. Hey guys!” She let out a shriek and left me standing there. She didn’t have to convince anyone – they all loved it. Maybe I could get sick. The trunk had as much junk food as would fit between the sleeping bags. The four of us – Bill, Donna, Jeannie and me – we had been here twice now and the cabin was as clean as possible, considering the shape it was in. We carted the food inside and piled it in the middle of the small living room. Next in came the sleeping bags, which we spread on the floor in a circle. Weak sunlight was streaking low and long through the window, causing dust to float around us. “Anybody want a beer?” Bill’s voice came from outside, the last word punctuated by the heavy sound of his booted foot. He stepped through the doorway, grinning, looked at each of us in turn. The light did something to his mouth – broken teeth, that’s all I saw. No one spoke for a moment, then Donna reached for the bottle in his outstretched hand. That’s when we heard it. Upstairs something fell. But it was the sound – half moan, half growl – pain, or anger – not quite human. The quiet that followed sent chills through me. We all stood there staring up at the dark opening. I don’t think anyone was breathing. I remember the wind starting, just a breeze, then harder. It came through the window, caught the door, slammed it behind Bill. It was getting dark and we didn’t have a flashlight. I know, because we looked on the ride up. It got dark so fast that long-ago night. We were all together and then there was only me. Where had they gone? The door was slightly open now and the cabin wanted me. It had waited all these years. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched as I stepped out of the car. My imagination? Probably just the darkness. I pulled the old wooden door open. Cre-e-ech! The noise, right out of a sci-fi movie. I turned on the flashlight and made myself look inside. “I must be nuts.” Shoulders back, I shone the light farther into the room, stepped inside. It was empty. A slight breeze tickled my legs and I pulled the door closed, remembering Bill’s grin and broken teeth. “Enough! Breathe – in, out – in, out…” My pulse slowed and I shone the flashlight up the stairs. The beam created weird dancing shadows on the dark wall. “What is up there? Did I go upstairs that night? Why can’t I remember?” I walked into the kitchen and it, too, was empty. Back in the living room I again looked up the stairway. Low ceilings, dirty walls – I raised the light beam higher. That’s when I saw the color. Red. Smeared, like finger painting. It came out of the room, ended halfway down the staircase. Blood. The flashlight slipped. Pulse racing, I raised the light. A shadow passed through the beam – fleeting, gone. Adrenaline pumping, I turned, yanked open the door and ran for the car. My fingers were shaking so badly I dropped the keys twice before I could get them into the ignition. The engine screamed, I jammed the shift lever down. The car shot backwards. “Shit!” I drove the brake pedal to the floor, shoved the lever back up and hit the gas pedal hard. The quiet that filled the small space was louder than the engine had been. And then I did it again. This time the only response was the feeble turning of a flooded engine. That’s when I knew. I was going to spend the night here looking at the yawning mouth of that cabin. And whatever, or whoever, was inside would be looking back. I locked the doors, reclined the seat slightly so I could see outside – just in case. “I won’t go to sleep, just rest. When it turns light the car will start. If it doesn’t I’ll walk!"" … 1908… There was just the two of them – a women and a little girl. The woman was pretty – soft oval face and blue eyes – Sara’s eyes. Her clothes were different – from a time gone before. Dark hair piled on top of her head, she was wearing a long dress that swirled around slender legs. The bodice had small buttons that stopped just beneath her chin. She stood, shading her eyes, looking toward the forest. “Jennie!”… a pause… “Jennifer Sarah! Where are you?” “Here, Mama.” The little girl came running from the woods. Her small face was ringed with curls and long dark braids bounced behind her as she ran. Jennifer Sarah was eight years old and loved everything she came into contact with. Animals would come up to her as if she was one with them. “Jennifer, I told you not to go in those woods. It isn’t safe. Why don’t you ever listen?” “It’s okay Mama. Really. Just animals and they like me. Can we go now?” She was standing on the porch of a small cabin nestled in the trees as her daughter, the only thing in life that mattered, narrowed the space between them, finally wrapping herself around her mother’s legs. She laughed and hugged the little girl. “Yes - I need a few things in town. You sit here while I hitch the horse up to the cart. Don’t you run off – I don’t want to be looking for you again. We need to go so we can get back before dark. Okay?” “Okay.” She smiled her consent up into her mother’s eyes. … 1988… In my dream the clearing was sunlit and the cabin looked new. A slight breeze moved a wooden rocker that sat on the porch. A row of yellow flowers bordered both sides of the steps. A few feet behind the cabin, by the woods, stood a small structure with one door. Awake now, I was looking at a cabin that was old and in disrepair – standing alone in the overgrown clearing. The daylight seemed to stop at the edge of the woods. “I should just leave.” It crossed my mind, but my hand was already opening the car door. They used a horse and wagon in my dream. There was no electricity and no running water, so there must be a well someplace. My great-great grandmother had lived in a place like this. Something had happened to her. I felt it, but it wasn’t clear. Like the memory wasn’t mine, but was in my head. I straightened my body and began the walk toward the woods. The path appeared soon after I entered the shaded glade. I moved slowly, ready to turn and run – just in case my legs refused to obey. Farther in, I could see a space that looked brighter where the path went around a tree. And I knew what I would find. Graves, most of them marked with crude moss-covered stones. All except two mounds, marked with wooden crosses that had the remnants of what was probably names scratched on them – now mostly illegible. I stood looking around this small open area. Something was wrong. It should have been overgrown but it was neat. There were no weeds between the graves. I couldn’t stop looking over my shoulder as I walked out of the woods. When I reached the cabin I didn’t hesitate. I knew I would go in, climb the stairs and look in the upstairs rooms. They held the key to whatever happened, and I had to know. Now it felt different inside – almost like…coming home. When I looked around the living room I could see the sofa with the round arms and the table across from it. In the kitchen, I stood still, closed my eyes and inhaled deeply. Food. It was on the long shelf and there was a woman standing with her back to me. She turned and smiled at me. I reached out – she was so close. When I opened my eyes, the room was empty. I had the strangest feeling that I had lived here once. I didn’t believe in reincarnation – but now… A friend had given me an exercise – a way to help me remember things I buried in my mind. “Sit in a quiet place, close your eyes, let your thoughts flow. Never dwell on one memory. Go backwards, ever backwards.” The idea was to take me back to places time had blurred. It had worked for me before, why not now? I retrieved a blanket from the car, spread it out in the kitchen below the window and made myself as comfortable as possible. I closed my eyes, let my mind drift. Family – Mom – the last get-together with Grandmother Jen before her death. Conversations about the past. Dad’s frowning face. I wanted to stay up that night but mom insisted I go to bed. I couldn’t sleep. I got up, crept out to the landing, crouched in the corner. I knew I must be very quiet. Mom would make me go back to bed if she caught me. Soft music drifted up the stairs, then my father’s voice. “Don’t bring all that old stuff up again, Evie. What good can it do?” “I didn’t bring it up. Mom did and she likes to talk about it. The past is the only thing she can remember clearly – she can’t even remember getting up this morning. Let her talk. What can it hurt?” “Well you certainly don’t want Sara to hear this stuff. She has nightmares as it is. Imagine her hearing about a family murder. We’d have to put her in therapy. Besides, no one ever knew for sure what happened. He just disappeared.” “Sara’s in bed, Ken. She’s been up there almost an hour and it doesn’t take her long to fall asleep.” I could visualize Dad looking up the stairway and I almost went back to my room, but curiosity held me. A murder? In our family? “Evelyn, you have to make sure you write all this stuff down and keep it”. Grandmother’s voice. “It’s our family’s history and Sara has a right to know. And I can too remember getting up this morning.” Her voice had a hurt quality, rarely heard from this once strong woman. “I’m sorry Mom – I didn’t mean to hurt you.” “Well, you did.” Grandmother’s voice shook. Everyone knew she was forgetful and hard of hearing. Normally she missed a lot of conversation. Not that night, though. She spoke again. “I think it’s colorful, that’s what I think. Well, most of it anyway. All that other stuff – about a spirit – I don’t believe any of it. Besides, none of the family even knows where that old place is.” I jerked upright, reflection broken. “That’s why this is so familiar! My great-great grandparents lived here! How in the world did I ever end up here – of all places!” Goose bumps raised on my arms. The past had somehow pulled me here, to this cabin. A horrible thing had happened – and I was meant to know. I wouldn’t give up. I leaned back, closed my eyes again. Grandmother Jen’s voice. “Sara was named after her you know – your great grandmother, only her name was spelled with an ‘h’ on the end.” “I know, Mom.” “It was tragic, really tragic. My mother watched my grandmother endure so much. That night – all the noise up there. Mother tried to ignore it. After a while she just couldn’t take it any longer. She told me all of this before she died. I can still see her face when she was telling me – it looked like she was back there. Grandmother sat her down and told her not to move, then ran out of the kitchen and up the stairs. The next thing she heard was screaming, screaming, scream…"" … 1908… Her mother was screaming. Something was wrong. She ran up the stairs, into the bedroom. Her father was hitting her mother and she was bleeding. Jennifer yelled at him to “Stop, stop, stop. You’re hurting Mama.” There was a revolver lying on the bed. … 1988… When I opened my eyes I was standing in the middle of the empty bedroom. Empty of everything – except… I felt it – an energy – pushing into my mind. A pressure that built in intensity, invading my head. I had to get out of this room! My feet wouldn’t move. I was smothering – there was no air! It took all of my will power to break free. I ran down the stairs, straight through the doorway – yanked open the car door. My foot was on the gas pedal even before I sat. I jammed the pedal down, twisted the ignition key. The engine screamed, roared into life – died. Before my mind caught up with my actions I did it again – this time, to silence. I sat, my hand still twisting the key, my foot on the gas pedal, tight to the floor. Finally I made my body relax, put my head down on the steering wheel and closed my eyes. Deep breathes, over and over, until the pounding inside my chest slowed. “I have to stay.” In my mind I knew that if I left now, whatever was in that upstairs room would never rest. “One more night. It’s the cabin – it wants me to know. I’ll do the exercise again. I’m close and I can do this. I can! I will!” I sat in the safety of the car a little longer, then got out and returned to the cabin. There was no feeling here in the downstairs rooms. I stood looking up the stairway, slowly started the climb. The feeling began when I was almost at the top. “Wait! Not yet. Later. I’ll come up later.” Outside once more, the sweet scent of pine filled the warm air. Noises of the forest and the sounds of life beyond my vision soothed me. I sat on the steps, let my body relax. In the back seat of the car there was water and a few Granola bars. I carried these, along with another blanket, inside the cabin. The night ahead would be long. The day passed slowly, and yet it seemed twilight came too soon. Stretched out on the blankets I watched the shadows grow longer. Now, there was only weak light shining from the pale moon as it rose above the trees. I closed my eyes, drifted – lulled by the songs of the night creatures… … 1908… “Here, take it.” He was holding the revolver toward her. “You need to know how to use it. We live in a place where it’s possible to get hurt, either from animals or people who want to take what you have. You have to be able to defend yourself.” Jennie took the gun out of his hand very gingerly. “I don’t like guns, Papa. ‘Sides, animals won’t hurt me – I’m their friend.” “Well maybe all of them don’t know that.” “It’s heavy and I’m scared.” “Jennifer, once you know how it works you won’t be afraid of it. What if your mama and me are gone and somebody comes to the door. What would you do? You know not everybody is good.” She looked at her papa and knew what he was talking about. After all, he wasn’t so good all the time. He hit her mama. “I could run and hide” this, timidly. “That might not work. You could be found. Now c’mon. You never have to touch it unless you feel scared and we’re not home. Or maybe I’m not home and someone is trying to hurt Mama. You could help her. Your mama and me – we don’t want anything to happen to you…"" … 1988… Thump! Upstairs. It invaded the dream. I woke holding my breath. Thump!! Fear – a bolt of electricity. It started at the top of my head, shot down my body. “Sarah. Sarah! Come up.” The words, in my mind. Low at first, then urgent – coming from that upstairs room. I didn’t move, couldn’t breathe. The words came louder. I stood on legs of rubber. “If I don’t move maybe it’ll…” The sound grew louder still, as if reading my thoughts. I forced myself to walk, stopped at the bottom of the stairs. When I looked up, that doorway looked like an open mouth, waiting to devour me. I backed up. “Sarah!!” My legs gave way and I sat, hard. The sound was a wailing wind, crashing into my mind, breaking barriers, opening passages into forgotten places. I moved forward, then upward until I reached the top of that long, long stairway. What little moonlight there was stopped just outside the bedroom door. The dark inside was an abyss of pure evil. I crossed the threshold. “I’m here. Who are you? Where did you come from? What do you want?” He spoke inside my head. “You know who I am. I pass into the minds of males. That’s why I brought the man here. When it’s time, I discard their bodies.” “Did you hurt him – hurt my friends?” “No, he did, the man named Bill. But I helped him bury them – showed him where. He is still waiting.” “What do you mean…” I grabbed my head as the sound, deafening, burst into me. “NO MORE QUESTIONS. Now you will listen. What she did was not right. She wanted the child all to herself – she wanted me to go. She had to be punished. She would have learned. The three of us could have all been together as a family. She couldn’t see it was her that was wrong – she should have taken her punishment. But no! She chose to end me! She killed me! You were too young the last time, but now you are back and you are one with her! You must pay for her sins!” His voice filled my head, circled around and around, words echoing, growing louder, louder… Then I was on the floor. The push felt like the force of a gale. I was lifted, flew through the air, hit the wall, fell. He came again and I rolled. The noise of his rage sliced through the cold air as he pushed. I hit the opposite wall. The doorway, lit by pale moonlight, penetrated the haze in my mind. I rolled toward the light. Before I reached it, I was airborne. Stunned, disoriented – I knew I wouldn’t last much longer. The next time I felt him coming, I tensed. When he lifted me, I dove out into the hall. His rage, a crescendo, roared behind me. I pulled myself out of the room and half crawled, half fell down the stairway. At the bottom I lay still, eyes closed, my mind – reeling. And there was silence, blessed silence. Moonlight was shining through the window and the feeling of rage was gone – for now. I stood up, reached for the outside doorknob, turned it. Nothing happened. With both hands wrapped around that knob, I twisted and yanked. It was stuck. I would have to climb through a window. The only one large enough was in the kitchen. I reached for the partially open top window, pushed it up all the way. With my hands on the bottom sill, I started to lift myself. Something slammed down onto the back of my hand – the pain, excruciating. There was nothing in the window. I held on to the ache, reached up again. The same thing happened. This time the pain floored me. I cradled my hand, rocked back and forth. It felt like it was smashed. And I realized I would not be allowed to leave until this – whatever it was – was finished. There was no rage downstairs. I sank down onto the blanket. It would soon be daylight – then I’d figure it out. Sun on my face woke me. I felt disoriented, achy. The night’s events came quickly back and I raised up on one elbow, winced, lay back down. My body did not want to move. Through half-closed eyes I gazed out at the expanse of floor – uneven old floorboards – like wood gets when there’s too much water… I sat up, suddenly wide awake. The floorboard in the corner. It was slightly higher than the others, as if it had been taken up and put back into place – but not quite. Probably nothing, but I walked over, ran my foot across the top. It was raised high enough to be over the side of my shoe. I reached down, pulled on the board. It didn’t move. Upon closer inspection, I could see pry marks. I pulled up again, with no luck. “Probably just old wood.” I went back to the window. Where it had been open last night, it was now closed. I tried pushing it up but it wouldn’t budge. The front door produced the same result – still stuck. The cabin was very quiet. When I looked up the stairway, the entrance into the bedroom was dark. “There is no way I’m going back up there! I have to get out of here. There should be another door to the outside.” But there wasn’t. On the far wall in the kitchen there was a line. From where I stood I could see the shape – like that of a small arch. I ran my fingers along it. Maybe this was once an exit. The raised floorboard again caught my attention. I needed a pry. My Swiss army knife! I opened the blade, sat on the floor and slid the knife in under the highest end. I pushed down. It didn’t budge. I forced the blade down farther and tried again. This time, it moved. The next time it moved even easier. Once more and the board popped up. I couldn’t see anything except loose dirt. I reached inside, pushed the blade down into the soil. There was a metallic ‘thunk’. After a few minutes of trying, I pulled out a small metal container with a latch that hooked over a piece of protruding metal, keeping the lid in place. Inside I found a few small pretty stones, an arrowhead, a large copper button. A child’s treasures, hidden beneath a floorboard. On the very bottom there was a folded piece of paper. It was a letter, written in a child’s hand. But it was the contents of that letter. After I read it, I understood. I stood at the doorway of that darkened upstairs bedroom and felt the presence inside. The urge to run, run, run – out the door, away from here was overwhelming. But I had to go into that room – make him understand. It was the only way this would ever end. Somewhere deep inside I knew the cabin would call me back – and if not me, someone else. He would have his revenge. My hand touched the pocket with the letter tucked inside. I closed my eyes, willing him with my mind. I could feel his pull, just beyond the door – wanting, needing me to enter his realm. Without my fear to strengthen him, he had no power. “Just go in. Go in and get it over with. Move now!” The door closed hard behind me. I walked into the center of a tornado. I was lifted, spun around, slammed into the wall. “Stop! Please! Hear me! I have…” The roar cut off the sound of my voice, his anger louder than a freight train. “YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. YOUR ACTIONS SPOKE FOR YOU. NOW YOU WILL PAY!” This time, I stayed on the floor. My arm was yanked, I was spun around and around. With my free arm, I flailed out, screamed at him. “Let go! It wasn’t me! LET GO NOW!!!” And I stopped moving – the noise, now only a jumbled whisper. I jumped to my feet, raised my voice. “I am not her! I am her great-great granddaughter and YOU are my great-great grandfather and you’re trying to hurt me! NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME!” The room was silent, my anger was intense. What was total darkness was now gray – his uncertainty changing the atmosphere. His turmoil swirled around me like a great unrest – but now with hesitation. “There was a letter hidden under a kitchen floorboard. It’s from my great-grandmother, your daughter. Listen while I read it to you.” “I did a bad thing. Mama said I would feel better if I write it down. Papa was hurting Mama and I shot him with a gun. But he told me I could use it if anyone was hurting Mama. He told me I could protect her. He said I could so I did. I don’t know if Papa meant from him, but he was hurting Mama so I did. I loved Papa. Mama said I did good but it doesn’t feel good. I don’t know why Papa hurt Mama but he did – a lot. Mama took Papa in the woods and I helped her because he was heavy. Mama said God would have Papa now. I didn’t know how he’d get him because she made me come back to the house. But I snuck back after Mama came home and Papa was gone so maybe God did take him. I feel really bad about what I did. Maybe Papa can read this and he knows I’m sorry I hurt him but he shouldn’t have been hurting Mama and maybe he knows that too. Mama said I would feel better after I wrote this but I don’t feel better. I miss him and I’m sorry for what I did. Jennie” There was total silence. I stood for a moment, taking in the quiet. The room felt different, no longer disturbed. I turned, walked down the stairs. The cabin door opened and I went outside, breathed deeply of the clean air. The small clearing was sunlit and smelled like pine and flowers. Bird songs and warmth filled the air. For the last time, I went up to the bedroom. Sun was shining through the small window. As I looked around the room, I felt a sense of peace. The feelings of rage were gone, along with my urgency to escape. The car started with the first turn of the key. Once again driving towards home, my thoughts went back to the last couple of hours. “They never told anyone. Once I knew what happened, I found his grave – just a grass-covered mound with no marker. They must have left the cabin soon afterwards.” My glance went down to the tin box on the seat next to me and I vowed to keep her secret. A deep feeling of sadness swept over me. The morning I drove Bill’s car home after that night twenty years ago. So many questions, none of them answered – Donna’s family, Jeanne’s family – the police. I just couldn’t remember. The police had finally found the cabin. They came to the conclusion that Donna and the rest of them had decided to take off together. After all, they were a wild bunch and I wasn’t really like the rest of them. Time passed – their families never let go but the search ended. I’m not sure anyone really believed me, but they accepted my loss of memory. They all watched me pretty closely for a while. I remember I didn’t feel much like talking and I know that worried mom and dad, but eventually things went back to normal. I’m glad I could bring peace to great-great grandfather. There’s still gaps in my memory that I can’t bring back. Déjà vu – if I didn’t believe in it before, I do now. Someday I would return to this place of my ancestors. A quiet cabin – a great place to write our family history. Grandmother Jen would like that. … LATER… The cabin sat, in peace at last. Summer turned to fall, leaves began to drop and the winter came fast and heavy. Wind found its’ way down the path into the woods, circled the graves, rested in a small funnel over the mound by the tree line. Leaves blew into the air, the funnel turned into a swirling black cloud, reversed its’ direction. The cabin door slammed as wind whooshed up the stairway into the bedroom. A scream filled the air for no one to hear. “YOU LEFT ME. COME BACK! BURY ME NEXT TO DONNA! COME BACK! I WILL WAIT AND YOU WILL PAY FOR LEAVING ME UNDONE!!” The maelstrom thrashed around the room, screaming its’ anguish. The room turned dark. Bill’s anger – a whirlwind, entered the walls, burst through, spread outward. I woke with a start. It was warm, soft music was playing. I must have fallen asleep reading. The hour was late – time for bed. I bent down, picked up the book that had slid off my lap, stood upright. A prickling sensation started at the back of my head, went down my spine all the way into my toes. The warm room went cold. I turned, walked toward the bedroom – and stopped. The cabin appeared in my mind, door open, waiting… ",candidate00008
16,00001,unknown,"SUNLIGHT DAPPLES my eyelids. My eyes ache more than ever now, and with each new dawn I wake with dread. It is cold too, this morning. A thin layer of frost glues the edge of my coat to the pavement, spikes my hair into messy peaks. I run a hand though it, and hear, in the dead quiet of morning, soft crackles as the spikes dissolve. My nose is icy; my cheeks feel red and chapped. I sit up slowly, aware of pains that are too numerous to single out. The cold smoothness of the glass behind me is running with rivulets of freezing condensation, but it prevents me from falling. As I stretch my legs out, hearing the pops and cracks of my stiff joints, I see that the gloves I am wearing are tattered, both thumbs poking rudely through. I smell terrible, I am sure, but I have long since lost the ability to judge my own odour. I draw up my legs and hug them close to me. The city is still asleep at this hour, and I revel in the quiet. The sun begins to rise, and I imagine that it rises just for me. It is beautiful. I can never forget the desperation of my situation, but I have learned to push it away, hide it in some cloistered corner of my brain, where I daren’t yet mine. My thoughts turn slowly, inevitably, to breakfast. I smile. I have a nice smile, and I am lucky that I still have all my teeth, my skin is clear and smooth, and that my hair is not too unkempt. I am lucky that people still find in them some measure of pity, and I need that. I don’t eat all that often. You have to learn to live on very little, sometimes nothing. I read of a man who survived for over four months on water alone. I try not to better that. I stand and stretch. The sun this morning is truly wonderful. There are long, grey morning shadows, and where they land, small patches of glistening white frost. Everywhere else, it melts quickly. The street lamps flickered out two hours ago, and such is the time of year that they will be flickering back to life in eight or nine hours. My feet are still cold, and I shift them into the sun, stamping lightly. I am not happy, and yet something keeps waking me in the mornings, keeps me going through the motions of day after day. The same thing that has kept me going for nearly thirteen years. I’m not sure what that something is, but I am sure I will know it when I see it. It is waiting for me. I am standing on a pavement running the length of a quiet city street. My hair is long, my beard thick but relatively un-matted, for I comb it and my hair regularly. I am wearing tatty shoes that have lasted me for ten years or more, and here and there they are held together with strips of plastic bag and parcel tape. Of my three pairs of trousers, I am wearing my worst. The other two are folded into the bag I use as a pillow. Also in the bag are several tee shirts. Over all this I am wearing a dark green ex-army jacket that I found in a skip. It is lined with fake fur, although I am sure that was never army issue. Most of it is hanging torn and shredded like giant cobwebs. I look up and down the street. There are few awake, one or two early rising shopkeepers. I see one now, scurrying like an oversized ant to and from his shop, arms laden with fruit boxes. My mouth begins to salivate. I walk towards the shopkeeper, and as they almost all do, he keeps his head down, content to know of my existence but ignore it. I kick a soft drink can down the road in front of me, and it isn’t until I hear the muted rattle of its passage, that I fully realise the depth of the silence. My breath makes soft white plumes in the air, and I walk through them. The open shop is very close now. The shopkeeper looks up and sees me coming, then looks quickly away. I think that it is possibly because my eyes resemble those of a wild animal, a wolf perhaps. I stuff my hands deep into the pockets of my jacket. The shopkeeper mumbles something incoherent, and I try to be friendly. I nod my head and mumble back. No words, just cautious sounds. I see his arm move suddenly, in a blur, and realise he has thrown something at me. Or rather, to me. My hand snatches the projectile from the air with scarcely a thought, and I break into a wide toothy grin as I feel the cold crisp hardness of an apple in my palm. It is as big as a baseball, red and shiny as fresh blood. I thank him with real words this time and laugh. I bite into the apple, and it is lush and sweet. The juice runs into my beard, but I ignore the stickiness for now. For a moment I can forget where and who I am and enjoy my breakfast. It is over too soon and I throw the core and pips into a dustbin. My hands thread their way back into my jacket pockets, for although it is slightly warmer in the sun, there is still a bitter wind curling its fingers around me. There is a bit more life to the city now. My watch has been broken for four years, but I can guess the time pretty accurately. It is around seven-thirty. I see my first car of the morning. Its exhaust belches oily blue smoke, and I watch the plumes twist and cavort in the cold air, thin tendrils reaching after the car like dead hands. I cough deeply, not liking the deep rattle that follows each hacking cough, or the moisture welling in my eyes.. The apple has left tiny slivers of skin between my teeth and I find a park bench and spend a few happy moments picking them out. The street meets with the main road here, and at all four corners of the junction, I can see the city open herself up to me. It spreads as far as I can see. I stretch my legs and drop one on top of the other. For a while, I am content. The sun warms my face and I turn to it, closing my eyes. The city is truly a magnificent place, and here is its true beauty. Here at its heart. Cars appear from nowhere, roaring past, their numbers increasing into a flowing metal stream, the faces of the drivers merging, becoming one face, parts of it content, parts irate, parts distant, as if the people have far more worry on their minds than they outwardly show. I watch them pass. The last piece of apple comes loose and I grind it between my teeth with childish satisfaction. I have been here long enough to nod off, I think. It is perhaps nine o’clock, probably a little before. The air is humming with life. People travelling to work, to shop. Ah, for those luxuries. I used to work; only now I can’t remember where. A woman sits down next to me. At least, she is on the same bench as me, but is sitting as far away as she can manage, stuffing herself into the corner and studying her fingernails as though they were priceless jewels. I turn to look at her and my heart stutters. I know this woman! I can’t place her name, but I know I was married once. Jean, or Jane. Is this her? I look again and she looks back. I see her face full on. It is not my wife. My heart is beating fast and I grin stupidly. I am sure I appear a madman to her, grinning through a thick swatch of dirty beard. She moves hastily on, as the world does. Her perfume does not share her haste, and hangs lazily in the air. It tickles my nostrils and I fight with a sneeze. It wins. I stand and turn to meet the nestling of shops before me. Which way? I choose straight on because it seems less effort that way. As I walk, I find I am thinking of the woman. Who is she? I ask myself out loud. A couple shoot quizzical looks my way but I ignore them. I must seem no different to the hundreds of babbling tramps that wander this city. My eyes are open but shock flares them wider. My heart races. I think I am wetting myself. A noise, blaring louder and louder until it threatens to split my ear drums, is drilling its way into my head. I can’t place the noise, but suddenly something snaps and it is clear to me. A car horn. I turn to my right and see the car, its grille, like bared teeth, inches from my leg. In the air is the bitter sting of burning rubber. The angry driver is yelling, but the volume of the horn has temporarily deafened me, and I can’t make out the words. I have walked blindly out into the road. Before waiting for me to move, the driver wrenches his car around me, an angry squeal of tyres. I trot quickly to the other side of the road, and rest my weight on a lamppost, breathing heavily. My heart bumps and jitters under my ribs and my legs quiver as if they are about to drop me to the floor. I feel coldness as the air hits the wet patch at my crotch. As I calm, the reality of what happens hits me suddenly. Was I really that close to death? I begin to cry as the relief washes over me. On the tails of relief follow shame and desperation. Would anyone care if I had died? I mean, really care? Still hitching breath, I manage to hobble away past shops and shops and shops. As I walk, a thought hits me so violently that I stagger in the street. What if I had been killed back there? What if the driver hadn’t seen me, hadn’t stopped? Would it be better if I were dead? I list everything I would miss, but the truth of it is I would miss very little. I force the thought away. My knees have stopped their ragged shaking, my heart beats normally. My chest feels abused, raw, but I manage to draw breath. Sleep comes easily when you are homeless, and comes easiest of all when your belly is empty and your body is drained of nutrients and vigour. I find a large tree, this one still frosted from the cold and I wrestle myself into the confines of its buttresses. My bag serves me again as a pillow and I wrap the tattered remains of my coat around my legs, which I have curled under me. My dreams are as ever horrid scaly things invading and tormenting me. I am dreaming of cars, of great shining grilles with teeth that threaten to unravel me. I dream of death and I dream of a man. He has become a friend to me, in past months, and yet I never see his face. I know I twist and contort myself in sleep, but no one cares. I am left to my nightmare. …i am standing in sand up to my ankles…it is cold and bites into me as if every grain was gifted with bristling needle teeth…wind whips around me but i have no coat…nothing to warm my freezing skin…as i look down at myself i see i am completely naked…my skin is peaked infinitely with goose-bumps… blue with the cold… there is nothing to see…the dreamscape is as desolate as i always feared it would be…dunes upon dunes of billowing sand white as if sun bleached…but there is no sun…the wind drops but the cold remains as if it is within me…i start to walk forward i think but…there is no front or back here… …north is as south is as east is as west… …up is as down… …i appear as white as the biting sand…motionless…emotionless… …a man is walking towards me now out of the distance…he has always been there…waiting… …my dream-self… …it is the friend i have had in every dream i can remember…i am jealous of his robes that drape across his wide shoulders…of the cowl that protects his face from the sand…the sand…always the biting sand… …i know that if i were to remove that cowl he would appear as i do…my twin…i laugh…he echoes the sound…his laugh is dead…flat…cold…coming across the wastes of sand…i raise my hands and he copies…i am drugged…my limbs heavy…i fight it… and it is winning… …the man beckons and i walk towards him…passing oceans of bleached sand…still the man remains distant…always the same number of footfalls away from me…he is walking away as i walk towards…and yet we are facing each other… …he stops…tilts his head…i tilt mine and i wonder who is leading who…am i him?…is he me?… …my nakedness is covered now by a robe like his and we could be as one… i draw back the hood of the robe hoping he will do the same… …as i watch the man finally draws the cowl from his own head and i recoil…unable to stop myself…it is plainly me i am looking at…the same awkward tilt to my mouth…the same deep set eyes…the same wide cheekbones and high forehead…and where my own face is bristling with beard…his is clean…no hair on it whatsoever…i see the reason suddenly…he is burned…this version of me…horribly burned so that his face appears nothing more than a pasty mass of scar tissue…i could be looking at death itself…and then it smiles at me…the scars bunching and stretching horribly around the mouth and eyes…i scream… …my own face wrinkles in sympathy and i feel i could reach right to him and pull the mask off…if i were to do so…i would see myself underneath… …i reach towards this hideous parody…expecting it to retreat but it doesn’t…expecting myself to finally wake but I don’t… …suddenly I am next to it…a reverse mirror image of it…of me…breathing the reek from it…from the glistening maw that is its face…its eyes have gone…it no longer looks human…like me…its arms are wizened claws…and they clutch at me so violently I am thrown off my feet…my lungs seize and breath is expelled in one long desperate gasp… …it reaches again for me…its wizened arms reaching higher and higher until it grasps my throat tightly…I gasp as it pushes my head down…I present the crown of my head to it…wait for the killing stroke…it doesn’t come… … it takes my skull… strangely soft… into its putrid maw… it melds to the contours of the thing’s palate… my chin is resting on its tongue and i can hear the boiling acid in its stomach… i vomit at the stench of it… i can see down the throat… down the oesophagus that is a wasted tube of dead flesh… … the pressure from its grasping hands relaxes considerably but i do not try to pull my head from its jaws… i feel a profound loss every time i move so i remain still… push my head further in… blind now to the sights and smells of it… and it begins to feel warm and soft… sensual almost… i am an infant now… the baby is crying and i know that it is crying not through fear or hunger but rather because everything it has ever known… the womb… the warmth… has been wrenched from it cruelly… because it knows that all it will experience now is pain… dirt… excretion… hurt… … i hear a deep laugh beginning in the creature’s gut… my laugh of course… as i realise who it is… who i am… … death… … and now this feeling i have as i kiss the insides of the creature’s mouth… rub my face into the soft tongue… caress the fleshy softness… i recognise it as the feeling of being born back to the womb… back to the sensual protective darkness that begins life and inevitably… must end it… … i reach my hands up and the jaws open wider to accommodate me… i start to clamber frantically inside… using my legs to push deeper… it seems impossibly big as i begin to disappear into the putrid blackness… suddenly the mouth shuts behind me and i am left in pitch blackness… i yell… hawking great lungfuls of stinking air to fuel my cries… … as a great snaking umbilical cord wraps itself around me and i writhe against its greasy pulsing length… suddenly it grows tight and pulls me in… the mouth starts to tip me forwards… i know it means to swallow me and i feel tingling anticipation… it means to end my life… or begin my death… it is the same… … i reach into the throat meaning to pull myself further in… i encounter rows of viciously serrated teeth… i pull my hands away from the pain and find them hopelessly ruined and torn… a violent tipping of the tongue and i am gone… deep… deep into the cave of its throat… deep into myself… for we are one and the same… the teeth rake at me… i am a foetus… curled and defenceless… i smell the pit of its stomach… feel splashes of the acid on my face and arms… before i die i hear the laughter again… then… nothing… Then I am awake and it is afternoon. The sun is sinking already so I know it must be at least four thirty. I stink of piss and I must have vomited in my sleep. I see there is blood in the mess beside me. I feel strange. Never in my thirteen years as this vagabond have I felt such peace. I feel terribly warm, and yet I can see from the hats and scarves, and from the frosty plumes of breath around me, that it is cold. As I stand and stretch, I realise suddenly what it is I have been searching for these years. It pops into my head as sharply and audibly as a snapping twig. I am looking for Death. Quite simply. I have lived this life of misery for too long and I am sick of it. Sick of the hunger, the cold, the thirst. Sick of the danger, the withering stares and the illness that are constant bed fellows. I am lonely and desolate, all I have or once had is gone, extinguished like a fragile flame. I have the answer now. Death awaits me, reaching to me with arms that promise peace and calm and happiness. It is so simple. I shrug off my coat and stand in the chill of the winter evening. I feel no cold. I laugh and laugh. As I walk from my bed, I slip my arms into my jacket, preferring the ease of wearing it to the clumsiness of carrying it. The air has become cold, and I can almost taste the thinness of it. The idea of dying does not fill me with the cold dread it once did. Instead, I feel a longing for the peace that has evaded me for as long as I can remember. The grass crunches under my feet. The frost has returned, and I prepare for a cold night. I begin to think of food; begin to return to the routine of finding food, eating food and finding shelter. I then realise that I have other plans ahead, and that finding food and shelter need not figure in them. The man in my dreams surfaces in my mind again, shrouded and darkened behind his cowl. I long for his final touch. I find another tree and lie beneath it. I have vague memories of trying to kill myself once. Seven years ago. Perhaps I knew then what I know now? What I desire now? Perhaps not. Stolen headache tablets, spread in a pile like a tiny snow-capped mountain. I remember the sound they made as they tumbled and clattered against one another. Swallowed slowly, one by one, washed down with a half bottle of vodka. My hands were steady, and my heart a peaceful rhythm. It comforted me as I prepared for my death. How many heartbeats left? Three hundred? A thousand? Ten? Nothing seemed to happen for a long time. I dozed and woke with metronomic regularity, and then… There was light suddenly all around me, and pain stabbed my gut like a knife. My face contorted with agony, eyes flared and mouth frothed like a horse in the throes of madness. The brightness changed. Occasional flashes of colour, too bright for me to register. My head seemed to lift from my shoulders and there was a roiling in my gut. Vomit spewed across my legs. Black in the moonlight, presumably with blood. Still my head rose and I felt I could turn to look down at my thrashing, spasming body below me. My stomach rose and fell rapidly, and with each new contortion, a fresh gobbet of vomit spattered me. My head sank suddenly without warning and by degrees the contortions slowed and stopped. Sudden blackness. I fell to my jacket and let death take me. And yet I woke and lived. And lived. The memory is now too much for my fragile mind. I am sick, violently, fall into blackness again. I become aware of the warmth of the sun on my face as I wake. I realise with some dismay that I am still alive. I’m hollowed out, like a shell, my innards wrenched from their moorings like so much crab meat. I stare at the splatter of vomit across my legs and see undigested apple littering the dark redness like stars in a dusky sky. Tears wet my cheeks as I try to stand and fall back, weakened. Death won’t come for me. I know that now. I will have to find Death. Urgency lifts me. I must do this. I realise I am chanting this mantra. I must do this. The city is alien, death everywhere suddenly. I feel like a tourist, death’s tourist, among the throng. All seems strange to me, as if I hadn’t looked it every day of my life for thirteen years or more. My head feels crushed and my neck and stomach muscles feel stretched, violated. I feel cold without my coat. I stagger across ever busying streets, mindless to the traffic, the screeching tyres, wailing horns. I walk through crowds of people that aren’t there. Dark roads lead off the main street and the perspective of the houses that line them draws me into their darkness, like a wooded path in a fairy tale. I take the furthest one from the bustle of the city. Front yards and pavements are littered with the corpses of deceased bicycles, shopping carts and old shoes. Windows in the houses nearest the entrance to the road are clean and sparkle in the sun. Further in they are either smashed or boarded over like wounds. I encounter few people. Those that I do see avert their eyes. Soon enough I stop looking at them and walk. Hunger gnaws at me pointlessly. At the last house on the road, facing me before a broken fence and miles of increasing dark, the door hangs limply open. A mattress juts like a tongue, and the windows are half lidded with yellowing net curtains. As if I have been led here, my heart quickens as I walk up the path and enter the house, the first I have been in since leaving my own The stench of the place hits me like a slap, and I reel, noticing as I do the discarded needles like a glassy snow drift in one corner. I walk in a fugue through to what I presume is a sitting room and pain flares suddenly, violently in my head, ringing at my temple. My legs collapse and I am dead weight on the carpet. A man is standing over me, a torrent of words escaping him, or so I imagine. I seem to have gone deaf and the blow blurs my senses. The pain fades as the man hits me again. I have time to study his face, pocked and drawn, a cheese-white blot with hollow eyes like burns. I see a flash of metal. The man berates me further, although I am still deaf to his ranting. I try to tell him I have no need for his drugs but he hits me again, and follows that with a flurry of kicks, surprisingly solid despite his apparent frailty. The metal flashes again and I have time to register a blade. Just. Heat blooms in my chest and I see I am skewered. Blood oozes slowly around the handle and coats the blade. I laugh. The man withdraws the knife, and I recognise and appreciate the look of horror on his face. Can I thank him? If only he knew. I try, between giggles. Everything blurs again and the pain seems unable to creep through the fug. My laughter further enrages him and he stabs me again. Pain now as the blade slips delicately between ribs into my heart. A sickening release and blood courses from the wound. Greyness edges across my vision, and my last true sight is of the man turning, dropping the knife. I watch the blood slip from its gleam as it lets go its hold on my fluids. Blackness. There is the sound of my heart beating its last and then there is nothing. No sound, no sight, no feeling. It is as if I have ceased to exist, except that I am somehow aware of this fact. I suffer a moment or two of this nothingness and then I feel cold biting wind and hear the rustle that I know is the sound of grains of sand knocking and jostling over one another. …i am standing in sand up to my ankles…it bites i as if every grain was gifted with bristling needle teeth… in front of me is… my twin… its jaws drop wide and i begin my climb into the maw once again… the smells and sounds of death affront me… and to accent them is the throb where the drug addict’s knife ended me… … i lay my head on the glossy tongue… stroke my arms wide across it… it becomes as a second coupling with a new lover… no less exciting… anticipative… but less anxious and fearful… familiar… i rub my face and torso into the floor of this cavern… i curl like the foetus i am becoming and begin sucking on my thumb… … i almost cry out as i feel the greasy umbilical cord join me to the twin who swallows me… … a pulsating movement underneath and the floor of the cave softens further… blackness begins to drop from the fleshy walls as the mouth decays around me… i sink a way into the tongue as it rots… it starts to tip me down the throat and the teeth begin their work anew… tearing me and pulling me in… … i cry out and attempt to withdraw… my arms are caught and are shredding… pain washes like fire and i scream… i manage to release myself somehow… i am free for seconds until my legs are snagged on the grasping teeth that seem to have life… my legs are stripped of skin and then of flesh as they are pulled further in… i scream again and beg for it to stop… but of course it doesn’t… not when my chest is punctured… not when the teeth reach my neck and tear at the skin there… it doesn’t stop when the umbilical tears loose… sending viscera spilling hotly down the rotting tube of its throat… … and when the pain seems to have reached its peak… it doubles and triples and magnifies by multiples of thousands as my skull is crushed by the peristalsis within the rotting tube of its throat… my brain presses against the bone briefly before being forced out through nose and mouth and ears… i moan… no longer able to scream… how am i still aware… i beg again for it to stop… and still it doesn’t… … and it swallows… finally… i boil in its acids… a fleshy pulp and still unmercifully aware to the end of my pain and plight… i have no form… only feeling… and so am forced to experience my own dissolution… digestion… excretion… this last fills me with such anguish that i scream… and scream… and scream… … silently… … once out of the creature my soul turns and watches as the creature slinks away… no longer pretending human form… i can make no sense of it… … i hang in the air over a pile of this creature’s shit… in the mess are clearly definable shapes… a femur here… ribs there… caging a domed segment of my skull… as i watch the wind picks up and the shit starts to crumble… already drying… … the bones crumble with it… crumble into dust… into… … into… … into… … suddenly it hits me… My death is nothing. No pleasures. No sensuality. It is not the comforting womb that I believed it to be. It is simply a cold, biting desert. My bones have vanished. I make the connection. I realise. If I had a heart, and it hadn’t already been pierced, surely it would burst. The creature has tricked me. This desert is death. It is nothing more or less than the powdered bones of billions of tricked souls just like me. He has shit them all out to rot and crumble among the bone-white sand. Bone-white because it is bone. And here I am too. I fear I will never be unaware. Mercy will not visit me. Or rather, us. I can hear so many others crying with me. I am no different now. My death is a grain of sand in a desert. My crying joins the cacophony and it is a horrible sound. ",candidate00006
17,00002,unknown,"""Where is everyone?"" I asked Luke, waving a hand at the empty beach chairs. I looked up and down the deserted beach. It was beautiful but there was something about the place that I couldn’t explain. A gut feeling that something wasn’t quite right. I’d caught the locals giving us strange glances. Luke laughed it off and said it was my imagination. ""Don’t you think the people are a bit weird?"" I insisted. ""Not that again,"" said Luke, hurling a pebble into the pounding surf. ""They seem friendly enough to me."" ""I can’t quite put my finger on it,"" I added. ""It’s something about the way they look at us…"" ""Don’t forget whose idea it was to come here,"" he cut in. ""Okay martyr."" I pulled a face. ""Don’t rub it in."" I’d pestered to come when I spotted the ferry crossing. We’d come to America’s Gulf Coast to play golf and it was tough luring Luke away from the fairway. But I’d won him over. Now I had to admit Plunkett Island wasn’t the idyll I’d hoped for. ""Look at that."" Luke pointed towards the water. I squinted and shaded my eyes with a hand against the sun. A shoal of silver fish jumped several feet in the air, their bodies flashed like hundreds of mirrors. I caught my breath as a shark burst from the water and devoured several fish in mid leap. Sparkling spray cascaded off its torpedo-shaped body before it crashed beneath the swirling surf once again. Luke gasped. ""Phew! That was something. Where’s the camera when you need it."" He fished in his rucksack but his head jerked up when I squeezed his arm. ""Hey, do you mind…Wow!"" Scores of fins appeared as shark after shark surfaced like a fleet of submarines. They frenziedly thrashed the water as they crunched the silver fish with awesome jaws. ""Christ!"" said Luke, suddenly grim faced. ""There could be people swimming and surfing in the bay. We better warn them."" He started running, his hand like a vice around my wrist as he pulled me along behind him. Crossing the dunes we almost stumbled over a couple lying kissing and cuddling on a beach towel. The man swore and leaped up. He glared at Luke. ""Are you crazy?…."" he started. ""Sorry,"" Luke interrupted him, ""but we have to warn people."" He nodded towards the water where the sharks were swimming towards the bay. In the market place overlooking the bay, a brass band played. People crammed the area, which was surrounded on three sides by pretty white-washed and pink-washed buildings. Several narrow winding streets led from the market place up the hill to the small town of Plunkett. The streets were also heaving with people. When we’d set off for our early morning walk the market place was empty but now it was transformed with bunting, stalls and funfair rides. A yellow banner stretched from one side to the other with the words Plunkett Carnival painted in red letters. The smell of hot dogs, popcorn and pizza drifted on the warm summer breeze. Over people’s heads I could see the tide was nearly in and the beach was teeming with people. ""Over there,"" I yelled, catching sight of a blue uniform. ""You’ve got to…clear everyone…out of the bay,"" Luke breathlessly told the police officer. ""They’re in danger."" The officer smiled unconcerned. I waved an arm towards the water. ""Sharks…"" I wheezed, my heart on the brink of bursting, ""Coming this way."" He took out a whistle and blew. Several officers ran towards him. I sighed with relief. ""Take them into custody,"" he ordered, his face stony. ""What the Hell…"" shouted Luke as two burly officers seized him, handcuffing his hands behind his back. ""Let me go,"" I shrieked as my arms were lashed behind me. Luke struggled in vain. ""We’ve done nothing wrong."" ""We came to warn you…"" I paused as a fat sweaty man, puffing on a fat sweaty cigar came up. A heavy ornate chain hung around his neck. ""Thank God,"" I cried. ""Mr. Mayor, sharks…"" He waved his cigar to silence me. ""I know,"" he said, then turned and whispered to a police officer standing beside him. His white shirt, splashed with perspiration clung to his fleshy back. ""Let me explain."" ""There’s no time,"" insisted Luke. "" You’ve got to get everyone off the beach. There’s hundreds of sharks heading towards the bay."" ""Hundreds and then some,"" said the Mayor, mopping his forehead with a white handkerchief. ""They come every year and we hold this carnival to welcome them."" Luke stared at the Mayor confused. ""What the Hell are you talking about?"" ""We thank them for leaving our shores safe,"" explained the Mayor. ""Sharks plague our coastline, exhausting the fish stocks and attacking anyone who goes into the water. Our ancestors culled them but no matter how many they killed, they still came."" He smiled warmly at us. Luke frowned angrily. My nerves began to tingle. ""So our ancestors made a pact with them,"" he went on, the rivers of sweat he’d missed with his handkerchief ran down his bloated face. ""Once a year, we allow them to gorge themselves on our fish supplies and in return we honour them in a special ceremony."" Suddenly the hairs prickled on the back of my neck. ""How?"" I asked nervously. ""Sacrifice."" I looked at Luke. His face had whitened. ""Sacrifice. Sacrifice what?"" he demanded. ""Cows, sheep?"" The Mayor smiled crookedly. His eyes vanished into two plump pillows of flesh. ""Tourists."" ""What!"" I said in a strangled voice. Luke looked incredulous. ""You’re mad."" ""Tourists aren’t encouraged to come here,"" continued the Mayor, ignoring him, ""but over a year quite a few do make their way to our little island. So we keep them here until Carnival Day and then…"" ""That’s ridiculous,"" mounting panic made my voice shake. ""They have families, jobs for God’s sake. Someone would miss them."" ""You’re absolutely right little lady,"" he said, his wet face smiling. ""We tell their families they died in a shark attack."" He laughed, his cigar breath making me recoil. ""Which is the truth."" There was a huge cheer. Over the crowd of bobbing heads I saw the sharks coming closer. ""I think our guests have arrived."" The Mayor signaled to the police officers. ""Look. You seem like a really nice couple and your act of public duty is commendable. But unfortunately you’re timing sucks. What can I tell you – you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time."" Several officers grabbed us and dragged us towards the beach. ""Let me go you bastards,"" I screamed. ""Don’t freak out, Pru,"" shouted Luke, ""This has to be a mistake."" I kicked and struggled and screamed for help to the crowds all around us but they ignored my cries. The grown ups smiled while children licking ice creams and lollypops waved with depraved unconcern. I could see the man and woman from the beach being dragged away in front of us. This couldn’t be real. I would wake up any second. I could feel blood trickling in rivulets down my struggling hands where the steel handcuffs bit into my wrists. Through tears of rage and terror I could see men, women and children tied to dozens of poles staked in the sand near the water’s edge. They were all blindfolded and gagged. Blood ran down their arms and legs where someone had slashed their skin. ""This is insane,"" I cried in horror and lashed out with my feet. I had the satisfaction of hearing one of my captors cry out in pain. Then everything went black as a cloth was put over my eyes and mouth. Ropes were lashed around my torso tying me to one of the poles I’d seen staked in the sand. Then I felt a sharp pain as something sliced through my arm and leg. ""God this can’t be happening,"" I shrieked into the cloth covering my mouth. It seemed like a lifetime that I was tied there, my heart hammering in my chest before I felt water lapping at my feet, then my knees. I could hear the bloodthirsty crowd screaming and chanting. And as the water reached my shoulders I felt something bump my side. I knew it was a shark. ""Dear Mother of God!"" I prayed for superhuman powers to escape. Suddenly the crowd’s excitement exploded. But the surf battering my body drowned their screams out. I felt the water rush around my legs, then an excruciating pain. I heard a bone snap. ""No, no,"" I screamed, frantically waving my arms to fend off the next attack. ""Pru, it’s OK."" Luke took the bedside lamp I was about to hit him with from my grasp and cradled me in his arms. ""The sharks….""I sobbed. Luke stroked my hair. ""There aren’t any. It was a nightmare."" ""No. No, stop them."" ""Jesus. Those shark pictures we saw in the restaurant last night must really have upset you."" I slumped back on the pillows, drenched. It had seemed so real. I shuddered. A long shower energised me. We got dressed and after breakfast left our hotel on one of the side streets off the market place. Clusters of excited people passed us, hurrying towards the market place. ""I wonder what’s up,"" said Luke. ""Sleepy Plunkett seems to have suddenly come alive."" We followed the stream of bodies. The slight breeze carried the sound of a brass band. ""Great. It sounds like a fair or something,"" said Luke, pulling my arm. ""Just like in my dream,"" I whispered, my mouth suddenly dry. A picture of a shark flashed into my head. Its mouth was pulled back in a terrifying grimace, revealing a necklace of jagged teeth. A black lifeless eye stared at me. ""Luke let’s go back to our room."" ""Silly. It looks like fun."" Reluctantly I followed him. The soles of my trainers seemed lined with lead. In the market place people were milling around dozens of stalls. A little girl squealed with pleasure as a man gave her a teddy bear. ""See, nothing to worry about,"" said Luke, kissing my cheek. ""Everyone’s having a good time."" I sighed. He was right. Stupid dream. I wasn’t going to let it spoil my day. A woman by the ice cream stall turned and I gasped. It was the woman from the beach I’d seen in my nightmare. Her husband finished paying for the ices and took her arm. ""Pru,"" Luke was shaking me. ""What’s up? You look like you’ve seen a ghost."" Several police officers grabbed the couple. The woman screamed and dropped her ice cream. ""What the Hell’s going on?"" said Luke. Waves of terror gripped me. I stood mesmerised, no fight in me as my arms were pulled behind by rough hands. I heard the click of handcuffs and felt the familiar cold metal against my skin. Luke was yelling but his voice seemed far away. I was barely aware of being led to the stake or the blindfold and gag being put on. The pounding in my ears muffled the crowd’s delirium. I sensed the sharks closing in. Sick rose in my throat and I retched as it hit the gag. Numb with shock, I didn’t feel the first bite. As razor-like teeth continued to rip through flesh and bone, like a hot knife through butter, I screamed but the sound was drowned in the rough fabric. ""Help. Oh God help me, please help me."" Somehow my tortured screams had got through the gag. No. Someone had removed it. Thank God. A hand that smelled like soap covered my mouth. ""Pru…Pru…please…stop. Someone will think I’m murdering you."" My bonds had been removed. I struggled frantically. ""For the love of God, Pru."" Two sharks were fighting over me, pulling me limb from limb, like snarling dogs battling over a juicy bone. My eyes flew open and Luke’s face swam in a blur before me. He was shaking me. ""What…where…Oh God!"" ""Darling, you’re going to have to lay off the late night snacks. You had me scared to death."" As Luke showered I lay on the bed, turned to ice, unable to move and unwilling to try. He’d opened the window and a breeze made the red and white curtains sway. The pattern moved like blood gushing from severed limbs. I shuddered. The sun flooding the room promised another glorious day. My teeth wouldn’t stop chattering. I couldn’t bear another night in this place. Once I’d made the decision. I was on the way to feeling better. When Luke came out of the bathroom, toweling his hair, I was stashing clothes into our two suitcases. ""What’s going on?"" ""Baby, if we hurry we can make the nine o’clock boat."" ""But we’ve paid for another night."" ""I don’t care. This place gives me the creeps."" I was wrenching open drawers like a burglar. I tossed an armful of socks and underwear into the smaller of the two cases. ""Please hurry, Luke."" He came across and grabbed my hands. ""Don’t you think you’re over-reacting?"" ""No. No. We have to get out of here."" ""After all the fuss you made to come."" I snapped the first case shut and faced him. ""Wouldn’t you prefer to play golf?"" I’d said the magic word. ""Okay. If that’s what you want. You know I only want to please you."" I reached up and kissed him. ""Thanks darling. I love you. But please hurry, we’ve only got 30 minutes."" Luke went downstairs to put the golf bags in the car while I got ready. I was tossing the last few things in the second case when he came back. ""Did the manager see you?"" I asked, sitting on the case to shut it. ""She wasn’t there. We’d better hang around until she comes back to get a refund for tonight."" ""No,"" I almost shrieked. ""I want to leave."" ""But it’s 100 bucks."" ""Forget the damn money. I’ll give you it."" ""Okay. Okay. Keep your shirt on."" We set off down the lane that led to the dock. ""Are you feeling better?"" asked Luke, as we neared the jetty. ""Yes, yes."" I lied. I was impatient. I wouldn’t feel better until we were off this island. I kept glancing at my watch. Precious minutes were ticking by. The boat we’d come across on was at the deserted dockside. The ticket office was closed. ""Doesn’t look very busy,"" said Luke. ""Where’s the crew?"" I was beginning to panic. ""Hello. Anybody there?"" A man appeared on the deck of the ferry. ""Howdy,"" he said in a friendly voice. ""How can I help you folks?"" Relieved, I ran to the water’s edge. ""We’re here for the nine o’clock crossing."" He wiped his oily hands on a rag. ""Sorry. She’s not running today."" ""Why not?"" I demanded. ""She runs every day. The sign says every day of the year."" My voice was getting higher and higher with worry. I pointed to a poster beside the wooden ticket office. ""Yep. Every day but one. But if you folks come back tomorrow she’ll be running."" ""No. We have to leave today."" ""’Fraid that ain’t possible."" Luke came over and put his arm around me. ""One more day won’t make any difference Pru. Let’s come back tomorrow."" ""No,"" I shouted. ""I want to go now."" ""As you can see, there ain’t anyone around to take you,"" said the man, climbing out of the boat. ""And in another minute or two you folks would have missed me. I was just doing a touch maintenance before getting myself off to the carnival."" ""The what?"" I shrieked. Luke looked at me in surprise. ""Pru, calm down."" ""We hold it every year, everyone’s welcome. In fact tourists are ‘specially welcome,"" he smiled. I glared at the man. ""We’re not coming back tomorrow. We’re leaving now."" He laughed. ""Well that could be a mite difficult. Being as there’s ain’t no other way off the island. Unless you plan to swim. And that could be pretty dangerous."" He nodded to the water. Hundreds of triangular fins dotted the surface. Luke whistled. ""Hey, there must be hundreds…"" He turned to the ferryman. He was gone. About a dozen people were approaching from the town, their heels kicked up puffs of dust. I screwed my eyes up in the bright sun. Even from that distance I could see the sun bouncing off the shiny buttons on their uniforms and glinting off the handcuffs they carried. As they drew closer, I could see the Mayor, one step behind his paunch, leading the way. ",candidate00001
18,00003,unknown,"It felt odd, driving into Raworth, because where I come from Raworth does not exist. I know that stretch of road, you see? It dips down to the river Warfe, crosses over by the old bridge, then rises up the dale on the other side. Ordinarily there's just a steep wooded ravine and a picturesque waterfall on the river but, like I said, on this occasion, there was also Raworth. It was a pretty little Dales village with an old fashioned garage, a tearoom, and a scattering of lovely stone-built houses. Then there was the Parish Church, a Post Office, and the Dun Bull - a white rendered, black beamed coaching inn. The first time round, I knew something was wrong but I drove on, hoping it would all fix itself if I just ignored it. I crossed over the bridge and picked up the road on the other side, but ten minutes later I was driving down into Raworth again, having mysteriously looped back on myself. So, rather doggedly now, I drove through again, only to find myself once more looping back into Raworth. It's not the first time this sort of thing has happened to me. It's hard to explain, but now and then I'll sense a shift in my frame of reference, and before I know it I've blundered into a place that seems perfectly plausible, but it's clearly somewhere I don't belong. It sort of sucks me in and holds me there for a while. Anyway, this time around I did the sensible thing, and pulled over onto the Dun Bull car park in order to wait it out. It's best not to panic in situations like this because when realities get muddled up they usually have a way of settling back on their own if you let them. This means keeping calm, because the fewer waves you make with your emotions, the quicker you'll get back to normal and be on your way again. I don't mean to sound like an expert here because I'm not. In fact I'm not sure how it works at all - if it's just that we're only equipped to deal with a certain degree of otherness, or if it's the experience of our own reality that actually dictates the kinds of places we're susceptible to falling into. Either way, there are only ever minor differences between one and the next, so you'll always find you can function quite well, if you remember to keep your head. The cars on the car park looked regular enough - a few makes I wasn't familiar with, and the registration plates were coded differently, of course, but it all seemed contemporary, and quite acceptable to my senses - no bug eyed monsters or flying elephants, or other nonsense like that. I stepped out of the car and stretched my back. The atmosphere was calming and pleasantly warm - a lovely summers' afternoon in a Dales village, down by the Warfe. What could be finer? It was seductive, and I found myself reluctant to let it go. I fancied I could see ripples in the fabric of things, a bit like the ripples on the Warfe - all sun spangled and pretty. I breathed out slowly, felt the ripples spreading, the lovely vision fading. Any second now it would be gone. It was a pity, and I wanted to hang onto it for a while longer, but like I said, I didn't belong here so the best thing was to let it go. ""Gimme your keys!"" ""What?"" Suddenly it all snapped into focus and I spun round to find a guy threatening me with a tyre iron. Could this really be happening? He was wearing a business suit and a tie, so he was not exactly your average mugger, but he was excited - the tie at half mast, his shirt laps dangling, and he was flushed and sweating. Behind him was a young woman - also smart in a dark fitted suit. She had short auburn hair and bookish spectacles. She seemed to be trying to restrain him, though without going so far as to actually touch him, as if he were somehow unclean. In such a quiet place as Raworth, all of this seemed more than a little surreal. ""No, Mr Parker,… ” she was saying. ""This is not the way!"" ""Be quiet, you silly cow!"" then to me, again, louder: ""KEYS!"" Before I could think about it, he was coming at me. My keys were in my hand. He made a grab for them, snatched them, gashed my fingers in the process, which had me backing away in pained surprise and before I could recover, he'd jumped into my car and was driving off in a cloud of dust. The woman trotted after him as best she could in her tight skirt and heels, then stood with a look of disbelief as he raced away over the bridge and up the hill on the other side of the river. He'd apparently abandoned her. She walked back to me, embarrassed, and unable to quite meet my gaze. It wasn't her fault – she'd tried to stop him, but clearly she felt awkward now, like an accomplice. Then I realised: they didn't belong here either! They'd been trying to break out of the same loop! I gazed at her in amazement, relieved it happened to others as well; it made me feel less strange of a sudden. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""He's completely lost it. If it's any comfort his car's over there."" She nodded to a big black Mercedes. ""The keys are in it. I suppose we could just help ourselves?"" ""Well, it's tempting, but I don't think it'll do us any good, do you?"" She sighed.""I suppose not."" ""How did you know I wasn't from,… well,… around here?"" ""We sort of guessed by your registration plate."" ""Ah, of course. And you thought, what, exactly?” ""Well, Parker thought your car might be different, somehow - not,… well,… cursed or anything."" ""Okay. I think I can see a weird sort of logic in that. But you should try to think of this as less the result of a curse, and more of an entanglement. I take it it's your first time?"" ""Yes. We've been here since yesterday afternoon."" ""That long?"" This was interesting! The most I'd ever managed in a place like this was a couple of hours. It was possible to draw things out for days then, and all a question of what? Focus? Might it be worth trying? This wasn't of any interest to her though; she just wanted to get out of here. ""Where did you sleep?"" ""I didn't,"" she replied. ""I sat up in the car all night - at least the part of it he wasn't driving us around the same bit of the Dales, searching for a way out."" She gave me an anxious look, wondering perhaps if I was to be trusted. ""Are you saying this has happened to you before?"" ""It's becoming a bit of a habit for me, yes."" She closed her eyes and put her hands up to her cheeks, then shook her head in weary bewilderment. ""I was hoping I was losing my mind,"" she said. ""That would have been easier to explain,… or that I was somehow dreaming it,… I mean you hear of lucid dreams don't you?"" Faces were appearing at the window of the inn. We were creating a scene, and I suspected that once the locals started latching onto us with their curiosity, it might delay our exit even more as we became ever more entangled in their reality. For myself I was in no particular hurry, and would gladly have traded places with her for a while, but she clearly felt she'd been here long enough, so I felt obliged to help her if I could ""It's not a dream,"" I told her. ""And you're not losing your mind. This is something altogether more remarkable. It's distressing, I know, but things have a way of righting themselves, so you mustn't worry. What's your name?"" ""Katie."" ""All right, Katie: For the benefit of our audience, very casually, smile like you know me,… that's good. Now walk with me."" I never thought to tell her my own name. It didn't seem worth it. We'd most likely be out of there in no time, I thought, and never meet again. I should have told her, though, but as we moved off, the moment seemed to pass and I just let it go. Parker had a real problem! His inflated ego was holding him captive, and he really needed to calm down otherwise he'd never escape, but he'd stolen my car and I wasn't much concerned with his welfare now. Katie was different though. She was a gentle soul and I was sure she just needed to be quiet for a while. By the time I sat her down in the tea shop, she was already starting to relax and open up a little, and I was sure she'd be on her way soon enough. ""We were travelling back from a conference in Scarborough,"" she explained. ""Scarborough? You were coming home by the scenic route then. This is miles out of your way."" She gave a wry smile. ""If you knew Parker, you'd understand. Anyway, once we came to Raworth, I had a feeling things weren't right."" ""I know – me too. How many times did you drive through?"" ""I lost count,"" she said. ""Look, this is just a crazy idea and don't take me seriously or anything but what if we stole another car,… a local one."" ""Wouldn't work,"" I assured her. ""You've tried it?"" ""Heavens, no. I borrowed a bicycle once, that's all. A local conveyance will get you out of the village, I think – it'll stop this looping back all the time – the same if you just walk, but that's not what we want is it?"" ""So, what do we do then?"" ""Like I said, it'll happen on its own. It's just a question of relaxing into it. As a last resort there are,… well,… techniques."" ""Techniques?"" ""Relaxation methods, maybe even a bit of hypnotic suggestion as a last resort, but I'm sure it won't come to that."" I ordered tea and scones from the waitress. She had a friendly face and an engaging smile, but this same friendliness just made things appear all the more sinister to Katie who merely eyed the girl suspiciously. ""There's something else you should know,” I said. “Where we come from, it's still the same time as when you left. And the time doesn't move, until you go back. It's like you've hit the pause button. Okay? So, no one will be worrying about you back home - if that's what's upsetting you."" This seemed to comfort her a little. ""It doesn't explain how I got here though."" ""My guess is there are slightly different versions of the same reality. Normally they're all separate of course, but now and then they seem to intersect. I don't know what keeps us fixed in one place as opposed getting swept across into another, but I suspect some of us are just less well screwed down, that's all."" ""And that's supposed to cheer me up?"" I was only confusing her now – better change the subject, then: ""Here: have some scones."" ""I'll be sick. How can you eat?"" ""It's best to just go along with things for now. And drink. You're dehydrated. You look terrible."" ""Oh? Well, thanks very much!"" After a while there came the sound of my car being driven hard. It flashed past the window and vanished in the direction of the Dun Bull. Moments later, I saw it climbing up out of the village; it looked like he was going round again. Katie took a deep breath, cradled her hands around the teacup, then took a long pull at the tea. ""Better?"" She drained the cup, nodded, and I poured her another. ""I'm assuming Parker's a colleague?"" ""Boss, actually."" ""Really? What's he like to work for?"" She wrinkled her nose. ""He's a bully and a lecherous sleaze."" ""Ah."" I had an uncomfortable thought. ""Does that explain the quiet country lanes?"" ""I'm afraid so. He's been trying it on all week. The roads are so lonely around here – I was glad to see Raworth,… I mean at first."" ""And is he always so,… assertive?"" ""Well, I've never seen him hijack someone's car before, but,… well, let's just say I'm not surprised. When normality breaks down people can revert to savagery very quickly."" ""Not all, surely! I mean, look at us. This is very civilised, don't you think?"" She managed a smile, which I found encouraging. A sense of humour is a valuable asset under any circumstances. ""It's odd though,"" I went on. ""I wouldn't have thought people like Parker were susceptible to falling through. They aren't prone to moments of detachment, you see? Me? I drift off all the time. It's no wonder I keep finding myself in places like this."" It could have been her of course; she could have been prone to it, like me, and anything she was touching or anyone she was with at the time simply came tumbling through with her. And now? Well, perhaps Parker's ego wasn't just preventing his own escape - it was preventing Katie's too: I remembered the way everything had snapped into focus as soon as he'd demanded my keys. Emotion, pain, anxiety: it locked you in all the more. My finger was still bleeding a little and I was holding a napkin over the cut. Katie seemed only just to have noticed this. ""I'm sorry"" she said. ""You're hurt. Let me see?"" She rummaged in her bag for some sticking plasters and began to apply them. She explained that she was the first-aider in her office, and assured me my wound wasn't serious. She had lovely fingers, long and slender with pretty little pointed nails, and a delicate manner that I found most endearing, but she was also wearing a wedding, engagement and an eternity ring, which triple underlined her unavailability. This had obviously not troubled the randy Parker but I was relieved by it because she was an attractive young lady, and though I had not dared to trouble myself with the fairer sex for a while now, I remained as susceptible as ever. ""Have you any children, Katie?"" She nodded. ""A little boy."" Then her face cracked and the tears began. It was the hardest thing of all: a mother separated from her child. I tried to console her. ""You'll see him again. I promise! Have you a picture?"" She produced a wallet with his photograph. He was a charming little chap, perhaps two years old, a bright smile and shining eyes. This was also bad. You needed to remain detached you see? You had to fool yourself into thinking you didn't care one way or the other if you went back, or remained – desiring anything at all, anything, disturbed the emotions and delayed your escape. Detachment is easy enough for a footloose and curmudgeonly misanthrope like me, but a young mother like Katie? How did such people ever escape these places? Or did they find themselves trapped for ever, somehow learning to adapt and survive, yet for ever feeling themselves to be alien, and grieving for the loss of the life they used to know? I felt a shiver. It was a horrible thought. My car came around for yet another circuit. How stubborn he was! He'd already spent half the night searching for a way out that he was never going to find, and now he looked set to do it all again. ""I think we're going to have to get away from here,"" I told her. ""Well, obviously,"" she said. ""But how?"" ""No, I mean Parker's attitude is preventing you from escaping. His panicking ego is sending out waves, muddying the water for you - do you understand?"" ""I think so."" ""I'm wondering, if we can make our way along to the next village, you'll no longer be disturbed by his influence, and you can make your exit from there."" She thought about this for a moment, then shook her head. ""I can't go back without him."" ""You may have to."" ""But how would I explain it? We were seen leaving a conference together. Then I turn up on my own with no sign of him anywhere, and with no explanation that anyone in their right mind would ever believe?"" She was right: that would be no good at all! I gave her a smile - no sense in upsetting her even more by telling her I was running out of ideas now. I couldn't leave her trapped here, but getting him out as well seemed, frankly, impossible. ""We may have to settle in for a while, then,"" I said. ""What? But for how long?"" ""I'm not sure. Until things calm down by themselves, I suppose."" ""You seem so calm already – you won't,… go back without me, will you?"" ""The emotional ripples coming off you are probably preventing that."" ""Oh,.. I hadn't thought. I'm sorry."" ""Don't worry. I'm in no hurry. I'll see you back safely, then make my way home in my own time."" I sought out the waitress, by the counter, in order to settle up. I'd none of the local currency, but I knew from previous experience card payments were okay and came without the inconvenience of a bill showing up on the other side. Anyway, I figured I might need some currency eventually, and asked if there was a cash-point in the village - oh, and an hotel. The cash point was by the post office, she told me. There was no hotel as such, but she said her father had some rooms for rent next door, and there was the Dun Bull of course. I took the liberty of securing the rooms. It was a holiday let and I took out a week's lease, with the option of a further week if I needed it - I wasn't feeling terribly confident at this point, you see? Then I had the task of breaking all of this to Katie. Her reaction was understandably dubious: ""I'm not sharing a room with you!"" ""It's not a room. It's a holiday apartment - more than one room, you see? Look, I know you're a married woman with a husband and a lovely little boy waiting for you, so you needn't worry, truly,… it's just somewhere we can hang out for a while, in comfort, or would you prefer to spend another night sitting in the car? "" This seemed to persuade her. ""Well, if it's only for a little while,… "" ""Good. Now, have you a suitcase in the car?… Then can I suggest you go and fetch it? Meanwhile, I'll see what cash I can draw from the machine."" I found the cash-point and drew out my limit. The notes were similar to the ones I knew - the same Queen's head, but the colours were different, and I was intrigued by the twenty-five pound denominations. Inside the post office I was able to purchase a map of the area, at least this version of it - just to get my bearings - and I was careful to hide this in my pocket, in case Katie should think I was still mulling over the idea of persuading her to leave Raworth for somewhere quieter. Well, all right, that's exactly what I was thinking. It was possible, you see, that if she escaped the tsunami of Parker's egotism, and I managed to get her back on the right side of reality again, everything she'd brought with her, including Parker, would simply follow her across in the same way it had followed her here. It was risky though - it might be different with people, and Parker's block-headedness would hold him prisoner, leaving her in the lurch on the other side – just as she had feared. She was sleeping when I returned. The holiday let was actually a small terraced house, next door to the tea room - two bedrooms, a low ceilinged living room and kitchen with gorgeous views out over the river. Under any other circumstances, this would have been idyllic. I looked in on her briefly, drawn by the ragged sound of her breathing. There was something,… I don't know,… endearing in it, I suppose. She was on top of the bed, where she'd flopped down, exhausted, so I curled a corner of the duvet over her and pulled the door quietly shut. It was possible she'd slip over while she slept. I prayed it would be so, because otherwise her situation was beginning to look hopeless. I left her a note, then went up to the Dun Bull. There, I found Parker's car and left him a message on his windscreen, telling him I had his keys and if he wanted them back he'd find me in the bar. The place was all varnished panelling and fake horse-brass. It was a typical mid-week, quiet, some families in the dining room having an early tea, some locals at the bar having an after-work drink while they watched sport on the big-screen. I ordered two glasses of the local brew, then settled at a table with the map. I felt perfectly at home to be honest - it was like being in a foreign country - an attractive unfamiliarity in the details, but underneath, it was all basically the same. I had no one I was anxious to return to, which I suppose gave me less of an incentive, but that was my problem, and I'd deal with it in my own way, though admittedly, avoiding women like the plague was hardly going to improve matters was it? I heard my car slewing up aggressively outside. I guessed it was running low on petrol by now – the tank had been nearly empty anyway, and that was before Parker got his manic hands on it. He must have read my message because, moments later, he burst in like someone spoiling for a fight and came straight over to me. I was sure he was about to make a scene, so I disarmed him by thrusting a pint glass into his hand. Then I led him outside. ""I want my keys,"" he said. It was a lovely evening, the sun settling lower over the dales, and spilling out a soft yellow light. I barely heard him as I tried to take it all in. ""What? Oh,… well, you give me mine first."" He tossed my keys onto a bench. I tossed his keys back at him, then told him to drink up - that the next round was his. ""I don't drink,"" he said, and to emphasise the point, he tipped his beer out onto the grass. He meant this as some sort of insult, I suppose, and I was dismayed, not because he'd hurt my feelings, but because I'd planned on getting him drunk. Can you think of another way of getting someone as screwed up as this to relax? I'd imagined tanking him up the point where he was barely sensible, and then pitching him gently into his own reality with a bit of hypnotic suggestion. (did I mention I was a stress counsellor and hypnotherapist?) He didn't say anything else, but he was breathing hard and his face was red with a rage he couldn't give vent to. He most likely thought I was an idiot, and simply wanted to shout at me, but he couldn't because he was still wondering if I knew something that might help him. It was also a measure of his self centredness that he hadn't asked after Katie yet. ""You really need to calm down,"" I told him. ""You're struggling against something you don't understand.” He wasn't listening though. My words just sounded strange to him: ""Who are you?"" he demanded. ""Me? I may be the only hope you've got, and I'd just as soon leave you here, so you need to listen carefully because I won't be repeating myself."" ""I heard you. I need to calm down. Well I'm calm, right? So what now?"" ""You don't even know the meaning of the word!"" It was hopeless. I could feel the attitude sparking off him, and the whole of reality that surrounded him was tightening its grip on all of us. Then Katie appeared and my heart sank! I'd been hoping her brief slumber would see her safely home – but even that hadn't worked. What on earth was I going to do with them? She'd changed into a pair of blue-jeans and a pink top. There was a delightful softness about her, which embarrassed me and I tried not to think about it because – well, she was married wasn't she? Anyway, I don't think she was pleased to see him, and he barely acknowledged her. She sat at the bench and made me feel childishly favoured when she graced me with a smile, so I was emboldened enough to sit with her. From what she'd told me about him, I wanted to protect her, though I should have covered it up better because he picked up on it in that instinctive way bullies have of discerning the vulnerabilities of their victims. ""So,… "" he said and there was something initially sinister about his grin, but he hid it quickly. He looked at me, then Katie, took a deep breath and lowered his eyes. ""It's always been a problem,"" he began. ""I know I come across as a bit abrasive, but I get results. That's what I'm paid for. I know I upset people, but it's just my way. It's not personal."" Katie said nothing. She could hardly look at him, though I was pleasantly surprised and thought he sounded genuine, even a little contrite. Had I misjudged him? Was he really the lecherous sleaze she'd made him out to be? ""Have you ever done any meditation?"" I ventured. He gave me a sneer. ""But there must be something you do to relax. Do you play golf? All businessmen play golf. There must be a golf course around here. I could give you a round,… "" ""I don't play golf."" ""Something else then?… "" He drummed his fingers on the table, and was looking intently at Katie in a way I can only describe as filthy – so maybe she was right. He went on: ""You say I need to be calm, right? Relaxed? Blissful? Profoundly stilled and all that crap?"" ""Yes, yes. That's exactly it – though plain old relaxed will do nicely."" I nodded encouragingly. ""Well,… there is something that usually does the trick."" I was a bit slow, but began to get the idea from the way he was still looking at her. It was when he said: ""So, how about it, Katie?"" that I finally got it. He couldn't be serious! Katie gave a shudder, then stood up and walked away, hugging herself. ""Dream on,"" she said. He called after her. ""Don't be like that! You want to get home, don't you? See your little boy? Well, the better job you do for me, the greater the chances of it working out for us both."" ""You creep. She was right: you're an animal."" He smiled: ""Woof, woof. Come on,… can you think of a sweeter way? It's perfect. I've been after her all week - but she's a frosty one. And I don't hear you telling me it wouldn't work – so there's a chance it might, right?"" ""Forget it. It isn't going to happen. Look there are a million ways it can be made to work and that particular thing would be the very last on my list – out of sheer decency if nothing else."" ""We'll see. This pub looks okay. Do they have rooms? I'll book myself in. You can tell her where to find me."" ""She doesn't need you. It's you who needs us, remember? I can have Katie out of here in ten minutes, and without her - you're trapped. Do you understand?"" ""Why haven't you done it then?"" ""What?"" ""Could it be that things might be a little hard to explain, if she turns up and I don't?"" ""Rest assured, my friend, we'll work out a plausible explanation for how we came to leave you behind."" I was bluffing though, and I think he knew it. ""Just send her over when she's ready,” he said. I found Katie at the house. She'd lit the wood-burner and was sitting in front of it, staring into the cherry red of the flames, hugging her knees to her chest, and rocking to and fro like a child. I had to get her out soon, or she was going to be damaged by this. ""Is it true?"" she asked. ""Might it work?"" ""Don't even think about it."" ""So,… it might then!"" ""Well, it's a while since I was last with a woman – so I can barely recall the precise details to be honest but,… . No! Just forget it! There's no rush. Remember what I said: no matter when you go back, even if it's a year from now, it'll still be the same time you left. And it's better waiting than making a sacrifice like that!"" ""But can't you feel it? The longer we stay, the firmer a hold it's getting on us."" ""That's because you're still anxious. Back at the bar, I managed to relax a bit and I could feel things shimmering. I could have let go. You'll feel it the same way, I promise."" I was lying, of course; I could feel things taking a hold of me as well – the only difference was, I didn't seem to mind any more. The place was welcoming me in with open arms, and the feeling was mutual. ""You should have done it,"" she said. ""I promise you, I've no intentions of leaving you here alone."" ""Well, there's only one way then, isn't there?"" ""No. You'd never forgive yourself. You're a married woman!"" She looked at the rings as if she'd forgotten they were there, then slipped them off. ""Actually, I've not been married for a while now,"" she said. ""I only wore them because I knew I was having to go away on business with him, and everyone knows what he's like. I thought it might hold him off a bit. Anyway, there we are. So,… it wouldn't be so bad, would it? Just another mistake with a man I should have known better than to go with in the first place."" This was getting worse. She wasn't married? She was attractive, vulnerable,.. and available,… oh, here we go again! The sooner I sent her back home the better, but there had to be another way! ""You can't do it, Katie. I won't let you."" ""You can't stop me. Anyway - what's it to you?"" ""What do you mean?"" ""Why should you care?"" ""I don't care,… I mean I do. Of course I do,… but,.."" She raised her eyebrows, and not in a pleasant way. Indeed I rather got the impression I'd displeased her, which was puzzling. She sighed. ""You don't want him to have me, because you want me yourself."" ""What? Aren't we running a little bit ahead of ourselves here?"" ""It's too late to play the innocent now. I knew it! Booking us into this place,… very cosy! And to think I trusted you."" ""That's absolutely not true."" ""I admit your approach was more subtle, and it might have worked in the end, but really, there's no difference between the two of you at all!"" Now that hurt, being lumped under the same heading as the lecherous Parker, but there was no time to defend myself. She rose suddenly and flounced away to her room, slamming the door on me. I was flustered and grumbling to myself over her ridiculous accusation, also feeling a little guilty that there might have been an element of truth in it – not that I wanted to get her into bed of course,… it was just that the thought of her company here in this pleasant old house for a while had,.. well, cheered me up a little. I took out the map because I didn't know what else to do, and I tried to lose myself in it. It was odd, looking at the land - the same river, the same hills and valleys, but different names, slightly different roads. On closer inspection though, some of the names were familiar. Burnsall Bridge was the nearest, a village a little lower down the valley, a curious pocket of semi-normality that engaged my curiosity. There was a good footpath that ran along the banks of the river, and I reckoned it was only about an hour away, on foot,… ""Actually, I didn't mean that,"" she said. I'd not heard her come back, and I flinched in surprise. ""Eh?"" ""I'm really sorry. You're not like him at all. You were just trying to keep me safe. You're kind. But why should you care if I go with him or not?"" ""I don't know, Katie. All I can say is that I desperately don't want you to, that's all. Anything that involves compromising your own morals, your own feelings, can't be right, can it?"" ""No, but sometimes, in the real world, we have no choice."" ""This isn't the real world though, is it? At least not our real world, and it seems silly to go making the same mistakes here as we do everywhere else."" She looked at me thoughtfully. ""You worry me,"" she said. ""You're too content here for my liking. There's no urgency about you. It's as if you intend settling in."" ""Nonsense."" ""Renting this house? Buying a map? That sounds like settling in to me."" ""These are merely sensible precautions."" ""I've been thinking about some of the things you've said and suddenly everything makes a different kind of sense to me."" ""Oh?"" ""If I'm not mistaken, you have a broken heart and disappointment written all over you, but escaping into this place is not the way to mend anything. Do you understand?"" Like she would know! What could be a better place to run to than somewhere none of it had ever happened? I tried to avoid her eyes but she sat down in front of me and looked at me with penetrating closeness. ""I'm right, aren't I?"" ""Possibly,… but it was years ago. It may be that I'm still sensitive about certain things and I seem to be better off on my own."" ""There's only a small part of you believes that's true,"" she said. ""The rest of you is lonely. Don't lose yourself in here – I can't think of a lonelier place to be on your own than this."" ""That's because you have someone to return to. It's all the same to me. Maybe that's why I keep slipping through to these places,… I'm unconsciously willing it."" ""That's nonsense. Why am I here then? I didn't will this. I didn't want it! What cruel purpose could there be in this?"" ""Purpose? Katie there is no purpose to anything. Reality simply is, and that goes for whichever reality you happen to be in at the time."" ""Well, I'd rather not think that way if you don't mind."" ""Okay then, let's go with your idea of a purpose: like you said: what possible purpose or meaning could there be in this for you? It's cruel."" ""I don't know yet. I'm confused about it. For you though, it seems obvious."" ""Oh?"" She smiled. ""You had to fall through in order to rescue me."" ""Well,… that's nice of you to say so, but if it's true I'm not making a very good job of it am I?"" ""I've a feeling I'm not helping much either. What do you suggest we do?"" ""Well, I think we're beyond simply trying to relax now. It's going to take some visualisation, and suggestion - hypnosis, really – nothing scary though - but I need to get you away from Parker first."" I tapped the map over the position of Burnsall Bridge. ""I was thinking this should be far enough."" She closed her eyes and placed a hand on top of mine. ""All right,"" she said. She thought for a while and seemed to come to a decision. ""I know you're not in any hurry to leave, but it's different for me. I have to see my little boy again and that's the only thing that matters. So, let's go."" ""What about Parker?"" ""I've no idea how I'll explain things when I turn up without him, but I'll think of something. I can always claim amnesia. They may suspect foul play, but they'll never find a body, because, well, there won't be one will there?"" We left the house, made our way across a meadow, and down to the river, but something else was nagging me now: If two came through, but only one went back - how did that work? There would be an imbalance surely? Time was getting short, the shadows lengthening towards dusk, and we appeared to be rushing headlong into something neither of us understood properly. ""Katie, wait,… this doesn't feel right. We should think about it some more."" ""What? But you were so sure of yourself a moment ago."" ""I know, but what if it only makes things worse? You were with Parker when you fell through – you should be with him again, to maintain the balance."" ""Balance? I don't understand, but I'm willing to let fate play a hand here. Let's just see what happens."" Then she pointed excitedly: ""Look!"" There was a rowing boat, resting on a shingle bank. One good shove and we could be floating downstream and in Burnsall Bridge in a matter of minutes! I still wasn't sure about it, and trusting things to fate didn't strike me as such a good idea, but she was already pushing the boat out towards the river. ""Wait,… this is crazy."" ""Maybe,… "" ""We could be drowned."" ""No, that would be stupid."" ""Stupid?"" “We didn't fall through a hole in reality just to get drowned in a river. That would be,… . banal, meaningless,… stupid!"" ""But it happens. People drown. There's no rhyme nor reason to it."" She was teasing the boat into the current now and I was trying to hold it back. Then I became aware of someone bearing down on us. Thinking it might be the owner of the boat, I was preparing my apologies, but it was Parker. He was breathless and sweating. ""You wouldn't be thinking of going anywhere without me would you?"" He must have been watching from the Dun Bull and was afraid of being left behind. Katie was stricken. He looked so smug. It seemed he intended keeping us close! I'm not sure how I did it, but I landed a punch in his gut, and as he doubled over I hefted him in a sort of fireman's lift and dumped him into the boat. He looked up dazed, rubbing his head. Meanwhile Katie had grabbed the oars out of the boat and used one of them to give it a good shove. The current did the rest, sucking the boat into mid-stream, carrying it, and him, swiftly away. He looked at us with big eyes, lost, panicky, stumbling about and rocking the boat ominously. I almost pitied him. Katie stared after him, horrified. ""What have I done?"" ""He'll be okay."" ""But a minute ago you were worried about us drowning in that thing."" ""He won't drown."" ""Why not? How come he's different?"" ""Because you were right. It would be banal."" ""Now you're just trying to cheer me up."" ""Possibly,… but it's too late now. Anyway – he's gone. He'll most likely wash up lower down stream. He'll get a bit wet, that's all. Serves him right. It means we can stay here now."" We sat down by the river and watched the boat disappear around a bend in the distance. By degrees I felt the atmosphere beginning to settle out as Parker's disruptive influence receded.and a comforting vagueness returned. ""Do you feel that?"" I asked her. ""Yes,… it's amazing,… "" ""And look:"" ""It's all shimmery,.. and,… oh, it's lovely!"" ""Won't be long now,"" I said. ""Try not to let it enchant you too much. In fact, you'd better close your eyes."" Then I gave her a hug, because – well – there's nothing like the feel of another human being for reassuring you, is there? And pretty soon she'd be disappearing back to her life, and I'd never see her again. We stayed like that for a while and then she must have felt herself slipping because she said: ""Promise me, you won't try to stay."" ""I promise. I'll try to catch up with Parker first, make sure he's okay. You never know, I may get through to him eventually. Then you'll have nothing to explain will you?"" Anyway, with her laying there on my shoulder, I closed my eyes too and began to murmur a relaxation script,… you are feeling heavy,… you feel yourself sinking,… She went with it quietly. I felt her draw back, and I thought she was about to slip through so I decided to open my eyes because I was curious to see what it would look like, whether she'd just disappear, or go all shimmery like everything else, but she took hold of my hands at the last minute and when I opened my eyes she was still there, or rather, it seemed,… … she'd pulled me through with her. We were two miles downstream in a little teashop in Burnsall Bridge, holding hands across a table strewn with the remains of lunch. We hadn't come far in distance but things had a different tingle to them, so I guessed we'd swapped realities again and therefore left Raworth behind. But this wasn't home. This was somewhere else entirely. Katie was wearing a cute beret and a little red woollen jacket of unfamiliar styling, and there was this kid sitting in a high-chair at the same table as us, squealing the place down while he rubbed tomato sauce into his hair. We both looked at him in stunned silence, both of us for very different reasons. I noticed she was wearing rings, but these were different to the last ones, and I was unable to shake the feeling they were mine. ""This isn't right, Katie. I'm sorry."" She looked at me, puzzled. ""It's not?"" ""It's,… I don't know. This is really weird,… "" I looked around, trying to get my bearings, and I realised I was floundering in the tide of a life I'd no sense of ever having lived. Clearly, it was a possibility – but surely rather an unlikely one! ""Why did you do that?"" I asked her. ""Do what?"" ""Pull me through like that. That's really confused things! This is,… well,.. I don't know what it is. It's like a compromise, a best fit of all the probabilities, a most likely scenario. We should try again."" She looked at the boy, her heart melting. It was definitely her child, and there was no way she'd ever leave him again. But where did that leave me? She leaned over and squeezed my hand. ""Let's see how this goes for a while. I'm sure we'll muddle through."" I tapped my finger against her rings, and raised my brows, in case she'd not noticed yet, but she chuckled. ""I know. Funny isn't it? Who would have thought it? But that was a lovely hug you gave me,… it just felt so,.."" ""Whoa, listen,… don't get me wrong, I was merely being,… "" ""No, you listen, mister: this slipping in and out of reality has nothing to do with detachment – or I could never have left him. I've not had a moments' detachment since the day he was born."" She shook her head as if she'd just realised something. ""Don't you get it. This is not a compromise. It's not a best fit, or a make do. This is the only thing that makes any sense at all,… to either of us. ""What I said about you falling through in order to rescue me: I was wrong. It was me who fell through in order to rescue you."" ""Katie, this is hardly a rescue. In case you hadn't noticed, we're in real trouble here."" ""No. You were in trouble. You had no connection, nothing binding you in life at all. You keep yourself all sealed up and aloof – I mean I don't even know your name! It's as if you're afraid of handing it out in case people can start calling you by it and interfering in your private little world. No wonder you kept dropping out of the bottom of reality! Well,… I think we can help you with that."" I noticed she had said we. I looked at the squealing child - snot and sauce dribbling down his face - and I rather doubted the pair of them were much of a solution to anything, but then she took her glasses off and made the most appealing eyes at me, and the child was quiet for a moment, beaming sunshine through the mess,… and for a second the idea seemed ridiculously attractive,… then just ridiculous. ""Katie,… that would be a really bad idea. And if you were thinking straight, you'd realise it too."" She looked crestfallen. ""Oh! Do you think so?"" ""All that stuff you said about me,… well,… some of it may be true, and if you did rescue me, then I'm very grateful, but we don't exactly know each other do we – I mean we only met this morning."" She was admiring her rings. ""But it looks to me as if we've been married for a while. How long would you say? Three years? Four?"" ""All right, it seems as if we've set down in this place already with a bit of history, which is really weird, and we've some catching up to do. But what if I turn out to be your worst nightmare? Have you not thought of that? What if I'm the husband from hell?"" She was shaking her head. ""We didn't fall through two versions of reality to wind up sitting at this table, for there to be any bad stuff between us. No. This is going to be perfect,… trust me!"" It was the craziest thing I'd ever heard. I began to search my pockets. ""What are you doing?"" ""I was looking for something with my name on it. I just wanted to make sure it was still what I thought it was,… I mean before I told you."" ""There's no need, if you're intending skipping out the first chance you get."" I could see the river through the window, and I wondered if about now was the time Parker should be coming floating downstream to interrupt us, hollering for help and creating a scene. It was impossible of course, wasn't it? I mean, Parker had never existed here. To my surprise however I discovered I was afraid he really would appear and ruin this moment, this chance of a life,… With one wary eye on the river, I said: ""Erm,… my name is Richard."" I wasn't sure how long we could sustain this, but things felt pretty firm, and something told me neither of us would be leaving here in a hurry, but I reached out and took hold of her hand,… … just in case.

19,00004,unknown,"THWAAACKK !!! The fist coming out of nowhere off to his right, connected with his jaw with a dull meaty solidness, snapping his lolling head painfully to his left and jerking his consciousness out of the little safe ball he'd put it however many hours or days ago. As his head flew around, his eyes subconsciously noted the arc of spittle and blood that spewed from his mouth in droplets of varying size to splash across the belly of another guy standing on his left-hand side. Years of training did their job, and as he registered the pain on one level, the rest of his senses sprang into automatic overdrive and catalogued the situation. He was tied to a chair in a dimly lit room. Wooden chair. Solid. But not bolted to the floor - possible opportunity there. Naked – totally starkers, and no sight of his trousers, shirt, shoes and socks in the room either. Hemp, or other natural fibre rope. Fairly proficiently tied but not expert. Still, the ropes were biting into his wrists and ankles, and chafed across the skin of his chest. The guy to his left – Bravo, was a solid looking Asian with mongoloid features, pudgy around the gut. He was wearing a white muscle shirt and Dan could see the ornate tattoos up his arms disappearing onto his chest. He could have christened him “Broken nose” but that would give him human status and this guy was nothing other than a target, meant for as rapid as possible incapacitation or elimination – the latter being preferable given the circumstances. Alpha, the guy who had punched him, he hadn't seen yet, but he figured he would also feature similar tattoos, as the feel of the hand to his jaw during the punch hadn't felt quite normal, as though the guy was missing some of his fingers. Yakuza he surmised. From other sounds, Dan also sensed there was a third guy a little distance behind him. Charlie, as he was designated, could be wearing a suit - an expensive silk suit, or kimono maybe, from the rustling sounds. Dan guessed he was standing just out of splatter-range, probably right at the back of the room given the compact size of most rooms in Japan. He couldn't quite see him with his peripheral vision but what he could see, and from what he could hear and otherwise 'sense', there weren't any others in the room. As he straightened his head to look back at Alpha, he noticed the door in front, closed of course, and a table behind Alpha up against the wall on that side. Solid looking wooden table, hard up against the wall. On its surface was a small collection of rough wooden handled knives with various shaped, but mostly small, blades. A short straight skinny one that was probably used as a skinning knife, a stumpy curved one that looked like a cats claw or upside-down scorpion stinger, and a third that looked like a hard-cheese cheese knife that would only be any good if used chisel-like – probably for removing fingers. Taken on top of the bodyguards fate, his previous 'introductory beating' and deprivation tank session, Dan mentally elevated the urgency and choice of prognosis for his targets – definitely not just incapacitation. As Dan was completing his survey, Alpha spoke. “What are you doing here?” he demanded. After a pause in which Dan did not answer, Alpha stepped in front and followed the question with a sharp punch into his belly. As the air whooshed out of him and he jerked forward against the ropes, his mind raced through one of his flash-back-memory-slideshows – like a stroboscope going off in his brain. What indeed was he doing here? Alpha had meant it a completely different way of course, but in the last week, Dan's thinking had been taking a trip down meta-physical pathways, and so, combined with the out-of-body experience of the sensory deprivation tank still clinging to his mental synapses, he visualised the question in a totally different context to what was intended and his mind ran off in a strange direction. Flash – looking up from underwater through near-death tunnel vision while Chris and Tommy desperately tried to lift the submerged branch off him near their swimming hole at age 6. Flash – shiny brass and sharply creased uniforms at their Army recruit course passing out parade at age 18. Flash – the crystallised slow motion view of his shinai bending across his Sensei's helmet for a perfect men point in the shiai that followed immediately after his Kendo nidan grading at age 23. Flash – the glint of sun off the naked sword blades taking the salute at his cadet officers passing out parade one year later. Flash – pushing through the black, stinking, body-sucking mud of Auckland's North Shore tidal estuary, every fibre, muscle and lungs straining during the daily morning “mud run” on the SAS training course at age 26. Flash – the spray of blood and shattered kneecap seen through the scope of his L96A1 sniper rifle in perfect synchronisation with Tom's shot to the other knee of the Taliban target in Afghanistan at age 29. Flash – Tom's blood burbling through Dan's fingers while trying to block the sucking chest wound two days later. Flash – tequila bottle. Flash - … Flash, … Flash, … Flash … Dan said nothing. Then Bravo stepped in with a savage swing to the left side of Dan's jaw. He knew it was coming though, and snatched at the opportunity it offered. Taking the full brunt and adding some of his own momentum to the force of the blow, he crashed to the floor and rolled, chair and all, towards the table leg against the wall. He aimed the roll perfectly such that the side of the chairs legs and armrest, smashed full into the robustness of the table leg. Since the table was firm against the wall, all the force was focused into the side of the chair, shattering the cross members and seat 'pan' to kindling. Using all his strength and adding some violent pelvic thrusts into the equation, Dan succeeded in smashing his right armrest and a couple of the chair legs free of the seat such that he could move his arm and legs. Rolling around the other side of the table leg, he came up, snatching the collection of knives off the top as he did so. While it had happened in an instant, Alpha had followed and had reached out his hand to steady himself on the table edge as Dan changed direction underneath it. At the same instant as he snatched up the knives, Dan kept moving forward and suddenly stabbed down hard with the chisel knife, pinning Alpha's hand to the table and wrenching a yelp of pain from him. Without stopping, his motion flowed into a side-step as he hurled the skinny bladed knife directly at Bravo's head. The hefty weight of the crude wooden handle helped propel the blade cleanly through Bravo's left eyeball, through the eye-socket before stopping two inches into his brain, dropping him instantly in mid stride. As soon as the knife left his hand, Dan still in fluid motion, had stepped back towards Alpha, who while still pinned to the table, was starting to reach towards the knife to pull it out, however Dan got there first, and with one carefully considered slash of the cats-claw blade, ruptured trachea, larynx and carotid arteries in a spray of blood and gore that painted the table and wall a new colour-scheme. As he stepped away from the table he pulled out the chisel pinning Alpha's hand and faced Charlie at the back of the room. Even in the moments he was dealing to Alpha and Bravo, Dan had confirmed his impression that there was only one other person behind the chair, and in the instant Dan faced him, he saw Charlie was indeed wearing a suit. Dan didn't profess to know anything much about suits, but he judged this one to be an expensive, hand tailored one, which he assumed made Charlie an important Yakuza boss. He was one of the smaller specimens of Japanese men, but he was carefully groomed, and despite having just seen his two henchmen dispatched within a few seconds from a guy who had been securely tied up, he was calm and in full control. He had already drawn a gleaming tanto out from his belt under his suit jacket, but otherwise he hadn't moved. While Dan didn't know about suits, he certainly did know about blades, and while he couldn't tell the age, he could tell that the blade was genuine, razor sharp, katana technology, and he could tell that Charlie knew how to use it. He also instantly noticed this tanto was totally different to any other he'd seen. Charlie was holding it with the slight curve held facing down and Dan saw that, unusually, the edge was on the inside of the curve. That would mean a different fighting style, probably more slicing at the limbs and neck – the small diameter parts of the body, although he could see that the 'back' of the blade was also edged approximately one third of the forward length such that it could still be used for stabbing and slicing out from the stab. Dan didn't intend to let him do any of that though. They sized each other up across the room. Since there was no immediate rush on Charlie’s part to come to the fight, Dan took the opportunity to make himself fully mobile and functional. Without taking his eyes off Charlie for an instant, he quickly but deliberately, cut the remnants of the chair from his chest and remaining limbs. In the process of kneeling down to free his left leg, he also scooped up one of the shattered chair legs. Dan knew all about the art of improvised weapons. The SAS had frequently trained to kill with all sorts of everyday objects. When Life handed Dan a lemon, he would instantly clutch it in his left hand with the stem part against his palm and the pointy end facing out, then with a rapidly sweeping cross-body blow, stab it firmly into Life's nearest eyeball. A fraction of a second after the strike, he would pluck it out and as he or she recoiled, opening their mouth to scream, he would jam the lemon down their throat, smacking it further in with a blow from his right hand, and finish off riding their body down to the floor, with his hands pressing into their throat. Thumbs crushing shut the trachea, fingers closing off the carotid arteries, he would choke the life out of them as their heels drummed helplessly against the ground. Charlie however, seemed to know his way around the martial arts scene too. He was standing in a relaxed looking pose with the tanto held in a one-handed kendo chudan, or 'middle guard' position, his feet spread shoulder width apart, right foot forward towards Dan. From here Dan knew he could equally attack or defend as required, regardless of the different aspect this particular 'knife' would cause. Dan faced him in a half crouch, with the chair leg in his left hand, and both the chisel-knife and the cats-claw knife in his right, amid the wreckage of the shattered chair. For what seemed like an age but in reality was a handful of seconds, they faced each other in the ki battle that always precedes the clash of trained martial masters. Dan could feel that Charlie had strong ki and to his partly trained eye, Dan knew he was well versed in the Japanese martial arts. But Dan didn't fight in the traditional Japanese manner when it came down to kill or be killed situations. In an instant he drew back his arm and let fly with the chisel-knife full force at the centre of Charlie's chest. As the knife left his fingers, he sprang forward and with a feinting step to his right, brought the stick up and down to his left to knock the tanto out of Charlie's hand, or at least to knock his hand out of the way. Charlie had parried the thrown knife with his tanto and took the chair leg blow on his wrist, but his hand, still clutching the tanto, was forced down and off to his right hand side – leaving his front momentarily unguarded. Instantly Dan jump-stepped back to his left and plunged the cats-claw knife, the blade held sideways, between his ribs and up into his heart. As Dan's body thudded solidly into Charlie's, he knocked him backwards to the floor, the knife handle sticking obscenely out of his chest. He didn't hesitate even then though, before smashing the chair leg viciously down on his head then reversing it and jamming the splintered end through his eye socket into his brain. First rule of war – try and avoid the fight, but once committed to the fight, crush and destroy utterly, lest you be destroyed yourself. The knife might have done the job by itself, but there was no point taking the risk that it hadn't, when you had extra weapons at your disposal. The masters of old had all said as much, and Dan believed it as well. Dan sat heavily on Charlie’s chest for a few seconds, checking for any signs of life. Satisfied, he leapt up, scooping up the tanto as he went, and moved quietly to the door where he listened carefully for any sounds of activity from guards outside. He was sure there would be guards, but so far at least, they were not coming. They must be used to sounds of violence coming from this room he thought grimly to himself. Dan quickly returned to the three bodies and starting with Charlie, searched them rapidly. Intel and weapons were the order of the day – standard SAS procedure, and old habits die hard. Straight off the bat, Charlie yielded a cell-phone – about as good as it gets as a source of info in this line of work. From this, Dan hoped to find names & numbers of associates and a call history. If he was able to make the right contacts, he might even be able to back-track his recent movements from the cell tower triangulation. For now though, he would simply use its camera function, to take photos of their faces and distinguishing tattoo's to make subsequent positive identification. Finishing his search he found the scabbard of the tanto, but otherwise nothing else of use to him. Quickly taking a couple of snaps of Charlie's face and overall body, he moved on to Bravo, and lastly Alpha, repeating his search and photo taking process but found nothing of any use except the knives he'd used to kill them. There was nothing else of use in the room either. None of the men's clothes would fit him so he would have to stay 'au naturale' a while longer. He could have made a loin-cloth for himself from one of their shirts but he didn't think his modesty was worth the time it would take. Instead he equipped himself using the rope that had tied him to the chair to make a pseudo webbing belt and harness for his gear – the tanto, the 3 knives, and 3 of the shattered chair fragments that were both hefty and jagged enough to make possible weapons. He figured that unless he got extremely lucky, he was going to have to fight his way out of this place, in which case the more weapons he had available, the better. Next he ripped off Bravo's muscle-shirt, made a bundle for the cell phone, and tied that onto the rope harness as well. Then as an afterthought, he grabbed the last remaining rag of the shirt and folded it over the rope at his waist making a hanging 'curtain' over his private parts. That would have to do for now! He took a moment to examine the tanto more carefully. The saya (scabbard) and the koshirae (hand-piece fittings) were well cared for but had the look of age. The saya featured a beautiful black lacquer wood base with inlaid mother of pearl sakura cherry blossom. The tanto itself featured a more elaborate than usual (for a tanto) ito wrap style handle and a small oval mini-tsuba, while the blade was wide, strong and with a beautifully subtle hamon over its approximate 30 centimeter length. Dan, while not an expert, was an 'enthusiastic amateur' and from his recent 'training' with sensei in the museum of Osaka, estimated the tanto was a genuine antique, probably from the early Edo period in the early 1600's, or maybe even the Showa era from the 1300's. If it was a 'normal' “edge on the outside of the curve”, it would be worth a few thousand dollars he imagined, and this one with the edge on the inside of the curve would probably be even rarer. It would be a shame to mar its perfection by stabbing and cutting, but if came to using it to defend himself, he would have no hesitation in doing so. He carefully positioned the saya in his rope 'belt' on his left hip, then taking the tanto in his right hand, and one of the chair legs in his left, he readied himself by the door. Despite the edge placement difference, the tanto was still his most effective, and therefore his primary weapon, while the chair legs would give him more reach than any of the other weapons, and would be more suited to block a blade which was one of the more likely weapons he was likely to encounter with the Yakuza, hence this was his secondary weapon. As he mentally prepared himself by the door, his mind raced back through the week-or-so it had been since his arrival, cataloguing and sifting the events to search for any clues in his memory that might assist what he was going to find out there and help him find the others. Was it sensei, the princess, or his own past that had got him into this position? ",candidate00003
20,00005,unknown,"Prina stood in a trough full of eels. She was at the top of the fish-steps on Stourmouth docks. Clean seawater would have trickled down from one trough to the next keeping fish, crabs and eels alive until time for them to be sold. It didn’t because the valve at the top had jammed so Calder the plumber had been called and Prina, his teenage apprentice, sent to climb up and fix it. Eels writhed around her calves and prodded her cold feet. Although she had hitched up her dress its hem was soaked. She struggled with a large spanner on a rusted nut. Finally it turned and of course the spanner jammed her hands against the trough before falling in the water. ‘Ouch!’ ‘That’s it girl,’ encouraged Calder. ‘Now you can take off the valve cover and clear out the rust. Saltwater corrosion, it’s the plumber’s best friend, always keep you employed will saltwater corrosion.’ Prina felt amongst the slimy snakes to find the spanner. ‘I could do with some help, this is hard.’ ‘Best way to learn, girl, hard jobs’ll help you build up your muscles.’ ‘I don’t want muscles,’ she called back. ‘I can’t climb up there, not with my joints, damp plays up the rheumatism bad.’ ‘This is going to give me rheumatism?’ ‘O’course girl,’ Calder shouted, ‘plumbers always get rhumatis, the damp gets to the bones. O’course without rhumatis you couldn’t look the Guild of Plumbers square in the face.’ ‘I don’t want to look them in the face. The Guild’s full of ugly old men,’ she snapped. ‘That’s the spirit, girl,’ Calder said cheerfully. Prina decided the rheumatism was affecting his brain. She continued taking the valve to bits and then cleaned the pieces with a wire brush she pulled from one of the pockets in her apron. ‘That your new apprentice?’ Prina glanced round to see a broad shouldered man had joined her master (like she’d ever call him that). She was going to hear those words again, the ones Prina heard every time someone new saw her. Stourmouth was a small town, eventually all would learn that Calder had taken on a girl by order of the King. To her annoyance, a month had gone by and still people found it strange. ‘Yes, that’s Prina.’ ‘She really is a girl,’ observed Ivor the Fish, owner of a handful of fishing boats. This town’s definitely got the best girl-recognisers in the kingdom, Prina thought sarcastically; perhaps it’s the long hair and the dress that give it away. ‘Yes, the girl’s a girl,’ Calder confirmed. ‘An ordinary plumber wasn’t good enough for Princess Aileen, she wanted one just for her, so I gets one of her maids.’ ‘Snooty wench. I’ve heard she treats her maids like dogs.’ ‘Dunno about that, but Prina goes to the castle every weekend happy as you like, but she’s miserable as sin when she comes back.’ Unseen Prina made some notes in a little book. ‘Need your opinion on sumthin’, follows me. Gotta keep it a secret.’ Prina liked secrets, especially other people’s. Repairing the valve in seconds and gathering her tools into her apron Prina splashed down the steps. She was moving so quickly that the lobsters in the bottom trough only nipped her toes once. Prina set off after the men. ‘Yeah, it was odd at first, but she works hard,’ Calder admitted strolling beside Ivor. Pausing behind a barrel of salt, Prina changed something in her book as she sneaked after them. ‘Not right, girls should stay home.’ ‘She can read and write, and she can do number stuff.’ ‘Can’t see a use for it, specially wasting in on a girl.’ Calder continued, ‘She’s speaks funny too, uses bigger words than a person has a right too. She’s surly too.’ The two men went into a boatshed on the quay. It looked like it was too lazy to collapse properly. Its warped planks left a million slits for Prina to spy through as she entered the alley between sheds and peered in. The shed covered a drydock. Prina found it odd that the tide was out yet the dock was still full of water. The gates that usually stopped harbour water flooding the dock were now keeping the water in. The men walked along the edge of the pool. Prina followed them slit by slit. Frustrated, she couldn’t hear what they were saying or see what they were looking at. Prina reached the end of the alley and stood at the quay edge. Beyond was the harbour at low tide all mud and boats resting on it. Open to the sea, nets had been strung thickly over the entrance to the shed. Prina peered around the edge. Ivor and Calder had their backs to Prina. ‘I’ll see what I can do,’ Calder said. Balancing on the lip between building and drop Prina nearly fell as she strained to hear. Still she couldn’t find out the secret so when they left, Prina climbed in by weaving through the tangle of nets. Something as big as Prina swam lazily underwater. Prina peered over the edge. ‘Ah!’ A girl’s face looked back at her. Prina staggered back as the head came out of the water. Expecting it to be between the teeth of a monster Prina tripped over backwards as she tried to escape. Supporting herself on her arms the head’s owner looked at her. No older than Prina, she wore a tight waistcoat leaving her arms bare and her hair was cropped. Feeling stupid Prina began collecting the tools that had spilled out of her apron. ‘What do you think you’re doing?’ Opening her mouth then thinking better of it, the girl slipped back into the water, her tail briefly appeared as she dived out of sight. ‘A mermaid,’ Prina said, ‘by the Golden Plunger a mermaid.’ Prina made a mixture of clicking and whistling noises. The mermaid popped up nearby repeating the sounds. ‘You heard me,’ Prina said, ‘Speak land-language I know you can.’ ‘Yoooou ahhh princessss?’ Even though the words were from a foreign language and no one else heard them, Prina panicked. ‘Shhhh, I’ll lose my job if anyone knows I’m Princess Aileen. It’s very important I don’t lose this job.’ Princesses learn many languages because it comes in handy for meeting princes. ‘You’re a long way from home,’ Prina-Aileen judged by the land-language. ‘I’m… er,’ the mermaid began. ‘I’m Dolphinfast Tuna-Hunter. I’m a shepherd—’ ‘Another peasant,’ groaned Prina. ‘—I was nursing a sick whale—’ ‘Stop there,’ Prina held up a hand, ‘Did I say I cared?’ ‘I’m so glad you’re here. You can get me free.’ ‘Not so fast fishgirl,’ Prina responded. ‘I didn’t hear anyone say I was going to help you escape.’ ‘You can’t leave me here,’ Dolphinfast moaned. ‘Of course not,’ Prina agreed. ‘You should be in my father’s menagerie.’ ‘What is menagerie?’ Dolphinfast asked. ‘It’s where father keeps strange animals. He has a great collection of animals, you’d really set it off.’ ‘I’m not an animal,’ Dolphinfast declared. ‘Half-girl, half cat food, sounds pretty animal too me.’ ‘You’re a Princess, you can’t do this,’ Dolphinfast argued. ‘Shhh!’ Prina warned. ‘Yes I can, a you-know-what can do anything she likes. Now, if you don’t do as you’re told I’ll have you stuffed and mounted like a hunting trophy.’ ‘No.’ ‘Yes!’ ‘What happens if people know you a princess?’ ‘I’m not going to tell you,’ Princess Aileen said. ‘Something nasty because you are being punished for being a bad person.’ ‘Maybe.’ As if trying to feed a maid to a dragon made her a bad person. ‘Princess, princess, PRINCESS! I have a P.R.I.N.C.E.S.S in here with me!’ Prina sprang up and ran for the door which opened with Ivor on the other side of it. ‘What you doing here?’ Ivor demanded grabbing the collar of her dress and twisting it into a knot. ‘She’s nosey, I did say she was nosey,’ Calder said nervously from behind Ivor. ‘I knows those words, them’s foreigner lingo. Do you speak foreign?’ ‘No,’ Prina said weakly, ‘it started babbling at me.’ ‘She’s a princess, princess, PRINCESS,’ Dolphinfast sang out. ‘I know some fishermen who speak foreign, I’ll find out what she’s saying.’ ‘Probably nothing, fish and hairstyles.’ ‘I’ll find out,’ Ivor said. ‘Now, what are you doing here?’ ‘How do you expect me to work for my master —’ she cringed — ‘if I have to go sneaking around to find out what the next job is. You’ve not been thinking this through, ugh.’ Prina found the fist under her chin tightening the cloth. ‘Calling me stupid are you?’ ‘No sir,’ Prina squeaked. ‘Did I say she was surly too? If she were a boy I’d beat some obedience into her, but of course can’t do that with girls.’ ‘It might work with her,’ Ivor said very slowly. A slimy eel of fear wriggled down Prina’s back. ‘Please,’ she whispered, ‘I meant no insult. Building a proper tank for her… er, it, that’s a big job and will need me to be involved, so why keep it a secret from me?’ ‘She’s right, I would need my apprentice.’ Calder agreed. He didn’t like the way Ivor had not loosened his grip. Prina liked it less, but it didn’t stop her saying something stupid. ‘Of course the smart thing would be to give it to the king. All strange creatures are his by law. Ugh.’ With one powerful arm Ivor lifted Prina off the floor. She struggled to get free and more importantly to get air into her lungs. Ivor brought his face to hers. ‘This is my catch. This is my way to get rich. If you say one word of this to anyone I’ll cut you up and use you for bait.’ ‘No you wouldn’t, Ivor,’ Calder said in a friendly manner. A knife flashed in front of Prina’s eyes. ‘It goes for you too plumber.’ That night Prina crept down the alley by the boathouse. After walking through deserted streets she had expected the boathouse to be dark, but light was streaming out of its sides. A rotting seaweed breeze chilled her. Pulling her heavy wooden shawl round her head, Prina peered anxiously through one of the cracks. Oil lamps cast shadows on the water. Ivor was inside and shouting. She hoped it wasn’t because he had found her book. Prina had not been so scared since she had been stuck to a dragon’s nostril. The same one that would eat Aileen if she stopped being Prina. Where Aileen was so important that Ivor would be thrown into the dungeon for touching her, Prina didn’t matter to anyone. She didn’t have guards to protect her. If Ivor caught Prina, she could be fish-food before dawn. She was risking her life to find her favourite book. In it she listed all the people she hated and what she was going to do to them when she became Queen Aileen. If found that would be bad enough, unfortunately it also had ‘Property of Princess Aileen’ written on the inside. It was normally in her apron but it was missing. Prina guessed it had escaped when everything fell out in the boathouse. Shouting even louder, Ivor marched along the pool edge carrying a boat hook. At times he would smash down creating explosions of water. ‘Jump you stupid fish!’ screamed the fisherman. Hanging from the rafters was a hoop made from rope. ‘If you don’t learn this trick, I’ll have you stuffed!’ Prina felt like she’d been poked with the boathook. Her own threat sounded worse when it came out of another’s mouth. Ivor caught the mermaid. Snagging Dolphinfast’s waistcoat Ivor hauled her to him. He said something in a dangerous low tone. Imagining the words, knowing what it was like to say them and receive them, Prina was already walking to end of boatyard. ‘I hate empathy. This is not going to help me be a queen.’ Her clogs didn’t grip well on the iron rungs set into the stone side of the jetty as she climbed down. Rising quickly the tide had covered the majority of the slipway in front of the drydock. Seawater was lapping at her heels when she looked up at the gates propped closed with tall timbers. Wooden wedges were jammed beneath the beams holding them in place. From her apron Prina pulled her favourite tool — the biggest hammer she could carry. Stooping she struck the wedge. It barely moved. Her second whack shifted it. ‘Oi!’ Ivor’s boots clumped onto the gates. His huge shadow moved across the nets. Whistle, click, click, whistle, whistle click, Prina sang out ducking behind the beam. There was a huge splash as Dolphinfast jumped through the hoop. The shadow stopped. ‘That’s it shark-bait, keep up the acro-bat-tics and you’ll get some nice fish,’ Ivor called, he was standing on the gates his back to Prina. ‘Your kind can make all the noise they like out there, but they can’t save you.’ ‘I can.’ The wedge flew from under its prop with Prina’s final whack. The tree trunk fell away. ‘Oh,’ said Prina weakly as the gates burst like a fat man’s trousers. Washed into deep water Prina didn’t know which way was up. All sorts of hard things had struck her as she tumbled with the flow. Her tool belt’s weight found down and pulled her that way. Prina thrashed. Her dress was soaked and tangled her legs. Sinking deeper into the black sea with her chest feeling like a bursting balloon, Prina wanted to gasp for air. One gulp would be a glug and both Prina and Princess Aileen would drown. Her mouth wouldn’t obey and stay shut. My first good deed gets me killed — typical. Dolphinfast rammed Prina so hard she bent double and opened her mouth. Coughing salt water Prina was tossed up onto the mud at the side of the harbour. ‘You will life?’ Dolphinfast asked lying beside her. ‘That’s ‘live’,’ Prina said coughing. ‘Yes, I’ll live.’ Looking past the mermaid, Prina saw Ivor fighting the water. All his strength couldn’t stop him from sinking. ‘Save him,’ Prina ordered the mermaid. ‘Bad man, better dead.’ ‘No, go and save him!’ ‘Why?’ ‘Because… ’ because as an ordinary person she had seen how widows and orphans suffered, because she knew exactly what it was like to drown, because… ’ because he did everything I planned to do to you.’ ‘You learned to do the right thing.’ ‘And you’re not giving him the chance to learn. Let him drown and you’ll be no better than me.’ Dolphinfast slipped into the water to become a silver flash in the dark. Prina waited until she saw Ivor surface with the mermaid pulling him to the mudflats. He was coughing and cursing in equal measure. Deciding it wise to vanish before the fisherman reached safety the dripping princess made her way home. She never found the book. No one did. Princess Aileen guessed it had been washed into the harbour and she didn’t feel like starting another. Meanwhile Prina already had the makings of an excellent plumber. ",candidate00007
21,00006,unknown,"The fall wind darted along the well-worn road, funnelled by the trees from which it whipped a cloak of leaves into a manic dance, ending abruptly against the unyielding rider. Stopping to flick a couple from his face, Galvain glanced at the mark on the tree as he passed. Ashoun had probably left the road at that point. Dismounting to examine his horse's shoe, he glanced at the procession following a short way behind, carriages, wagons and horsemen making their way up the gradual incline. Catching the eye of one of the horseman, he gave a slight nod, and the man urged his horse forward. Waiting, Galvain made a surreptitious sweep of the road ahead. His jet black, severely trimmed hair showed a few strands of grey as he removed a stray leaf. The charcoal grey of his uniform identified him as a mercenary, and the insignia on his chain shirt, a white hawk's head on a black background, identified his company. The forest road continued its slow climb for another hundred and fifty paces or so, before dipping again as a rocky outcropping raised the forest to the left a good ten feet, before that also dropped away. The road curved towards the right after that, but he couldn't see far along it from his current position. He turned back as Beroven rode up. “Sir?” Beroven made an equally casual inspection of the trail. Bald and meticulously clean-shaven, dressed the same as Galvain, he had to stop himself sitting to attention. “You saw the mark?” said Galvain. “Yessir,” Beroven replied in a muted tone. “They’ll probably be set up on the outcrop. A few archers up there, maybe some up in the trees to either side, and men on foot to run out in front and behind."" The occasional clump of bushes or other vegetation along the tree line offered cover from the road, and the overcast skies cast a blanket of shadows over the forest floor. They stood a short distance from where the nearest of the bandits would be set up, but the lack of visible movement offered little hope, as neither doubted Ashoun's warning. ""We could just walk on,"" said Beroven. ""Doubt they'd be desperate and stupid enough to attack a caravan guarded by a few dozen heavily-armed men."" Galvain stared at him. ""Or if we take our time forming up,"" said Beroven, little hope in his voice, ""they might run away before we get to them."" He ended with a sigh. Galvain wouldn't leave them to prey on other travellers. “Stop the carriages to look at that problem wheel,"" said Galvain. ""I want you, Grellden and a few of the others staying back, keep an eye out behind, though I doubt Ash’d have missed anything. Have the rest of the men come on up. When we engage, send Grellden off to the right to make sure there's none hiding on that side.” With a quick nod, Beroven trotted his horse back towards the procession, shouting at the lead coachman about straining the wheel. Turning back to inspect the trees, Galvain surreptitiously checked his sword, and loosened the ties holding his shield to the saddle. There'd been rumours of recent bandit activity in Arkandell. The reports usually blamed refugees from Gharual, although he'd found more believable the less common rumours of it being farmers and villagers from the border with Kauvaldt, since tensions between the neighbouring countries had seen a build up of forces in the area. But people preferred the idea of it being outsiders. The only vaguely reliable reports he'd heard came from the East of the country. Certainly not here, within a day's ride of the capital. Still, the reason for their presence didn't really matter. Satisfied with the straps, he remounted as the others drew near, and led them forward at a calm pace, looking for a spot to leave the road. He located a narrow spot a short way up. There may be wider openings further along, but the ground looked even enough, and it'd be better to get under cover early, acclimatize their eyes to the shade, and build up speed before reaching the main ambush point. His eyes darted to every movement, cursing the wind. Unless particularly dim, the bandits knew they'd been spotted, and would likely be considering their odds. If they hadn't already started pulling back then they could well break as soon as they faced charging horsemen. They'd likely set up in the best positions they could find, but few bandit groups could survive in one location for very long, so they probably wouldn't be familiar with the ground. But the tense silence from behind, broken only by the sounds from the coaches and the faint scuffing of weapons being readied, met an eerie stillness ahead, so if they had started moving, they'd done so quietly. Nearing the gap, Galvain steered his horse off the road, his fingers itching to reach for his weapon. A strangled yelp burst from up ahead, followed by the soft thud of a body plunging from a tree. Ash had already started, then. His sword out before the body landed, Galvain’s shield rose a moment later as he let out the call to charge, plunging into the trees, and hastily adjusting his eyes to the shadow. He saw another body drop a short way up, and spotted movement off to the left. The foot troops who'd have rushed out to block any retreat. Waving some of his men to deal with them, and hearing Keldun roar as he led that charge, Galvain spurred his mount towards the main clump visible ahead. His shield high, at least one missile glancing off it, Galvain didn't slow. He caught sight of movement up in the trees, as the archers perched there took random, panicked, shots, most missing their marks, hitting either ground or the intervening trees. The bandits on the ground also shot a few wild arrows at them. Most looked ready to bolt, but a couple shouted orders to keep the others in line. He barely registered one of the shots coming at him in time to drop his shield, and even then it pierced the edge of the shield, sticking in at an angle. His blood, already pumping fast, surged, and he pushed his horse faster still, gingerly raising his shield a touch to again spy on the bandits. They began discarding their bows in favour of melee weapons, so he raised his shield again, just in time to deflect another shaft from on high. A moment later he heard a cry from a horse behind, followed by the grunt of one of his men tumbling from it. With no time to turn and see the damage, he braced his sword to meet the enemy line. The two in charge barked orders for the line to hold steady, but a few had already broken and started running. If they could take those two down, the line, maybe around ten strong at the moment, wouldn't last, and they could deal with the more serious threat up in the trees. Galvain focussed on the nearest leader, who had his own sword prepared, but the bandit to his left had a rough pike readied, aimed at him. Barely slowing, Galvain slapped the flimsy weapon aside with his shield, kicking the man squarely in the face with his steel-toed boots as he passed to the left. Turning to find the leader as he wheeled his horse around, he spotted the man slicing a rider's leg as he danced around a tree trunk, using it as cover. Charging back at him, Galvain brought his shield down on the head of another bandit in passing, as the leader spied his approach and readied himself near the tree. Slowing, Galvain directed his horse to the right of the tree, and, as he'd expected, the bandit dodged around it as he closed in, before he could commit to a lunge. The man ducked out from the other side, trying to use the obstruction of the shield to cover his move, but Galvain had expected it, raising the shield and thrusting out with his own sword. It threw the man off-balance, and he jerked back from his aborted lunge. Using the momentary respite, Galvain quickly dismounted, regaining his balance before the man could attack again. Not having expected action, the horses hadn't been armoured, and they may've already lost one, so he didn't want to risk his against a competent opponent. And the man seemed to know how to fight. His insistence on keeping the rabble he'd been working with in line showed experience too, since that'd been a better option than running from horsemen, even if they'd had little chance. But his face now showed frustration at his situation. He seemed good enough to judge other fighters, and appeared to recognise Galvain's superiority, so he'd started backing away, possibly hoping to wear down his armoured opponent. He should know that'd be hopeless, though, as time would be against him with so many opponents nearby and his own men dropping quickly. His eyes said he knew capture would likely end in hanging, and didn't seem inclined to let it reach that point. Galvain saw the decision reached as the man's eyes tightened, and he stopped retreating, charging instead, launching a flurry of strikes on Galvain's shield, then spinning to the side of the shield as he tried to slash around it. Expecting it, Galvain stepped back just enough to avoid the attack, then darted forward with a thrust for the man's chest. The bandit recovered his sword quick enough to knock the attack wide, his eyes flickering with the understanding of his mistake the instant before Galvain's shield slammed into his face, knocking him back a step, stunned. Galvain's sword found him a moment later, but it took a couple of seconds before he hit the ground. Quickly scanning the surroundings, Galvain found resistance had dissipated, his men running down the last of them. The trees seemed clear, a few archers littering the ground nearby. The foot troops who'd have blocked the road ahead had been rounded up, without much of a fight, and his men herded them back towards the road. He tried to calm his blood as he realized it was over. Wiping his blade, he strolled back to his horse, mounting and heading back towards the road, passing the only casualties on their side. An arrow had grazed Helfrin's arm, little more than a scrape, and had caught his horse badly enough that it had to be put down. Wolk had taken a cut to the leg from the bandit, but had it bound for the moment. Another of the horses had taken a bad enough gash that it wouldn't be able to support a rider soon, and it would need to be led at a slow pace for a while, but it should recover. Reaching the road, he found the convoy unaffected by the skirmish, but plenty of glances coming his way. He approached at a calm pace, letting his blood slow. His men relaxed at his appearance, clustered around the elaborate coach in the lead, the focus of their current job. Or their current assignment, at least. Behind it stood another, dirtier and more crowded coach, followed by a few merchant carts, all of whom had jumped at the chance to travel with an armed escort given the rumours, which appeared a wise choice. The extra numbers offered more security, even if it might have slowed them a touch, and the merchants had paid by way of sharing food, which assuaged some of his men's grumbles about doing an unpaid job. Their last job had been escorting a consignment of precious stones from Farrandis. Too expensive to be allowed to travel unescorted, even without rumours of instability, his reputation saw his company often entrusted with such jobs. Since the local wars in Farrandis were experiencing a lull, he'd accepted the job and brought a unit of his men, leaving the others handling smaller jobs back home. He hadn't heard about the growing tensions with Kauvaldt until they'd set off, too late to back out without damaging his reputation. So he'd hoped to deliver the cargo and get out of the country before anyone tried forcing them into service. Reining his horse in next to the main coach, Galvain met Thyla’s wide-eyed gaze, a combination of anxiety and embarrassed excitement, glancing down the road. Her pale blonde hair showed as little sign of travel as did her dark green dress. ""Are there really brigands?"" she asked in a tone which tried to hide its understandable quiver. ""There were,"" he tried to sound reassuring. ""They're no longer a threat."" ""Was anyone hurt?"" She glanced at his clothes, and he became aware that he probably had blood spattering them, growing self-conscious and wishing he'd thought of cleaning it off. ""Any of your men, I mean."" ""A couple had scratches, as did one of the horses."" He saw no need tell her about the horse they'd had to put down, not wanting to further distress her. He glanced back down the road, trying to think what else to say. He rarely engaged in polite conversation these days, and felt tenser now than he had charging the bandits. His pumping blood had quickly overridden his worries then, but here he just foresaw the inevitability of some social blunder escaping his lips. When Lord Brien had heard of his presence nearby, Galvain had received an invitation to visit his childhood friend, and been asked a favour. To escort his daughter back to the capital. With some of his troops requisitioned to support the army, and the rest assuring the security of his own lands, he'd been loath to allow his daughter to travel without an escort, even if he put little stock in the rumours of banditry. He'd offered to pay, of course, but Galvain owed him too much to accept, and since it didn't take them too far off their route home, most of his men shouldn't grumble too much about the lack of pay. Of course, with what they'd just faced, he'd probably have to give them something from his own funds. ""It should be clear to continue soon,"" he said as Grellden emerged from the trees. ""Safer if you stay away from the windows until we've gone down the road a bit, though."" With a nervous nod, she sat back after a final glance up the road, and he nudged his horse forward. He doubted they'd missed anyone, or that anyone they did miss would be stupid enough as to draw attention to themselves, but he'd rather not risk anyone shooting at her as they passed, so he ordered a couple of his men to ride alongside the carriage. He rode forward to meet Grellden, Beroven joining him, but there was little to report on that side of the road, with no signs of bandits still in hiding or having fled. Nodding, he ordered them to start the caravan moving, sending a couple to help the wounded, and then nudged his horse back into the woods. Now his battle fervour had passed, his mind started to register the differences between some of the bandits, which had been irrelevant in the heat of battle, and wanted to check them out. The couple who'd seemed in charge had been less ragged and underfed than the rest, and the sword he'd been attacked with seemed remarkably sturdy now he thought about it. He passed a few bodies, and a couple of live ones being herded back towards the caravan. The prisoners appeared much as he'd expect, their clothes heavily worn and cheap, their faces lean and scared, desperation plain in their eyes. Their weapons didn't look much better, and a couple had broken in the skirmish, if it could be called that. Approaching the body he wanted, he found Halbryn and Creault rummaging through dead men's pockets. With a broadly healthy appetite, Halbryn's chain shirt looked a bit stretched as he crouched, unearthing little more than a portion of uneaten meat of indeterminate species, which even he found unappetizing. A tinkling of coins drew their attention to where Creault perched next to Galvain's target, flicking back greasy hair as it slipped over his narrow, angular, face. Lean, with a tendency to sharp jerky movements, he shot Halbryn a toothy, albeit lopsided, grin as he shook the purse. Halbryn glowered, his expression changing little. “How the cruk d'you always find the good stuff?” “It's jus' copper, anyhow,” said Creault, tucking it away and resuming his search. “Typical. We get attacked by the cheapest bandits.” With a quick check of the rest of his target’s meagre remains, Halbryn glanced at the other bodies. “If they had money,” Galvain said as he rode up, “they probably wouldn’t be bandits.” Halbryn glowered at him, accompanied by a grunt as he heaved himself to his feet, running a hand over his head and back towards his receding hair. He adjusted his armour into a more comfortable position, little altering the dishevelled look he achieved within minutes of donning clean clothes. ""Helfrin and Wolk have wounds need tending,"" said Galvain. ""Go see to them, and the injured horse, then get mounted up and moving."" Halbryn muttered as he straightened himself. “What kind of a world is it where ya can't even loot bandit crelluks in peace? Just trynna get some profit from my work.” He glared at Galvain, who ignored it. ""Wouldn't say it's a complete loss,"" said Creault, holding up a ring he'd just gotten from the bandit leader. ""Jus' typical,"" huffed Halbryn. Galvain held his hand out to Creault, who relinquished the ring with a reluctant ""cap'n"". It appeared expensive, probably actual gold. He didn't recognize the black star symbol on it, though. He tossed it back to Creault, who caught it with a grin. Dismounting, Galvain turned his attention to the body. Halbryn continued to grumble until a voice from behind made him jump. “Your horses are over there,"" Ashoun said in a calm voice. “It’s impolite to sneak up on people, boy,” barked Halbryn. Galvain hadn't heard Ash ride up either, but managed to avoid jumping. The boy led Keldun's larger mount, a slight grin creasing his tanned face as he passed, neither Raven, his horse, or Keldun's seemed to make a sound as he guided them. He met Galvain's gaze, but didn't slow. Of slight build compared to the other mercenaries, he had an athletic leanness, and his short dark hair wafted easily around his youthful face. While Galvain wanted to reproach him for going off on his own, he'd rather do so away from the others, so held his tongue as Ash moved on. He slowed near a tree where a falling archer had been snagged on some branches. Standing in his saddle, Ash reached up to retrieve the remaining arrows from the man’s quiver, continuing on as he sorted through them, discarding all but three of the shafts, which he placed in the quiver hanging from his saddle. Continuing to grumble, Halbryn moved back towards their horses, Creault in tow, and casually kicked one of the unpilfered bodies in passing, only to jump back with a start as it roused. Their swords drawn and pointed at it, Halbryn nodded at Creault to check the man. Gingerly using his foot, Creault rolled him over, and they saw his only wounds appeared to be a nasty gash on his arm, and a graze to the head. The man stirred as Halbryn crouched to examine his wounds, and check for weapons, Creault keeping his sword threateningly close. “Come on,” Halbryn shook the man’s face until his eyes opened. “You’ll live. At least until yer handed over to the law. On yer feet.” He dragged the man up, eliciting a grunt of pain. “It’s only a flesh wound. Well, maybe a small chunk of bone, too, but it's not gonna kill you. Let’s get you tied with your surviving friends and we’ll see about stitching it.” He let Creault prod the man towards the caravan as he grabbed their horses' reins. Returning his attention to the bandit leader, Galvain could tell that the clothes, while as dirty as those of the others, were of stronger fabrics, and nowhere near as worn. The man himself looked well-fed, of a sturdy build, and he'd moved like soldier. His blade, while not ostentatious, seemed solid. A good strong sword which appeared to have seen use. His curiosity as satisfied as it would get, he remounted. He'd be unlikely to get answers here, and didn't have much interest in pursuing the incongruity anyway. Possibly a couple of deserters, who hadn't fancied getting caught up in an actual war, had convinced some desperate farmers to turn to banditry. A source of quick money to see them out of the country. He certainly wasn't curious enough to hang about in this country longer than he had to. Heading back to the road, he caught sight of Ash off to the left, his path intersecting with that of Keldun, as the large man trudged back from wherever he'd chased down his prey. A head taller than most anyone else in their troop, with a mane of dark red hair flopping to his wide shoulders, he had a powerful physique, particularly imposing when the battle rage came upon him. Which seemed more often, of late. His bloodied state didn't surprise Galvain, as Keldun often left his horse when the rage took him, even trained warhorses getting skittish when he went there. Ash had suggested getting him a plough horse, whose slower pace may allow him to control his temper before reaching the battle, but they'd decided the animal would end up slaughtered in impatience. When enraged, the rest of the company knew to stay clear of him. While he'd never attacked them directly, he didn't necessarily pay attention to where his weapon went after leaving its target. He rarely took prisoners in that state. He'd also become more withdrawn of late, barely speaking to anyone but Ash, and seeming more haunted. Galvain knew he felt himself losing control. He'd seen it happen to others, but at least Keldun seemed concerned by it, to be fighting it, so maybe there'd be hope. But Galvain couldn't see what help he could offer, and had to weigh his concern against that for the safety of the rest of the company should the rage finally take control. Reaching the road, Galvain glanced at the dozen bound bandits, trailing the last wagon, and one of them on the back of the wagon with a vivid wound to his side. The merchant didn't appear happy with his unwanted passenger, but kept it relatively quiet. Moving ahead of the caravan, he took up the forward position again, and it wasn't long before Ashoun rode up. “Any injuries?” said Ash. Galvain told him. “Helfrin and Wolk are taking it slow. I left Grellden to ride with them and the wounded horse. Couple of other are riding wagons to spare the horses” “You want me out ahead, again?” Giving him a tired glance, Galvain sighed. “May as well. I doubt there’ll be more bandits this close to the edge of the forest, though. They’d drive nearby competition out first. And if you spot anything, circle back to warn us.” “I left a warning,"" said Ash, a touch defensively. ""Which you obviously saw.” “Then you took an unnecessary risk.” A habit the boy seemed to have fallen into recently, and one which worried Galvain. Looking at that calm face though, he had to remind himself Ash was no longer a boy, and he probably didn't need to be so concerned with his welfare. But he wasn't that old, and his youthful looks made it hard to remember. “There was little risk. Their poor attempts at concealment displayed a lack of experience at their chosen profession.” “That’s hardly reducing the risk. Amateurs are more likely to panic. Besides, a couple were competent enough.” “Apart from their spotter, they were set up too far away for their archers to get a good shot through the trees, and there were no signs they had horses, so I could have easily outrun them. What would you have done differently had I doubled back?” Galvain glared for a moment. “I’d have sent Grellden with you, so we could've cut down the number of archers before we went charging in.” Ash opened his mouth, but thought better of it. “Next time I shall turn back.” After a moment, Galvain returned the nod, turning to review his men’s formation as Ash rode ahead. The forest soon behind them, the procession reached the outskirts of Hadarfyn as the sun prepared to begin its descent in earnest. The original settlement had been built on a hill, but the place had sprawled out since. The inner city, the oldest part, still rose above the rest, with the palace looking down on everything. One wall encircled the inner city, and a newer one, less than forty years old, surrounded the rest of the city, although buildings had sprouted beyond it in the intervening years. The streets of the outer city had yet to clog with the homeward flood, but Galvain still felt the weight of memories pushing in on him as they made their way along familiar streets, looking as they had over a decade and a half ago. Maybe a bit more worn, greyer and crumbling. But they remained familiar, increasing his tension, and his desire to leave. They handed the bandits over to the guards at the front gate, and the wagons and other carriage took their own paths as they made their way through the city. The relative quiet of the streets allowed the procession a clear path to the gate into the inner city. The home of the influential, mainly the nobility, he grew increasingly uncomfortable as it grew nearer, but he probably didn't need to go much further. The guards lounging at the gate, in the dull blue uniforms of the city guard, sent curious glances their way, the presence of armed mercenaries an obvious concern given the current tensions, but their number wasn't enough to be worrying. And probably less an irritant than the zealous priest the guard's had given up trying to move along. Not venturing near enough to accost the gate’s foot traffic, he shouted his tirade from a short distance away. The officer rose with a sigh, having no need to concern himself with the pedestrians freely passing through the gate, but obliged to at least question this lot. His tone showed little enthusiasm as he asked by rote, “who do you serve?” “Myself,” said Galvain, equally disinterested. The guard’s face darkened. “What's your business here?” “Just escorting the coach. Don’t worry, we won’t be going any further.” Without waiting for further questions, he nudged his horse back towards the coach, the officer scowling after him before returning to stand near his seat. Reining his horse in, Galvain met Thyla’s smile as she moved to his side of the coach. She'd calmed from the earlier excitement, regaining her usual placid and approachable manner. “Lady Brien, you’re safely delivered to the city,” he said in a formal tone. “Thank you, Captain, and please, it’s Thyla. You’re not accompanying us further?” “Given the increasing tensions with Kauvaldt, I don’t want to hang around longer than I have to and risk getting drafted.” “Where will you go next?” “First to a road house a short way back, to wait for the others to catch up. Then back to Farrandis. They should have another small conflict, or armed feud, under way by the time we get back, and it’s a good place for a mercenary to sit out the freeze.” “I appreciate you delaying your journey to escort me.” She offered another genuine smile, before raised voices drew their attention. “Blasphemer!” the wild-eyed priest screamed, his finger lancing in accusation. “You take Ahramut in vain at your peril!” Halbryn, the target of his rage, paid little heed, instead gesticulating wildly at the pedestrians from his position next to the priest. “Getcher shiny new religions, three fer a shekel. And really, can you put a price on the secure future of your soul.” The priest turned to the guards. “I demand you arrest this man.” “For what?” the officer asked with a grin, enjoying the show. “He’s… ” the man’s protestations strangled as he turned to glare at the heretic. “If yer ready to accept Ah'mallmud inta yer lives, then raise yer right leg and wave yer left arm in a circle.” Halbryn's demonstration lasted seconds, before he had to regain his balance. “It’s Ahramut!” said the priest. “And he sees and hears your blasphemies and will not forget! Ahramut’s curse is upon you, and you will… ” The priest’s tirade was cut short as he jumped back from Halbryn’s flailing attempts to manically brush off his clothes. “Get it off me. Where is it?” Stopping his flailing, Halbryn hurriedly looked up his sleeves for the offending curse, to no avail. He started to check down his trousers, grabbing the front of his belt as a shout interrupted him. “Mount up, we’re leaving.” Galvain shot him a glare, before turning awkwardly back to Thyla. “My apologies.” “Unnecessary.” She didn't bother suppressing her smile. “My thanks again.” He nodded as he moved his horse towards the edge of town, another glare Halbryn’s way in passing. The coach continued through the gates behind them, but Galvain focussed on getting out of the city, and the country, as soon as he could, and not simply to avoid being pressed into service.

22,00007,unknown,"“Lis-s-sy, Li-i-i-iss-y… ” Lissy rolled over in her sleep. The voice hovered in the dark, repeated over and over in a singsong tone, piercing Lissy’s subconsciousness. She shivered and pulled the blanket over her head. “Li-i-issy—I miss you… ” “Wake up!” It shouted in her mind. She was cold. She burrowed deeper under the covers. Mary Beth was looking at her, smiling—then she was gone. There were sounds—muffled laughter mixed with little voices, many voices, jumbled. The doll house appeared. A soft glow shone from the windows. The door opened, rosy fog began drifting towards her, soft tendrils reaching, reaching… She fought to sit up but the blankets were wrapped around her, holding her prisoner. Let go, let go! She was thrashing, finally managed to push the blanket away and sit up. Her eyes went immediately to the doll house in the corner. It was dark, just like always. Her face was wet and she was shaking. The same dream—no, nightmare—again. Lissy Roberts and Mary Beth Staley were cousins and best friends—practically inseparable since birth. Their mothers were twins and after a double wedding both had gotten pregnant, giving birth to their daughters on the very same day. The girls looked enough alike to be twins themselves and shared a special bond. They formed a pact when they were eight years old—vowed never to be parted. Right before the girls’ tenth birthday, Joe and Bethany Staley were roaming through an antique shop, one of their favorite pastimes, when they found the perfect gift. “Joe! Look at this little house. Wouldn’t Mary Beth love this?” Her husband came to her side and instantly agreed. “It’s great! Both the girls will love it. They do everything together anyway—it can be their job to fix it up the way they want. We’ll clean it, they can do the rest. Good job, Bet.” When the doll house was presented to Mary Beth, it instantly became her most cherished possession. “Look, Lissy—it’s got three floors. We can store stuff in the little attic, like more clothes and things. There’s a mom, a dad and four girls. We can pretend they’re our sisters.” The small wooden figures were intricately hand carved, every feature distinct, right down to their fingernails. It wasn’t long before the girls discovered the doll’s clothes were removable. “Wow. We can change their outfits. Mary Beth, look at their eyes. Now move away. Doesn’t it look like they’re watching us? And there’s little light bulbs inside. Let’s ask your dad to fix the cord so we can plug it in. Then we can turn the lights on for them. The cord looks sort of dangerous with all the stuff coming off it. Looks like they wrapped thread or something around it—it’s coming apart.” Before long the little house looked like new. It sat in Mary Beth’s bedroom in the middle of her large dresser. The girls spent long hours with it, even preferring the company of their ‘sisters’ to going places with their parents. One Saturday morning Mary Beth’s parents decided to take the girls to the zoo. Bet knocked softly on her daughter’s door, opened it and went inside. She found her sitting in front of the little house, just staring inside. She looked sleepy. “Honey are you all right?” Mary Beth nodded. “I’m okay. I had sort of a bad dream last night and then I couldn’t go back to sleep for a while. I guess I’m tired.” “We were thinking of having a family day at the zoo. We can pick up Lissy, and maybe Aunt Liz and Uncle Max would like to go. How does that sound?” “I don’t feel like it, mom. ‘sides, Lissy can’t go—she’s coming over today and we’re going to clean the little house. It’s sort of dirty, or dusty.” Her mother didn’t say anything for a moment. “Mary Beth, is something wrong? You girls spend an awfully lot of time up here. The doll house isn’t going to go away. You don’t have to spend every minute…” Mary Beth stood up and whirled around to face her mother. She clenched her fists. “Mom! I don’t want to go! And Lissy won’t go either. There’s nothing wrong with me. I just like to be with the doll house. Go away and leave me alone!” She turned back, sat down and resumed staring inside the little building. Mary Beth began to change after that. Dark circles formed beneath her eyes and she would turn sullen, snap at Lissy. One day when Lissy called, her aunt said that Mary Beth didn’t feel well. “Lissy, you can come over if you’d like. I’m not sure what’s wrong. You girls are so close—did she ever say anything to you about hearing voices at night? She hasn’t been sleeping well and she’s losing weight. If this continues, she’s going to the doctor’s. Has she told you anything at all?” “No Aunt Bet—well, she did say something about hearing her name sometimes in the night. I think it kinda scared her. I guess I sorta said she was imagining things, because she never said it again. D’ya think she’s really sick?” “I don’t know, Lissy. Do you want to talk to her? She was sleeping last time I looked, but I’ll see if she’s awake.” “Oh, that’s okay. But—would you tell her I called and hope she feels better?” “Sure, honey. You know you can come over anytime—seeing you always makes her happy.” She hung up. That was the night Mary Beth disappeared. An open bedroom window at first seemed to be the work of an intruder. Her picture appeared on milk cartons, posters were hung throughout the small town with her smiling face and a reward was offered for information as to her fate. As time passed and no trace of her was found, the talk turned her into a runaway. “The story I was told when I got the little house was that it belonged to a guy who lost his family. It started out to be a gift for his girls—a miniature of the house they lived in. He worked on the little building every night in his basement after his wife and daughters went to bed. He used wood he’d kept from a barn after it burned. Funny thing, that fire.” The antique dealer paused, remembering. He was looking into the faces of two grieving people, standing in front of him, reaching out for anything that would help them cope with the loss of their only child. He continued. “What I heard was—the barn was there when he bought the place but it looked new. Nobody ever knew why it caught fire. It had one big room—he used half for storage, the other half as a workshop. It was close to the edge of a small stand of trees at the back of the property. It was the house that was in bad shape—it had been built in the mid-1800s and was practically falling down. Fifty years can take a toll on a house."" He stopped, looked down, remembering. After a few moments of reflective silence, he again spoke. “Seems like his family disappeared. He told some weird story that nobody ever believed. People just thought his wife took the kids and left. Or maybe that’s what they wanted to believe. Anyway, he finished the little house—said it was a tribute to his family. He was sort of obsessed with it—would hold the carvings in his hands and sit for hours, mumbling to himself. Lived there quite a while alone. “Somebody from the town—they lived out in the country—went by one day and no one was around. He was gone, too. Maybe he found his family and went after them. Years went by before somebody finally cleaned out the home. I got it as part of a store I bought out that was going out of business—place where they sold used stuff. The old guy that owned the place told me the story about the little house. Seems like he did sell it to a couple he knew for their daughter, but they brought it back. Some sort of problem. That's all he said. Lots of people looked at it but until you folks came along, nobody even made me an offer. Nice piece. Good workmanship. I figure it was built around the early 1900s. “Sorry about your little girl. Maybe she just ran away and she’ll come back.” The Staleys turned to leave, then paused. “What was the weird story he told that no one believed?” The antique dealer shrugged. “Oh, I’m not sure. I really can’t remember. But…did you ever notice a light…” He stopped. “Well, good luck to you both. Maybe you know somebody that would like the little house. I really don’t want it back.” They left the shop. The doll house remained covered in Mary Beth’s room, no one touched it. Until the day Joe and Bethany decided to give it to their niece. The story the antique dealer told was dismissed as just another strange tale, maybe even of someone’s madness. The father needed a way to cope. People deal with losses in their own way. The little house was just a wooden building with wooden carvings—maybe it helped him deal with his loss. Lissy would enjoy having it. Maybe it would help her deal with hers. It took them a year. They finally gave Lissy the doll house. “Mary Beth always said this was as much yours as it was hers. I know she’d want you to have it. We put off giving it to you, hoping … When I think back now, it all seems strange. The day before it happened she said again that it belonged to both of you, almost like … ” Tears welled in her aunt’s eyes. With a sad little smile, she turned and walked away. The little house sat on a table in the corner of Lissy’s bedroom for months before she could bring herself to touch it. Whenever she looked at it, she would picture Mary Beth, remember all they had done together and her heart would ache. The rooms began to look dull, colors dimmed by undisturbed dust time had collected. Lissy knew she should care for it—Mary Beth never allowed it to look shabby. She had even given the small family names and talked to them, as if they could hear her. The guilt Lissy felt at not tending to the house would be forgotten, as sadness overwhelmed her. One day, ‘DUST ME’ appeared on the tabletop. She ran her hand over the roof of the house and resolved to clean it that evening. After school, she pulled pins out of concealed hinges and removed the entire front side of the small building. Next, out came the wooden carvings and all the furniture from each floor. Their clothes seemed rumpled, almost as if they’d been slept in. Very carefully, she unhooked the snaps, removed each garment and rinsed it in a pan of water. One word flashed into her mind: “cold”. The room wasn’t cold, but she shivered. She gathered up the wooden family and wrapped them in a towel. Then came the furniture, to be dusted and polished. All that remained was the miniature attic. A rack, with extra sets of clothes, a rocker and a small trunk came out. When she reached in to wipe the floor, she discovered something else tucked in a corner, practically out of sight. A cot. With a small wooden figure lying on it. Lissy didn’t remember seeing it before and lifted it out, examining it. This figure, as with all the others, was intricately carved, with the most expressive eyes, somehow familiar, that seemed to be staring up at her. Mary Beth’s face came into her mind. Maybe she had added this and forgot to mention it. Lissy removed the figure from the cot and cleaned it. By the time she finished, everything shone, including the table. The family was back in place and Lissy turned off the lights. That night, they spoke. At first she thought she was having the same dream again, but as she came out of sleep and looked around the room she heard it—whispering, faint—more a thought than a sound. This time, she knew she was awake. Lissy slipped back down under the covers, listening, her eyes wide. The room was quiet. She finally fell asleep. It happened again a week later. This time the voices were slightly louder. She strained to hear, wondering if it was only the wind. When she looked out her window, everything was still. The moon cast light into her bedroom, its pale whiteness partially illuminating pictures, her clown collection, the dresser with its brushes, jars and small red bottles—all looked normal. One corner remained shrouded in darkness. The light seemed to stop at the edge of the table that held the doll house. She hummed to herself, finally drifted into sleep. “Lhih-s-s-y. Miss-s-s you. Co-o-me.” A hint of sound, almost-words, not quite defined. Lissy held her breath. Was it the wind? She sat up in bed and coldness, like a blanket made of frost, wrapped around her. It left the feeling of an ice cube being rubbed all over her skin, raising goose bumps. Her eyes were drawn to the house in the corner. The windows seemed to shine with a soft, rosy glow. The glow didn’t penetrate outside. No light seemed to show except inside the small building. A mixture of fear and curiosity, Lissy swung her legs to the floor and sat, staring at the sight. “Lii-i-i-iss … Lissy-y-y-y.” Her name hovered, trailed into silence. She sank to the floor in front of the house and knelt, looking through the windows. Something seemed out of place. She stared inside, squinting, concentrating—her eyes seemed to play tricks—was there a movement? Then she realized what was wrong. The cot that held the new little wooden figure—it was empty. Where had she put it? Lissy reached for the light switch. A small shock went through her when she touched it and she yanked her hand away. She knelt a few moments longer, looking—then decided morning would be soon enough to investigate. Back in her bed, she pulled the blankets up to her chin. She glanced once more at the corner table. It was dark. “Mother, do you remember when Aunt Bet said Mary Beth heard her name in the night? I thought I heard mine last night. The doll house looked funny, like a light was on or something. And there was a new doll—a girl on a cot—she’s wasn’t there. I know I put her back when I cleaned. Did you take her out?” “Of course not. You know I never interfere with your doll house—never have. Are you sure you weren’t dreaming? Did you look again this morning?” “No. I came right downstairs. I’ll go see.” Lissy ran up the stairs and entered her room. The doll house looked exactly as it always had. When she looked inside, everything was normal—even the figure on the cot. She was back. It couldn’t have been a dream—she remembered getting up and kneeling in front of the building. Didn’t she? Seven more days. Seven more nights. On the seventh night, she woke again to the sound of her name being called. This time, it was different. “Li-i-i-isy—I need you. Together—forever.” The tone was musical, almost hypnotic. Lissy swam up from the depths of sleep to the pull of the voice. She rolled over and looked at the doll house. It was glowing. And this time, as in her dream, the glow reached out from the front of the house. It seemed to be moving toward her. She bolted upright and watched in terror. “Mom! Mother! Come in here. Quick! Hurry!” A light went on, the sound of footsteps pounded down the hall, her bedroom door opened and her mother came to her side. “Lissy! It’s all right! You’re having a bad dream.” She was holding her, stroking her hair. “No—Mom! Look!” Lissy clutched her mother and pointed at the corner. It was dark, the only light in the room coming from the hallway. “Mom, I saw it! I really did! Something was coming out of it. It scared me!” “No honey, you were dreaming.” Her mother turned on the lamp next to the bed. “Look at the doll house. It’s dark. And it’s a wooden house with a wooden family—there’s nothing that can come out of it. Do you want me to take it downstairs?” Lissy was in her mother’s arms, listening to the soothing voice. Maybe it was all a dream. During her first year of school she had bad dreams. They were so real to her. Her mother convinced her then that nothing about a dream could hurt her—it was just another part of her mind—a part that only worked while she slept. Now, sitting in the lamp lit room, her fears slipped away. She smiled up at her mother, feeling slightly foolish. “No, I…I guess you’re right. I can’t remember it all that clearly, so it probably wasn’t real. I’m okay. Thanks, Mom. You’re terrific.” “Go back to sleep, hon. See you in the morning.” Her mother kissed her forehead and started toward the door. “I love you, Mom.” “Me too, hon.” The door closed with a gentle click. Lissy turned off the lamp. The corner was dark. Liz Roberts phoned her sister, Bethany Staley. “Bet, I need to ask you something. When, uh, before Mary Beth…well, disappeared…look, I know this is difficult for you, but something is happening to Lissy. She says she hears voices at night, that there’s some kind of light in the doll house…she’s not eating, looks terrible. If I remember right, didn’t something similar happen with Mary Beth? Didn’t you tell me…” “Yes Liz. The same thing you’re describing. I kept telling her she was dreaming. Even took her to the doctor’s. There was nothing wrong that he could find. He did say that if it kept up, it wouldn’t hurt to take her to a psychologist, just for an opinion, if nothing else. She…was gone before I had a chance. “There was one thing…I don’t think I mentioned it to you because at the time, I didn’t think it meant anything. Joe and I went to the antique shop where we found the doll house. The antique dealer related the story he was told when he got the little house. I guess it belonged to a guy that built it for his girls but they all left. The wife supposedly left with their daughters. Then he was gone too. None of them were ever seen again. “The other thing he said, and he didn’t explain it—the husband told some sort of weird story about what happened. Nobody believed it. I guess he was a little odd. We asked the antique dealer what the story was and he said he couldn’t remember. You don’t think—are you saying this has something to do with the doll house?” “I don’t know, Bet. I just know something is very wrong. I’d like to talk to the dealer. It probably won’t solve anything in my mind, but…can’t hurt either. I’m really worried about Lissy."" “Now, I’m only repeating what I was told. After your sister and her husband left, I started thinking about it. Well, I actually did remember but it’s too ridiculous to ever believe.” The antique dealer frowned as he looked at her. “Are you sure…” “Yes! Don’t you understand? Something is happening to my daughter. I don’t care how ridiculous you think it is I need to hear it! Please!” The antique dealer stared at her for a moment. “Okay, but please don’t take it out of context. Some things are just not possible. “His name was Fritz Brauer. He had a wife and two daughters. They lived on the outskirts of a small town and mostly kept to themselves. The house they lived in had been empty for a number of years and it was falling apart, from what I was told. Fritz was from Germany—spoke broken English and many of the townspeople believed that if it wasn’t for the fact that he needed building stuff, they would never have even met him. His wife, Elsa, taught their girls what they thought was important and of course they grew most of their own food.” Liz shook her head impatiently. “I don’t care about that! Please get to the part about why the family left—or whatever it is that you heard.” She was staring up at him intently. “Okay, okay. There was a barn at the back of their property that burned down. Before it burned, he would go in there and not return to the house for hours. Said he could talk to the people that lived there before them. Before they bought the place, I mean. He carved a lot—little figures, like people. Somebody said they saw sort of a rosy glow back there once. Like a light. Anyway, they had two daughters… "" ""Wait!"" Liz interrupted. ""I think there were four little girl figures in the doll house. Where did the other two come from?"" ""I don't know,"" said the antique dealer. ""Maybe whoever had it before added them—who knows? Like I was saying, he wanted more girls. Funny, I thought most people living back then wanted sons, so they could help plant, or whatever they did. Not Fritz—he wanted daughters. So like I said, one day the barn caught fire and burned most of the stuff inside. He pulled down what was still standing and saved a lot of the wood. That’s what he built the doll house from—wood from the barn. “It was supposed to be a surprise for his girls. But then they all left. He went into town and told the local law that someone took them. They all went out and looked around, but couldn’t find anything. Then he said no, not someone real, but a spirit—came from the barn. Said he used to talk to the spirit back there. I’m not sure if he called it a spirit, but it was something like that. “After he finished the little house he began carving the figures. One he said was his wife, the others, his daughters. The figures sort of looked like them, from what I hear. Then he got really weird. He would sit in the empty house, holding the little carvings in his closed hands and talk to them. For hours he would do this. Almost like he thought they were real, or he could make them real. “The last time anyone saw him was in the town. He went in to tell the law that everything was all right. He knew where his family was and he was going to them. They said he looked almost happy. “A few weeks later somebody went out to the house and it was empty. Said you walked in and it looked like they were all still there. Clothes, dishes, everything—the house was just like it always was. And the little house. Four little carvings inside, all wearing clothes. They were really—exquisite. Lifelike. Well, you know that. “I don’t know if all this told you anything, Mrs. Roberts. I know what it makes one think, but we both know nothing like that could ever happen. “Hope you find out what’s wrong with your daughter. Sorry I couldn’t be more help, but I told you it was just a story. Nobody really knows what happened back then."" Dreaming, always dreaming…listening to voices calling, swirls of rosy fog gliding, reaching out. Did she really sleep? Mary Beth was calling…“come, be with me, together, always … ” Lissy’s appetite faded, she picked at her food. Concern showed in her parents’ eyes. Her mother questioned. Was she sleeping? Lissy assured. She was all right. They wanted to move her doll house. No, please don’t, Lissy pleaded. So it stayed. Nothing was wrong. After all, when she woke at night—was fully aware—the corner was always dark. Dark that is, until now. The welcome mat glowed. Its’ message flashed through pink mist. Lissy watched it blink—on, then off, on, then off—over and over. She was relaxed, her body tingled, seemed to rise—weightless, she floated into the mist. Mary Beth’s face, smiling, drawing her forward—“together, always.” Pleasant warmth enveloped, hands seemed to stroke. The door swung wider and she drifted—closer, closer … The antique dealer pulled the newspaper out of its wrapping and picked up his morning cup of coffee. He scanned the first section, then went on to the second—local news. The article appeared on the first page. “STRANGE HAPPENINGS SURROUND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF…” There it was—a photograph of the little house he had sold the Staleys. Seems like another girl was missing, Staley’s niece, after inheriting her cousin’s doll house. The thought crossed the antique dealer’s mind that maybe he should have related the entire story to the Staleys when they came to his store. Might have prevented the second girl… But that was ridiculous—none of it was true. It was too strange to be true. The only place things like that happened was in fiction stories. Wasn’t it?

23,00008,unknown,"The young actress Muriel Casterton celebrated her stage debut with cast and crew back stage after opening night. The audience’s thunderous applause was still ringing in her ears when the well meaning party host introduced Muriel to another first for the day: Udolpho Wolfe. This became an instant, all consuming, intoxicating and lifelong infatuation. She failed to show up for rehearsals soon after. Her critically acclaimed performances waned under Udolpho’s influence. Family and friends knew about him and her fiancé was aware of her obsession. Idle gossipers blamed Udolpho for a sudden and premature end to the career of a “rising star”. The infatuated grazier, David Mackay from Seymour, wanted no other. He married Muriel knowing full well that she would not give up Udolpho. The hope, that in time she would tire of him, was soon dashed. She never did entirely, busybodies say. The Dutchman was always at hand. I gleaned these snippets over the years. Let me tell you what I know. My Aunt Muriel, it seemed forever and certainly before I left High School, called at our place on Wednesdays. Not on a Tuesday or a Thursday, not on weekends, but on Wednesdays. Wednesday was significant but it wasn’t until many years later that I found out why. She must have been around 35 when the regular visits started. I know this because my mum was her older sister by four years. I once addressed her as Auntie Muriel and was quickly put in my place. Aunt, not Auntie. Aunt Muriel rang our door bell at 5.50 PM, never earlier, sometimes later when the train was late. The Wednesday afternoon service from Seymour was due at Essendon Station at 5.30 PM. From there, it was only a comfortable five minute walk to our house. She spent 20 minutes somewhere. I usually answered the door, let her in and she hugged me to her ample bosom. As a young boy I didn’t mind. In my teenage years, feeling the closeness of her breasts first embarrassed me, then excited me, then embarrassed me and once a man, put me off. Off-putting too, was the smell of peppermint she had about her. That and Eau de Cologne, which I knew from a sneak look in her handbag. The peppermint haze was just bearable in winter. Not so in summer, when peppermint seemed to ooze from her skin. It mingled with cologne and sweat and drove me away. She made herself comfortable in the front room, in the armchair near the window, where visitors sit. She brought her own teabags, Twinings Earl Grey and I brought her hot water. She ate French Brie with water crackers and peeled an apple with a small ivory handle knife. She lit up a black Sobranie cigarette for afters and made me listen for the umpteenth time to stories of her life in the Thea-ata. She spoke of allnight parties, autograph hunters, stage-door Johnnies and marriage proposals. She knew people I had read about and seen in black and white movies. Did I know that she turned down an invitation to star on Broadway? She had given all that up for a life in the country. Yeah, right. By the time the family finished their own tea, it was time for me to escort Aunt Muriel to the station to catch the 7.20 PM rattler to Flinders Street. Dad meanwhile had finished his second bottle of VB. “Get me another long-neck, son,” he’d say. I was twelve maybe when Dad sometimes became so legless that I had to fetch his beer from the garage fridge. I also took away the empties and tasted the dregs before stacking the bottles along the side fence. Sometimes I’d pour him a glass and when he wasn’t looking, this naughty boy took a swig. There was a lot of drinking in my house, especially at weekends. I once tried spirits but didn't like the taste. But a dash of rum with Coca Cola, when I was seventeen, tasted terrific. I enjoyed the second one less. I remember well the Wednesday, before my graduation. I was in a milk bar when I saw Aunt Muriel on the footpath opposite enter the Ladies Lounge of the Railway Hotel. For once, the train was early. Ten minutes later, she emerged and made for our house. I pretended to be looking for her in the pub. I had just missed her, the barman said. I asked what I should buy her as a surprise birthday present. He pointed out a long square bottle on the top shelf and described what it was and where it came from. Muriel’s favourite drink came with peppermint. That evening, we took the train together to Flinders Street saying I was meeting my girlfriend at the station. I watched her turn the corner into Flinders Lane and followed her. She stopped near the Elizabeth Street corner and entered a basement door. No sign, but men in business suits, men in shabby clothes, old men, young men, well dressed ladies and some not, entered without hesitation. I knew one face, our Postmaster, who averted his gaze. Not so one of my lecturers, who told me to come in or piss off. I withdrew politely, waited and entered the building. Access to a meeting room was by a single glass panel door. Ten rows of chairs and some 40 people. When no one else arrived, I entered the room and sat in the last row and listened as speaker after speaker addressed the group. Some said only a few words, others spoke for a minute or more. The group as one greeted each speaker. I left when Muriel stood up and walked to the lectern, for I didn't want her to see me. I heard a resounding “Hello Muriel” as I shut the door quietly. What a dreadful place. These poor people who had only themselves to blame. My job had taken me to Sydney for 10 years with an occasional return to see my parents who had moved from Essendon to Beaumauris. Aunt Muriel found a new Wednesday afternoon stopover at my cousin’s. Muriel came to Marcia’s wedding and drew a crowd of admiring single and married men, who should have known better. She was darling this and darling that, lightly touching men on the arm, hugging those she knew well, twirling a scarf, arranging her locks, laughing and flirting with anything in long pants. She ignored the filthy looks from women married and single and chose not to hear “silly old tart” and “mutton dressed as lamb” snide remarks She embraced me too - the peppermint scent was still there. Somehow, it smelled fresher and cleaner. She was happy to learn that I was back in Melbourne for good. I wasn’t, for the transfer was an offer I couldn’t refuse. I found a flat in St. Kilda on Saturday, moved in on Sunday, started work on Monday and fronted up at 7.55 PM at an address in Flinders Lane on Wednesday, a condition of my ongoing employment. The closer I came to my destination, the more familiar it looked. I recognized the basement door, entered the meeting room and sat in the chair nearest the door. I objected to what the banner on the wall told me. The poster prayer meant nothing to me. The chairman called on volunteers to start proceedings and beckoned the first to raise his hand to share his experience. “My name is Julian and I’m an alcoholic.” In unison, the audience replied, “Hello Julian.” I didn’t hear what else Julian had to say. I am not like him. Or am I ?Apparently, I am an alcoholic in the eyes of my employer. Pig’s arse. Others came to the lectern and the ritual continued. I had nothing in common with any of them. Muriel rose for her spiel. She gripped the lectern and looked in my direction. A dramatic pause, then:” My name is Muriel.” Pause. “And I am - an alcoholic.” “Hello Muriel !” “I haven’t had a drink for eleven years, three months, two weeks and a day,” she confessed. What??? Liar ! Liar! You drunken hypocrite cow! I know you drink Udolpho Wolfe’s Aromatic Schnapps. Holland Gin. The barman at the Essendon Railway Hotel had revealed this to me. Schnapps and pepps. That’s your poison. Gin flavoured with peppermint to mask the stink of your addiction. She revealed, I suppose more for my benefit than anyone else’s, her first taste of alcohol, schnapps and pepps at the debut party. She spoke of its seductive sweetness, that it felt warm, good, made her giddy and wanting more. She drank and drank to oblivion that night, the first black-out, one of many. She had lost count. I froze. Last night? You blacked out! I could not account for the bruises on my forearm or anything after the taxi dropped me off at the flat. I had one too many. But only one. How do you know? I really felt sorry for her when she disclosed an instant addiction, a familial predisposition to alcoholism that ended a promising career and denied her a name in lights. Casual drinking turned unstoppable habit. Udolpho soothed the despair of not being able to stop and helped her forget what she had become. But on sobering up, the feelings of self-loathing and hopelessness overwhelmed her once again- the vicious circle started over. Schnapps and pepps was the crutch that helped her cope with the role of countrywoman away from the footlights. Salvation came, when in desperation, her husband threatened divorce. She came to Alcoholics Anonymous in Melbourne once a week. For a while, bottled courage made it easier to confess her shame to strangers. “Ha! Ha! Dutch courage from the Railway Hotel to counter Wednesday’s fear.” Now she drank only sparkling mineral water with a drop of peppermint essence. This was her treat, a nostalgic but safe compensation for the reality that she must never again touch anything stronger. Adieu Udolpho. As others related their plight and deliverance, I saw parallels with my existence. I might be there next Wednesday and maybe admit to a slight drinking problem, perhaps. Muriel ended her talk by declaring that AA had saved her health, her sanity and her marriage. Two hours on a Wednesday were sufficient motivation and inspiration to help her through the next seven nights. Nah, I’m not that far gone. I made it three nights before reaching for my poison. A Bundy and coke or five. But I stopped before the second blackout. Did I? See you Wednesday, Aunt Muriel. ",candidate00004
