0,00001,candidate00001,"Victor Dolor went to the diner because two months ago a man killed five people there. The man was Hugo Herrera. He was forty-one, divorced, recently unemployed from a downsized-factory job, and had finally been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder from something that happened when he was a child. Victor scanned several online articles for more specifics about the childhood trauma but found nothing. In response to Hugos most recent therapy session with some high- priced psychologist, Hugo wrote a letter to The New York Times that said he was ""sick of all the fucking shit and finally going to do something about all the worthless shits in the world."" The Times did not print the letter. Two days after he mailed it, Hugo took his hunting rifle into the Alexis Diner just outside of Stone Creek, New York, and murdered five people. It was a sign. There had been many signs recently but the Hugo Herrera murders was the most significant. Everything was changing. The period of acqui- escent apathy was over. The time of now was the dawning of the age of the great cleansing when humanity would rid itself of the living detritus, shed the human excrement clogging the world, and give birth to a new golden age of empowered living. Victor had been chosen. He was a cleanser. Hugo had been a cleanser. Unlike Hugo, however, Victor was not about to kill in one grotesque orgy and then blow his own face off. Victor would help cleanse human- ity but he would do it so he too could one day enjoy the fruits of his labor. The next world would be his. He had also gone to the diner for the girl. She was in a booth with her father off to the left. Victor did not let his glance linger over her smooth flesh or soft red hair. She did not look up. Victor sat at the counter on a plush red stool. A young Mexican boy slid a place setting in front of him and produced a glass of ice water. Victor stared at it. In the journey to preserve the status quo, to stave off the inevitable shifting landscape of the cosmos and humanity, the powers that be kept the water supply bloated with mind-numbing drugs. People who drank from this endless reservoir of placation would be blind to the ensuing changes. They would be ignorant of all the signs the universe offered. The warnings. Condensation trickled down the side of the glass like tears. Or clear- colored blood. The swinging door to the kitchen opened and a middle-age woman in a black and turquoise uniform smiled at him. Deep wrinkles creased her face like the cracks in dried mud. ""Morning,"" she said to Victor. ""Coffee?"" He smiled right back, nodded. When she set down the glass he asked her about Hugo Herrera. He ex- pected her face to pale rapidly, her meaty hands to grab at the counter and her throat to make some kind of choking, gasping noise that was really a cry for help. Instead, she shrugged and said she hadnt been working that day, but it was a horrible, horrible tragedy. Victor slowly turned his coffee cup in a circle. It made the faintest scraping noise against the counter, almost like the sounds the mice in his basement made at night. ""Any idea why he did it?"" Victor sounded so calm, so damn normal, so average-Joe. The waitress paused. ""Everyone has a breaking point, I guess. Sounds to me like he just snapped. Or he was crazy."" ""No doubt,"" Victor said. The aroma of fried sausage swarmed around him like poison gas. ""But why here? Was he a regular?"" ""I never heard of him until that day when Arlon, my boss, called and said some wackjob shot up the place. Killed five people, one of them was a waitress."" ""You know her?"" ""Sabrina? She was a new girl. Just out of high school, looking to save up for community college. She was a pretty thing. Such a shame."" Victor glanced around, merely for show. The diner was fairly busy this Saturday morning. People were engaged in conversations in the booths while scraping their forks across plates that must have been used a bil- lion times. The only other patron at the counter, however, was an old man in a big, heavy coat. He was at the far end, a cup of coffee before him and a newspaper. ""Place seems to have bounced right back,"" Victor said. ""Like it did after the last time."" The waitress nodded. ""I didnt know what to expect. Thought Id be out of a job. But Arlon reopened after three days, when the cops were done, of course, and people came back. Helps to be the only diner in a twenty-mile radius."" ""Im sure."" Victor had lived in Stone Creek his whole life. The little town was squished on the corner of Orange County, New York, at the foot of Blood Mountain. The mountain was the second highest peak in the region next to Schunemunk Mountain, which, at almost seventeen- hundred-feet high, always got all the attention. Blood Mountain, however, had that killer name and the beauty that went with it. ""What did you mean, the last time?"" the waitress asked. ""Some places are marked,"" he said. ""Marked?"" ""Cursed, I guess youd say, but its more than that."" ""Uh-huh,"" she said. ""What can I get you?"" ""The coffee is fine for now, thanks."" ""You just let me know."" She winked. Victor smiled back. What would she look like beneath his hunting knife? Would she still wink at him when he pushed it slowly into that soft spot at the base of her throat where her skin had started to sag? She walked down to the old guy at the end of the counter and then made her way to the front of the diner where the rest of her customers waited in booths. Victor spun slowly on the stool as if he were maneuv- ering to get up, maybe head to the bathroom. The girl and her father had only coffee and water so far. But they would soon be eating quite a large breakfast. They wanted to have enough energy to make it to a late lunch if not dinner. They would have eggs and bacon and pancakes and toast and hash browns. They would eat up because they thought it would help them. He would watch them eat for a little while. Watch the way the girl, not a girl but a young woman, chewed her food. The way her jaw moved. The way her lips pursed open just slightly like offering some secret kiss. He would watch and then he would go back to his car and eat the tuna fish sandwich waiting there. He would leave five dollars on the counter and a full cup of coffee Mercy Higgins did not want to climb some ugly mountain with her fath- er when she could be at home reading a book or working on one of her short stories. Could be at the bookstore helping Pete clean out the fiction section for the new coffee bar he was installing. Dad needed this, however, and that would have to suffice. The book someone had given him at work Daddy/Daughter Bond- ing: Activities to strengthen a Fathers Connection with his Daughter waited before him like it was his meal. Several skinny Post- Its stuck out from the pages. ""I know you dont want to do this,"" Dad said. She started to protest but he continued. ""I know this may not be what you want to do on a Saturday, but I think itll be good for us. Get some fresh air. Some dis- tance from the world. You might actually have fun."" They had never been camping. Dad never showed any interest and she certainly had no desire to sleep in a tent on the ground. Not to mention the hiking. They werent prissy people; they just liked their quiet time at home. It was warm there, especially in the reading room where Dad kept the fireplace going through the winter and the walls of books sheltered her like giant arms. Mom had loved that room, too. ""Its fine, Dad,"" she said. ""Im looking forward to it."" She held his gaze long enough for him to believe it, or at least add it to the tomb of self- denial he was perpetually building. ""Its supposed to be beautiful tonight. Maybe a little chilly but weve got the thermal sleeping bags and the arctic tent. The portable grill, too. Hopefully, Ill be able to get a fire going."" He laughed in that way that al- ways made him sound vulnerable. It was something she liked about her dad, something shed liked about Joel at school, too. So many men came across as cocky know-it-alls; it was refreshing to find a few who could be self-deprecating. ""I know, Dad."" ""I bought the best stuff. Its not like were heading out unprepared."" ""I know."" ""Its going to be fun. Trust me."" About a month before she died, Mom told Mercy all the things she loved about her husband. She said them slowly, breathing shallowly between words. When Mom started on the physical traits, Mercy had steeled herself against the expectation of graphic sexual references be- cause sometimes in those last days Mom had forgotten what she was saying, gotten really vulgar. Instead, Mom said it was Dads smile that always moved her heart. So sweet and inviting. And those dimples. Dads smile now was no less sweet but carried a weight of despera- tion. The beard hed grown had covered his dimples and his face had thinned. ""Youre really sweet, Dad."" ""No pity on your old man. This is for us."" When the waitress took their order, they both asked for more food than they had intended, like they knew they would need it. Beyond the parking lot outside the window was Route 51, which led straight across the county to New Jersey in the west and onward to New York City in the east, and on the other side of the road, almost close enough to touch, waited the foot of Blood Mountain. Clouds obscured the peak like it was something secretive. Or dangerous. Victor did use the bathroom before he left the diner. It was a cramped, two-person room with one stall and a urinal. When he relieved himself, Victor admired his penis. He stretched it out. From what he found on the Internet, it was above-average in length. When he had paid a woman to suck him off, she made no comment about his size. He almost asked but he didnt want her to look at him with that skeletal face and gap-tooth smirk. ""Soon enough,"" he murmured to it. He put himself carefully away in his pants before he could get excited and washed his hands at the sink. Too many images crowded his mind. So many ways he could manipulate the female body. So many positions. He had to keep those images in check. If he let his excitement get control, he would lose the upper hand. He had planned this for far too long to let it get away because he was desperate for a womans touch. After the cleansing, there would be plenty of women for men like him. Plenty of touching. Mercy Higgins could be saved. It would be her choice. Victor almost missed the writing on the mirror. He started to turn away, shaking his hands dry, and wondering if using their water had been such a good idea; it might permeate his skin, infect him. In the lower right corner, scratched into the mirrors surface, it said: Cleanse the World. Victor traced the three words with his finger. The indentations they made in the mirror were like slices in skin, knife tracks about to spout blood. It didnt matter who put it there, Hugo or someone before him. It was another sign. Victor left the bathroom. His smile must have looked so peculiar. While Mercy and her father gobbled eggs and pancakes and toast, the teens in the booth across from them discussed the recent shooting in which a crazy guy named Hugo killed five people in this very diner. ""Fucking guy came in with a shotgun or some shit and bam! bam! bam!"" The teenage boy in the skinny jeans and body-tight hoodie made a child-like gun gesture with his thumb and forefinger. His equally tight-dressed friend laughed like the kid was talking about some movie. The first kid glanced around, like scoping out the place. ""Can you ima- gine? Must of been sick to see it go down. Blood hitting the walls and shit."" ""Youre sick, man,"" his friend said. The first boy glanced at Mercy and her father. His gaze lingered briefly. What was he seeing in his head? Was he imagining fucking her in some degrading way? ""Cant be prude about it,"" he said to his friend. ""Most people live in a bubble."" Thats what Joel had said: Mercy, you live in a bubble. And hed told her to use fabric softener. Such a weird thing to say. Youre clothes al- ways smell stale. So, shed used dryer sheets and went around in a cloud of lemon. Then hed told her she had clammy hands and that hed found someone else. She tried to elicit a smile from him but he stared at her like she was some beggar on the street. In a way she had been. Shed begged to have sex with him, told him she was a virgin and that she really wanted him, even though she wasnt sure that was the case but she was almost out of college and nobody graduated college still a virgin. Only losers. Then he said her hands were clammy and hed met someone else. ""Can you imagine how fucked up it must have been?"" the first boy asked. ""Im glad I wasnt here,"" his friend said. ""Fuck that. I would have taken that guy down. Would have shot him between his eyes. Watch the blood splatter. Been a hero."" Mercys eyes started to water. A minute ago she had been fine. Her only feeling was one of slight dread about hiking up a mountain on a chilly spring day and then having to sleep on the ground at some camp- site. Then those two boys started talking about the killing and she was remembering Joel for some reason and how he said she smelled stale and had clammy hands and wouldnt have sex with her and then she had graduated a virgin. Now, she was crying. Sometimes she hated being a woman. Her father put down his fork and touched her arm. ""Honey, whats wrong?"" She took several napkins out of the dispenser on the table and dried her eyes. When she looked at her father, he had that sweet face he al- ways got when things didnt turn out right for her. When shed fallen off her bike as a little kid. When her violin audition for Juilliard fell through and she studied literature at the State University in Pleasantville instead. When Mom died. ""Im sorry,"" she said. ""You have nothing to be sorry about. This is my fault. I shouldnt have pushed this whole camping thing on you. I just thought it would be fun. Thought we could have some time to bond."" Tears began to reemerge. ""Its not that. I want to go camping. Its just ... Just ... "" She paused, breathed deeply. ""I have to use the bathroom."" When she slid out of the booth, the first boy said, ""You think the guy wanted to have sex with any of the bodies? Shoot his load and then shoot his head off."" If Mercy were a different sort of woman, she would tell them to stop being such stupid pricks and grow up and then shed throw a cup of cof- fee on each of them. She started to get her tears under control. A skinny guy with several- days worth of stubble on his face was staring at her. He was walking past the counter while she was on the opposite side of a dividing row of booths. He wore jeans and a black jacket. He was cute, too, aside from an undernourished face. She knew him from somewhere. Their eyes met and the man looked away. A moment later he was at the front door and Mercy was in the bathroom. She knew him. She had spoken with him. Victor held the girls gaze for no more than a second or two. He would have loved to stare at her for hours. Loved to hold her close and stare in- to her eyes, caress the fragility of her soul. There would be time for that later. If she caught on too soon, there was a risk the whole thing might collapse. He had pressed his luck, no doubt about that, and if he pressed it any further he would be, as his father used to say, S.O.L. No dinner tonight, son. Sorry. But Im hungry. S.O.L. Shit out of luck. Victors father hadnt been a bad man or even a bad father. He was the kind of father who never understood what fatherhood was really about. He saw Victor as a roommate, maybe even an acquaintance. He didnt belief in tender consolation. Life dealt you a bad hand? Well, looks like youre S.O.L. Victor didnt want to be S.O.L. Luck had been with him for a while now. It would continue to be with him. He only had to trust the greater powers manipulating his future. He turned from the girls soft white skin and innocent blue eyes. They would be his in time. Then he could chew on that flesh and suck those eyes right from her skull if he wanted. Maybe shed even like that, get off on it. Her body would convulse in a spasmodic orgasm as her eye slid past his lips and onto his tongue. He walked quickly outside to his car. The friction of his jeans only en- couraged his arousal. His underwear, always a size too small on pur- pose, was doing little to stymie the growing bulge. He had parked at the far end of the parking lot. His car was a beater from the late eighties he had bought for one-hundred dollars. It had two- hundred-eighty thousand miles. The steering wheel shook violently at speeds over forty and the exhaust stank of rotting eggs. But it was all he needed. There were no cars near his. He dropped into the drivers seat. It groaned like it might finally give out. He yanked down his jeans and took his cell phone from his jacket. He caressed himself faster and faster as he scrolled through the fifty pic- tures he had taken of Mercy Higgins. He managed to get the box of tissues out of the glove compartment in time. Mercy almost started crying harder when she thought how much easier it would be to explain everything to Mom. Women understood how messed up they were. They knew their bodies were uncontrollable ves- sels of perpetually battling hormones. A woman could be giddy with happiness one minute and completely devastated at the crippling power of some perceived fear the next. She could not explain everything to Dad. She couldnt tell him how she felt about Mom, about her despera- tion to have sex with Joel, her overwhelming feeling of failure about her music and her fear that her life was a pointless string of disappoint- ments. Mom would have understood, let her voice her shopping list of worries and then shared a secret smoke with her and told her that life for a woman was much harder than a man could ever realize. Dad would blame himself because he was sensitive and then shed feel even worse. She almost surrendered. She almost told Dad that she wasnt feeling well and that shed rather just go home and curl up in bed with a book. Spend tomorrow at the bookstore helping Pete. The bookstore. Where she had seen that guy. Since high school, Mercy worked a few days a week at a local book- store called Rune Books. Pete Harwinski started the place in the eighties and managed to keep it profitable through all the publishing scares. He created an online presence to make his place known for the people who prided themselves on shopping only at privately owned shops. Hed re- cently added free Wi-Fi and was building a coffee bar with a few plush chairs for costumers who didnt want to buy books but liked scrolling the Internet in such ambiance. Since graduating, Mercy worked there six days a week. Shed probably end up serving coffee by the end of next week. Not very impressive for someone with a Bachelors in Literary Theory with a minor in English Literature. The store was never very busy except around Christmas, but Pete made enough to keep the business going and pay Mercy twelve dollars an hour. She lived at home and didnt really care about the money. She worked there because Pete was such a nice guy, a second father, really, and because shed always loved books. She could sit in the store, breath- ing in the sweet intermingling aromas of new and old books and read all day long. The small size of the store and the way the towering shelves of books obscured what dim lighting there was always intimidated newcomers. Most newbies wanted the latest bestseller from whoever, but some were on a mission to get a rare hardback copy of some novel published in the sixties or seventies. Maybe two-dozen regulars frequented the store every few days or so on what seemed like a rotating schedule. Most were nice, some weird. She knew all their names, too, all except for the guy she had just seen in the diner. She should have recognized him immediately. He usually came into the store every three or four days an hour or so before closing. He never returned her hellos. He went right to the far end of the store, opposite the cashier counter. He never seemed to find anything to buy. Pete called him ""the perpetual browser."" Mercy was reorganizing a shelf of horror paperbacks from the eighties with their flashy covers of gory monsters and blood-soaked landscapes when he caught the man peering around the corner of the bookcase at her. She asked if she could help him. His eyes did some kind of weird jiggle or something and he said no. A moment later, he was running out of the store like he had forgotten some urgent appointment. That had been a month ago. Since then, he had been in the store but al- ways like a ghost, hidden from view, only felt as some kind of different presence. Not threatening, exactly, but certainly strange. He probably wanted to ask her out. Perish the thought. Victor cleaned himself up and stuffed the towel back into the glove com- partment. Free of that stuff, his body was calm, his mind focused. When he didnt relieve himself for a while, he could get a little crazy. He accep- ted that. The pleasure he gave himself was part of his maintenance, like brushing his teeth or bathing. With a clear mind, he could see the situation better. See the pitfalls. The danger. He had been stupid to enter the diner. Stupider still to stare at the girl and, stupidest of all, to make eye contact. It wouldnt take long for her to place who he was. Not that she knew anything about him, but he hadnt exactly been as covert as the situation required. The girl might get freaked, call off the camping expedition. Shed told her friend over the phone that her father thought the night on the moun- tain would be some kind of bonding thing but she would much rather see a therapist together. The girl had laughed at something her friend said before saying that maybe it wouldnt be so bad, maybe they would run into a cute hiker. Victor had been near the back of the bookstore where she worked, on his knees, pretending to scan the bindings of old hardcover books. The girls voice echoed through the store and teased him with its sensuality like those mythological creatures and their songs that lured sailers to their death. The girl was no beast. She was an innocent, perhaps marked for death as the old world gave way to the New Time, but he would give her a chance to save herself. At least for a while. It was the how of this situation he had never fully calculated. He couldnt simply speak to her. She would see the truth of his nature, dis- cover he was a cleanser, and rebuke him. Then he would have to kill her. For now, he would stay out of the way. Trail them up the mountain. Hide in the distance. Wait for his opportunity. Like when the rats came out. He could spend hours waiting in the dark of his basement. His hearing would get fuzzy and then adjust to the silence. His eyes would find the outline of the furniture and then gradually reveal their hidden dimensions. If he waited long enough, his senses grew super keen. Then the rats had no chance. Sometimes he killed them outright. Other times he amputated their legs and then gradually sliced open their bellies to see how long they would keep fighting to live. The struggle could last for some time. He would trust in his patience, in his senses, in his self-control. In the power the universe had given him. That was easy to do when his mind wasnt flooded with images of the girl on her knees before him, mouth wide. In those fantasies, her eyes were black holes that cried tears of blood. Like the tears the trees cried on the mountain. The girl and her father were at a table in one of the windows. The glare from the sun painted the girl in a holy aura like a giant halo. Two teenage boys were smoking on the opposite side of the front stairs. They were laughing about something. Victor got out of the car and opened his trunk. He checked his sup- plies. He hoped the rifle would not be necessary. He had never fired one. It was the same kind Hugo Herrera had used. He must have been quick, reloading and firing to kill five people without anyone stopping him. Too quick to almost be unbelievable. Why didnt anyone try to stop him? Because in those final minutes, everyone in that diner knew the bell of a special hour had rung. People spend lifetimes looking forward to things but when destiny catches up with them they are helpless. We are all helpless before the Great Plan. Victor caressed his backpack. The hunting knives were in there. Set of seven. Each sharpened and polished. Sometimes he stared at his reflec- tion in those blades and imagined blood traversing the grooves like open veins. He grinned. The teenage boys were gone. On the table, they left one dollar. Dad looked so sad and helpless that Mercys tears almost returned full force. When he began to apologize and call off the camping expedition, Mercy shook her head like Mom used to and said she was sorry, that she wanted to go on this trip with him, she really did. ""It wont be as bad as you think,"" Dad said. ""Its not going to rain."" He was trying. She picked at the remainder of her meal. Outside, the two teenage boys were walking across the parking lot to- ward the far end. Their tight jeans with the sagging butts looked ridicu- lous. They probably didnt have a car. Maybe been up all night drinking, talking about sex. They were assholes, but boys had it easier. Living the bohemian way came naturally to them. Ratcheting up sexual escapades like they were collecting baseball cards. Virginity was a grease stain needing to be wiped clean. Joel had not pressured her. He had given her intense physical pleas- ure. The first time he went down on her she was appalled and horrified, afraid he would comment on her smell, but those worries vanished in a full-body tingling sensation. She was nervous returning the favor and had done her best imitation of what a porn woman would do. Even after a month of similar exchanges, he denied her the full pleasure of his sex because he had found someone new and he didnt want to take advant- age of her. How wonderfully noble of him. ""We can talk about anything,"" Dad said. ""I know Im your father and that makes it weird sometimes, but I am here for you. I wont judge you."" He meant well but it made her feel even more like a little girl. She was supposed to be a woman, a college-educated woman, not some teen fret- ting over boy issues. ""I know,"" she said. ""Im thinking about Mom."" Ironically, talking about Mom was a preferable discussion. Dads face paled. ""It was hard. But you were so wonderful, honey. So strong."" ""Its fine, Dad."" ""No. I mean it. Without you, I would have fallen apart. My little girl saved me."" ""I was a mess."" ""You were so strong. There is a lot of your mother in you. I hope you know that."" ""Thanks, Dad."" Gradually, their solemn faces brightened until he made that stupid walrus face and she managed a giggle. Like when she had been young. The boys were almost at the far end of the parking lot where a small car with dark splotches of rust on its side waited, the trunk open. The guy from the bookstore was standing there, gesturing for them to ap- proach, like he had something really wonderful to show them. The boys came around the car on either side like jackals. All three stepped behind the open trunk lid. ""You dont have to keep things bottled,"" Dad said. ""Im just looking at the mountain."" Dad appreciated the view for a moment. ""A little bare right now but in a few weeks the trees will be lush. By then, lots of people will be up there. The trails will be littered with wrappers and plastic bottles."" Going up Blood Mountain was a rite of passage for many people in Stone Creek. Parents took their kids up there as infants. Boys shot their first deers up there. Teenagers gathered to drink and have sex up there. Or so she heard. ""This time of year is why the mountain gets its name,"" Dad said. The boys moved behind the curtain of the trunk. A jagged rust scar marked it like a battle wound on a soldiers face. ""All the pine trees. They start excreting around now. Change in the temperature or something. Sap is deep red. Tourists come to see it. The Great Bleed, its called."" Dad had been stumbling around the Internet again. In elementary school, kids said the mountain got its name from all the Indians that were slaughtered up there when the white settlers founded Stone Creek. In high school, the story had something to do with a hook- armed psychopath who liked to kidnap teenage girls up there. Hed rape them and hang them naked upside down from the trees. He would slice their throats with a hunting knife and watch them bleed out. Even a teacher once supported the story. ""Lesson is, girls,"" the teacher said, ""dont go camping."" ""The Great Bleed?"" she asked. She thought of the first time she got her period. Thankfully, Mom had still been very much alive. ""Its what they say."" ""Who?"" ""They."" ""Cant trust everything they say, Dad."" ""Youre sure you want to do this?"" he asked like she were debating getting on a roller coaster shed finally gotten tall enough to board. ""Yes, Dad."" Outside, one of the boys fell to his knees. ",candidate00001
1,00002,candidate00001,"She drove a silver PT Cruiser GT with a 2.4 liter turbocharged engine that could muster 220 horsepower at 5,100 rpm and featured an optional shifter so she could change gears or let the car do it for her. Stacy. That's what she named her PT Cruiser. It was her sister's name. I never felt comfortable in it, though. I claimed that the seats slanted forward, which they did, and that made me feel like I might topple out through the windshield onto the road, which it did, but that wasn't why I disliked the car. I disliked it because whenever I sat in that passenger seat (she always drove), the leather gripped my clothes like tiny hands and my lungs collapsed as though a weight were resting on me, or hands pushing me against the seat. ""Another PT stress attack?"" Tara would ask with a smile. I tried to pass them off some weren't as bad as others and smile back at her, but the pressure would mount on my chest and sweat would bead on my forehead; I'd grip the arm rest on the door and squeeze it un- til my hand turned numb. A few times I nearly started screaming, but the lack of air in my lungs and my self-assurance that this was some completely irrational reaction, perhaps to some long-buried childhood trauma, limited my vocalizations to quiet groans. Even with the window down and air pummeling my face and shoot- ing up my nose, my breathing did not improve. It never did, until I got out of the car. Once I stepped free from the car, slamming the door be- hind me, my lungs filled up and the sweat evaporated. I never told her this, knowing she would laugh long and hard at me, perhaps even have tears rolling down her cheeks, but I think I never liked that car because Stacy died in it. Technically, she hadn't died in the car. Only a day after taking the car off the dealership's lot, my girlfriend picked up her sister and took her for a drive. They talked about their family, about me, too, I suppose, about how Stacy was going to college in a few short weeks and how much fun she would have drinking and meeting boys without mom and dad around to judge her every move, how she would actually have good friends, not ones who betrayed her because they envied her intelligence. Then Stacy had said her head hurt, really bad, and then she collapsed against the door, limp. Tara laughed at first, thinking Stacy had only been exaggerating her physical exhaustion from dealing with their parents, but that initial misread turned quickly into frantic pleas and vi- cious shaking. Tara never forgave herself for laughing at first. But I don't think it would have mattered if she had realized right away what had happened and sped to the hospital. The doctor said it had been an an- eurysm something popped in her brain; Stacy had died in the hospital. But moments before, she had been in the PT Cruiser, limp but breath- ing, in the passenger seat. Tara would have laughed if I had propounded a supernatural theory about my PT stress attacks because Stacy had been a lovely, kind hearted girl who had liked me well enough, and I had enjoyed her company as much as I could have someone half my age. But Stacy had often been ostracized from her peers as I said; so, I think my theory may have held some credibility. Some sisters are close; others are practically one. Only a few weeks later, it was no longer a theory. Walking to Tara's car, I saw Stacy in the passenger's seat sitting there, head forward, hair blocking her face. I closed my eyes and walked closer. When I looked again, her head had turned to me, face pale, eyes red and swollen. I stopped, suddenly cold. ""PT anxiety hitting already?"" Tara asked. Stacy opened her mouth wide, wider than any human mouth could open-her teeth had turned completely black; bloody gaps marked where teeth had rotted away. Her eyes bloated into large teardrop orbs and she screamed at me. The scream did not pierce the air or make my ears ring, but it did turn my legs to Jell-O and my skin into a million squirming insects. Tara laughed I must have looked like a little kid being pressured into riding the monster rollercoaster. ""You can't stay here,"" she said. ""Bob and Vicki don't have a spare bed."" I looked from Tara to the passenger seat. Stacy's open-mouthed howl had drained to a defeated, sagging frown even her eyes drooped. Her skin rippled, liquefied, and fell away like a gush of tears. Tara got in the car and started the engine. I opened the passenger door and hesitated. Did the seat look wet? Did the air smell damp like a coffin beneath mounds of water-logged soil? ""You look sick,"" Tara said. I nodded. I eased my head inside the car; it felt incredibly hot and I immediately started to sweat. Tara sighed heavily. ""Stacy wouldn't want to make you uncomfortable, or hurt you,"" she said. She caressed the dashboard as she did my stomach when she wanted to help me fall asleep. ""Besides, Stacy loves you, doesn't she?"" Did she mean the car or her dead sister? ""Maybe I should ride in the back,"" I said. ""What? That's stupid. I'm not a chauffeur."" She smiled. ""Stacy likes when you ride up front so do I."" I took a deep breath and got in the car. The leather gripped me more firmly and the hands pushed harder, driving me back into the seat. I shut the door and tried to pretend the puddle in between my feet was from my boots. I would tell Tara what I had seen when we got back to our place. Then I'd give her the ring, asking her to marry a man who be- lieved in ghosts. I never got the chance. Side supplemental air bags come standard on the PT Cruiser GT; they are supposed to cushion the driver's and passengers' heads in a collision. And, in all fairness, they did protect my head when a motorcyclist crashed into the driver's side door as Tara had been turning out of Bob and Vicki's driveway. The motorcyclist had been nearing 100 miles per hour, evading the po- lice, when he gunned the engine even more around a blind curve. Tara had been looking at me when the motorcycle hit, and for that I am grate- ful. I saw a glint of sun bounce off the bike and then I lay on my side, head resting on a deflating air bag. Tara had looked to her left and then right and then smiled at me as she pulled out. I smiled back (trying to ignore the pressure on my chest) and I wish I could say I told her I loved her, but I didn't. She knew that, though. Our love had been so strong, so consuming like a giant comfort- er that you could wrap around yourself many, many times until you felt completely warm and safe. The speed of the motorcycle combined with the Cruiser making a left turn flipped the car on its side. When I realized I was against the road, head on an inflatable safety pillow, I looked out the windshield for my girlfriend. Broken glass and scattered pieces of metal was that the motorcycle's tail pipe? lay strewn across the concrete. Warm liquid dripped on my face. I looked up. Tara was still buckled in her seat, but her door had caved in, crushing her side-I couldn't see her left arm or leg. Her head sagged toward me; blood dribbled from her green eyes. I screamed and everything went black. And in the darkness, Stacy's gaping mouth hollered at me and then quickly melted to sagging, quivering lips and watery eyes. I awoke in a hospital. Understanding. I had suffered a broken right arm, fracturing it against the arm rest that I had gripped during my panic attacks. Tara and the motorcyclist had been killed on impact. Her parents came to the hospital and we cried together. Her mother held me and we sobbed on each other's shoulders while her father sat in a folding chair and stared at the wall as though he were looking through it; tears fell steadily from his eyes. ""Both my babies,"" her mother cried against me. ""They're both gone."" I know and I'm sorry, I wanted to say, but such statements sound so stupid, so insignificant. ""I want them back,"" her mother said. ""I need them."" She kept crying, often uttering her daughters' names, but those words stayed with me, seeped into me and grabbed hold, tattooing me. I want them back. Two police officers arrived sometime later and asked for my account of the accident. I told them everything except how the blood dripped from Tara's eyes that image would be mine forever; regardless of the pain it caused, I would shoulder that image alone. ""If you think of anything else,"" the larger of the two officers said, ""please call the station and let us know."" I expected a business card, but small town cops don't have a need for such things. The smaller cop offered a slight smile, the kind you put on when the scene was tragically morose, but you were more or less indif- ferent. They started to turn away but I stopped them. The larger cop looked at me, eyebrow rising. ""The car, her car... "" The cops looked at each other as though this were a rhetorical question but perhaps this guy had been too shocked for it to register, maybe he didn't even realize his girlfriend had been killed, been nearly sliced in half, actually. ""Well,"" the bigger one said, ""it was totaled."" ""Yes, but... "" ""We got plenty of pictures,"" the smaller one said as though he were re- ferring to his family's trip to Busch Gardens. The bigger cop glanced at him and then turned to me. ""You'll get a copy of the report. Your insurance company can get a copy also; they can call me, too, if there's a problem."" ""I appreciate that,"" I said. ""But where is the car? Right now."" They looked at each other. The smaller cop flipped open a notebook. The car had been brought to Kane's Car Deposit, a modest junk pile of crushed cars and scattered car parts set on a section of dead grass on a back road just outside of the county. I made my way there via a blue and green taxi that stank of cigarette smoke; small holes with singed edges speckled the back seat. I told the cab driver to wait just in case the car wouldn't start. ""It's a junkyard,"" the man said. Dotted with splotches of ketchup, his white T- shirt stretched over a formidable gut. ""They don't bring cars here that can get here themselves."" I nodded, told him to wait, and walked inside a small garage that smelled of oil and flatulence. Throbs of pain pulsated in my arm every few seconds. I should have filled my prescription first. The office was small and cramped. Various bolts and screws lay on scattered yellowed papers on the reception desk like tiny paper weights. A rusted radiator sat in the only waiting chair, which had been torn in several places as though from an armed and angry customer. A glass partition separated the office from the garage; thick dirt streaked the glass in swirls. A large man in a faded green T-shirt sat in a smaller back room at a table eating a sandwich over tinfoil. A radio squawked a sports show of some kind from somewhere in the room. I looked for a bell to get the man's attention, but settled for knocking on the front of the desk. The man turned slowly, a piece of tomato hanging from his lips. ""Hello,"" I said. ""I'm looking for a car."" The man stood slowly, his knees needing to accept the considerable girth of the man's middle section before walking, and slurped the rest of the tomato into his mouth. He made his way to the desk with heavy feet. ""We got lots of cars,"" he said. He dropped a swollen hand onto the desk; it creaked beneath it. ""But most of 'em don't look like they used to."" He laughed. I chuckled with him briefly. ""I'm looking for a car that was brought in earlier today-a PT Cruiser."" The man nodded several times; wads of skin shook below his chin. ""I know just the one. Motorcycle crash. Totaled. Cops just dropped her off."" ""Could I see it?"" The man clicked his tongue in his mouth a few times. ""Why you want to do that?"" I raised my arm in its cast. ""'Cause I was in it during the crash."" The car had been dropped off inside the garage so that it could be stripped for any usable parts before being crushed. I have never known much about cars, what I know about Tara's PT Cruiser-the specks, anyway-I got from the Internet, so I didn't know exactly what totaled meant. The entire driver's side had been pushed inward, the metal ripping at the point of impact. It looked like a missile had hit it. In a way, I guess one had. The front had crumbled with the side and the roof had col- lapsed as well. Only the rear passenger tire hadn't gone flat-the front driver's tire was completely gone; a mangled disk of metal protruded from the wheel well like a disfigured fist. ""You think you left something in there?"" the man asked. ""Cause the cops said they cleaned the car out for personal stuff."" I looked at him. ""Can they do that?"" His face twitched. ""Think they were just being considerate."" ""Right,"" I said. ""Sorry."" I stepped to the crushed driver's side. I leaned forward and stopped just short of putting my head through the open window frame. Blood spatters stained the gear shift and both of the seats. I felt the warm liquid dripping on my temple. I touched my forehead and rubbed the sensation away. The aroma of Tara's body spray, a mix of vanilla and peaches, lingered inside the car like the wisps of memory that hang around the corners of your brain long after an event has passed. The door was ajar. The edge had been torn and bent. I touched it, ex- pecting it to be hot, maybe even scalding, but the metal was cool. It had just been a change for the metal that constructed the car as it had been a change for me-once whole, now mangled and irreparable. The man stood at the front of the car, hands joined on his enormous gut. ""Not much usable from the body,"" he said, ""but there's some parts inside: engine parts, some transmission... "" He continued with his list while I opened the driver's door; it creaked loudly, metal grinding against metal. ""Surprised they didn't use the jaws of life,"" the man said. ""Had they, you wouldn't have to open a door to get in; wouldn't be a door there at all."" Jaws of Life. An ironic term for something that would have been used to free the dead. I stepped forward and leaned inside the car. ""Surprised you only broke your arm,"" the man said. ""Accident like that... Luckily to be alive."" I looked at him through the windshield that was no longer there. ""Yes,"" I said. ""Lucky to be alive."" The smell of peaches and vanilla intens- ified as though she had just been here. ""Good thing you came right away cause we're probably gonna crush her and throw her in the graveyard tomorrow. Send the money to the rightful people, though."" ""Graveyard?"" I asked. He made a thumbs up sign and pointed over his shoulder, behind him. ""Out back. Where all the cars end up. You'd be surprised how many people come around wanting to scavenge through there."" I imagined this car flattened to a rectangle with damaged wheels. I saw all the people climbing on it and over it, either searching it for some desperately needed piece or using it as a rung on a ladder to get to a dif- ferent car corpse. The smell got stronger. I breathed deeply, closing my eyes. I felt Tara's hair touch my face as it so often did when we slept, my arms around her. ""Are you Kane?"" I asked. ""The owner?"" He laughed, belly vibrating. ""No. He's probably off somewhere count- ing all his money and seducing all kinds of women."" ""Didn't know the car crushing business was so glamorous."" ""Ain't the business; it's the man,"" he said. ""Just like with a car. The vehicle doesn't make you glamorous, you make you glamorous."" ""Interesting,"" I said. Had he gotten such insight from a roast beef sand- wich and sports talk radio? ""I'd like to take the car back,"" I said. The man looked at me as though I had said I wanted to rebuild it; hell, that's what he probably believed I meant. I glanced at the dried blood stains on the driver's seat, what was left of it anyway, and got inside Tara's PT Cruiser. The man walked around to the driver's side. ""You want to take it back? Home?"" I put my left hand on the part of the steering wheel that remained, gripping it as I had seen Tara grip it so many times, fondly, affection- ately. ""Yes,"" I said. ""That's exactly what I want to do."" ""But why?"" Was this such an uncommon occurrence? I supposed it probably was; who wanted a totaled car, especially the one in which their loved one had died? ""You believe in ghosts?"" I asked. He stared back at me. Blinked. I didn't think he would understand. I paid to have the car towed back to my house, the house I had shared with Tara for three years. I left my car in the driveway and had the PT Cruiser put in the garage. I didn't want people seeing the wrecked vehicle, thinking I was holding onto it because I couldn't let go of Tara. And I didn't want them to watch me. I sat in the car for a few hours the first time. I touched the steering wheel as I had at the car dump. I inhaled deeply; the smell of Tara's spray faint at first as though the tow over here had destroyed it, but then it came back stronger and stronger. I could have gotten her spray from inside and made it even more so, but that would have been fake; that would have been covering reality. Something pushed on my chest, forcing the air out of my lungs. Sweat popped along my arms, the skin beneath my cast itching furiously. I tried to breathe, but the pressure intensified; the invisible hands pushed harder. I felt my face turn red, straining for oxygen, for the pressure to be re- leased. Tears rolled out of my eyes. Then a cool wind passed over me and the pressure vanished-my body cooled. I shut my eyes and saw her smile, saw it fill her face and clear her eyes. That made my heart jump, that look. I ran after her and she fled, laughing like a little girl. I found her and took her in my arms and said, ""I love you."" I removed the jewelry box from my pocket and set it on the dashboard: white gold, emerald cut diamond. Just as she had wanted. Later, I returned to the car naked. I sat in the driver's seat and took a deep breath. I shut my eyes and felt her hair on my skin, felt her fingers touch my own, felt her lips against mine, felt our bodies press together. She kissed her way down my neck and over my chest to my lap. She took me in her mouth and sucked on me, eyes peering up at me. I cried as I came. I didn't tell anyone about the car-not her parents, or mine, or any friends. None of them would understand. They'd tell me to see a coun- selor. Well, maybe not all of them. Tara's mother might understand. She might understand all too well. Death happens. We all must die. I know that. But death doesn't always mean the end. I sit in the car for hours; sometimes I sleep in it. Some- times I see Stacy in the passenger seat, laughing, smiling. And sometimes, when the smell of peaches and vanilla is really strong, I don't think I'll ever get out of it. I think I'll just stay in the PT Cruiser until I'm a part of it, too. ",candidate00001
2,00001,candidate00002,"I write this sitting at a desk, wind serene about me, clouds forming and unravelling in beautiful shapes above me. I write this, and you are forgiven if you don't see the shakes in my hands, or notice the hurried scrawl of my writing. I write fast as I have no idea when he might come back to me. According to my watch, it has been three days and roughly six hours since I last held him, and fourteen hours since I last saw him and heard his voice. I'll be back, Dad, he had said. And I believe him. So I wait for him still. There are noises in the far distance. Weird, animal hoots and growls, and I am certain they are of a kind I have not heard before. The wind smells faintly of cut grass and faintly of rot. I do not know which I prefer, because cut grass reminds me too vividly of home, and sunny, perfect days on the lawn with my son, throwing Frisbees and kicking balls. I can close my eyes and imagine the silk of his translucent yellow hair. I don't close my eyes too often here, because when I do, the sounds and smells become all the more real, as if I am compensating for the loss of one sense by heightening my others. And so I make the very things I am trying to avoid all the closer. When I try to look for the source of the sounds, it is as if my eyes suddenly cease to focus, and the far distance becomes blurred and pale, as if seen through mist. Only when I return my gaze to the desk do things become sharp again. My son has been gone for over three days, have I said that? I heard him speak those final words after two and a half days searching, and as I called out to him, spinning to look in every possible direction, I was sure I caught a glimpse of his bright red tee shirt. Then it was gone and I am now not so sure I saw anything. I'll be back, he said. And so I write, waiting for some sign. Waiting for the courage to follow those sounds into the far distance and find my boy. He first showed me the ladder on the day after his eighth birthday. We have a large oak tree at the bottom of our garden, standing monolithlike on the edge of a large but unkempt lawn, all other plants and garden ornaments placed in such a way that they seem to draw the eye to it, although this is wholly unintended. This particular day, my son was standing in front of the tree, looking smaller than ever, and I can still see the way the dappled sunlight played on his face, soft ripples of light turning his hair white and then darkening to a caramel blonde. I loved him more than ever at that moment, I think. If only I had done things differently. You may read that line more than once in this confession? Yes, confession fits. Around the tree was an old garden seat, its deep green paint long ago weather-faded so that it almost seemed part of the tree. It curved around the tree about a third of the way round, and as I watched, my son stepped up on it, reaching to touch the ladder that folded itself around the front of the tree, then continued a curve around its massive girth, ever upwards. It vanished from sight into the branches around the back. I had never seen the ladder before. I stared. My son turned to face me, a look of wild excitement on his face, and even across the distance I could see the sheen in his eyes and the wind in his hair. I think that the look he had is saved specifically for eight year old boys, when every event becomes adventure, every darkness becomes a monster-filled cave, and every anomalous ladder simply another thing to climb just because it is there. The look said, Can I climb it, Dad? Can I? I started towards him, a look of concern obviously showing, for he dropped his hand and stood on the seat, barely able to contain his jittering. I approached the tree, ruffling my son's hair as I passed and I looked closely at the ladder. As I think back on it, it is a surprise even to me that I felt no shock at seeing it there. It was as if I convinced myself it had always been there and I had just never seen it. It seemed to begin somewhere at the back of the tree, out of sight, its rungs organic and woody, laced with delicate ivy, slick with old moss. I stepped slowly to the side and followed it around the tree. It seemed to curve forever upward and as I stood at the back, it yet again disappeared out of sight, this time around the front of the tree. And there was no sign of its beginnings. I stared. I told myself I had just been at the front of the tree and the ladder did not reappear there as it surely must, looking at it from this angle. I hurried around the tree, following the ladder as I went, and I found myself again at the front, seeing the original perspective. Then again around to the back of the tree where it vanished into the branches. It seemed that wherever I began following the ladder, its origins were out of sight, and it disappeared into the branches at either side. It was the most perplexing optical illusion, and I followed it two more times, coming up with the same conclusion each time. What is it, Dad? my son asked. I grinned at him (and that grin I now feel was the start of it all, as if I had given his excitement the fuel and permission it needed to grow. God, had I but known.), and shrugged, feeling like an excited child myself. I had an idea, and I asked my son to run in the house. He did, dutifully, and I spent the time he was gone walking round and round the tree, following the ladder with my hand, losing it as it became too high, but marking the height of its disappearance and time after time I marvelled at the way the ladder just seemed to begin again at that height (which was always about four feet off the ground) without being visible on the opposite side. My son returned. In his hand he clutched a red crayon, and I took it from him and began to retrace my steps, this time running the crayon along the edge of the ladder. When the ladder became too high to comfortably reach, I marked the height by running the crayon along the trunk itself, picking up the ladder again at the front, impossibly at the same height as it always had been. By the time I had walked around the trunk a further four times, there were five clear lines of red following the ladder's progress. I must be stooping as I reach the front, I thought as I made a sixth journey. But, no. I wasn't. I dropped the crayon. It hit me that the sensation was like running my hand around the sharp edge of a giant screw that was boring its way into the earth, so that, give or take depending on my speed around the tree, the height of my hand on the leading edge of ladder remained the same. But, unless I was having a massive leap away from all my senses, the tree did not seem to be boring its way into the earth. I was stumped. You may think that the next logical step was to mount the thing and follow it upwards. Of course. But we didn't. Not then anyway. I ushered my son away from the tree, distracting him with promises of ice cream and movies and for a day or two, we almost forgot about the ladder. And then he climbed it. He was up it and gone before I knew what was happening. He had a glazed look on his face as if something had called him, hypnotising, and as I ran towards the tree, calling his name so loud that my throat was still hurting three days later, I saw him turn to look at me only once. The look I saw there chilled me then and does still, as I relive it for this account. He looked at once as if he knew exactly what he was doing, and at the same time as if he was being pulled away from all he knew and loved, and his face screamed to me to stop him. The pleading I saw in his eyes, desperate helpless pleading as if it was a stranger on the ladder pulling him upwards rather than the power of his own legs, forced my own legs into a paroxysm of power and I cleared the distance to the tree in seconds. I was too late however, for as I reached the trunk and followed the spiral steps around it, I caught a glimpse of his shoe as it disappeared into the leaves. And then nothing. I ran, I circled the tree hopelessly in the vain hope that I would see him up in the branches, a cruel trick. Of course, I saw no such thing. The ladder wound terminally onwards, ever spiralling, each revolution of the tree seeming to launch it into its ascent anew. Of my son, there was no sign. It was as if he had vanished. I screamed his name up into the branches, scanning their depths for a sign of him, but I saw nothing. The leaves continued their soft waving, and the breeze sighed through them and for a moment I imagined his voice calling me. I thought my heart would break at that moment. I gathered myself for the ascent, and had even stepped onto the bench at the tree's base, when I heard his soft step. I saw one foot, then the other and I stood paralysed, waiting. Of course, it was him. His hair looked ruffled and was flecked through here and there with seeds and grass. There was a flush to his cheeks, the exuberant glow of a child at energetic play. I reached up to him, snatched him off the ladder and threw us both to the ground, sobbing and clutching him tightly. He was silent, and he shook, I presumed with fear, but as I separated us, and held him at arms length for the admonition that had to come, I saw he was shaking with laughter. Indeed, he seemed paralysed by it, tears coursing down his grubby face, his white teeth shining through the redness of his moistened lips. His silenced ended suddenly in a gasping inrush of air, and I heard the familiar cackle of his laughter. Despite myself, despite my fear and coldness that still caressed my bones, I smiled. The smile grew and I began to laugh with him, caught up by the infection rather than for any genuine humour. I felt his admonishment dissolving in that sound and I hugged him close. Finally we stood and I looked close at him, the laughter subsiding, his eyes trained first on me, but ever glancing towards the ladder, quick and furtive. What happened? Where did you go? I asked him, feeling foolish but unable to rephrase the question so that it made sense to me. Dad, why didn't you come with me? was his reply. It was fun. Loads of fun! I must have frowned at this, for he focused solely on me for a moment. What happened up there? I asked again. I just played! But it was so much fun, Dad! he replied. The chill of fear began to return, and God help me, for an instance I looked at my son and I swear I had to stop myself looking for the birthmark at the crown of his skull for proof that it really was he who had returned. But you were only gone for seconds! I said feebly. Don't be silly, Dad. he said as he walked back to the house, absentmindedly brushing grass seeds from his hair. It was hours. Two at least! Why didn't you come, we could've played together?! He left me standing at the base of the oak tree, speechless. In a fit of foolishness, of reckless curiosity, I asked him that night of what he had seen, of where the ladder had ended. I wanted to know. The ladder doesn't end, Dad. I got off in a field and played there for hours. The sun was shining and there was grass and trees and footballs and everything! I asked him what he meant when he said the ladder doesn't end. I mean it keeps going. It just carried on until I couldn't see it anymore. Round and round and round the tree. It must be a long walk to wherever it really ends. Do you want to come with me, Dad? he asked. I said no, and that I never wanted him to go back there. I said that we have trees and grass and footballs and everything he would ever need or want right here. I said that the ladder was dangerous and that until we knew what it was and where it came from, I didn't want him anywhere near it. He reluctantly agreed, and yet his next words confirmed to me that it would be hopeless trying to keep him away. OK, Dad. I'll see if he can come to play down here. I stared at him. Who's she'? My friend, he said. My God, I remember thinking. Just how long was he there? For me it was a matter of agonising seconds, but he is talking like he had hours to play and to even make friends. Just who the hell was up there? Is up there still? That night, after my son had gone to bed, I took a glass of wine outside and sat looking at the ladder in the failing light. I walked cautiously down the garden, and felt immediately foolish doing it, and sat with my back to the tree. I shut my eyes and tried to relive the afternoon's events. I found that the panic and fear I had felt was slipping away (although I wasn't sure that it wasn't the wine helping me in that regard). Had my son really been gone for hours, instead of the seconds I had experienced? I even contemplated the notion that I had had some kind of seizure or mental block. I drank and as the sun set and the darkness really set in, I heard the noise. It was like the soft hooting of an owl, which would have been no surprise, but it sounded like it was from another place. By that I mean another I can't describe any of it without sounding like a mad man. It sounded so ethereal and distant that it could have been coming from another dimension. It didn't sound like it occupied the same space as the other natural sounds around me, the cars and the wind and the rustle of leaves above my head. I can't explain it any further. I unconsciously shifted my position so that I half faced the tree and I looked upwards into its darkness. I could see almost nothing of the ladder itself, save for the few feet directly above my head, but it seemed to be emitting light, the faintest fluorescence, its passage through the trees marked with a blue aura. Whereas the solid ladder seemed to vanish into the tree, this aura seemed endless, and looking up at it was like looking into a spiralling image reflected from mirror to mirror, over and over. It had no end that I could see. I coughed, more to break the unearthly silence that had descended, and at that sound the haze vanished and I was left looking up into the tree like some deranged night-time bird spotter. I shook my head to clear it and went back inside, but not before the faint hooting started again. This time it was accompanied by hissing and growling that came from nothing I could imagine, nor would want to. Despite myself, by the time I reached the back door, I was moving at a healthy jog. At breakfast the next morning my son has a wild-eyed look about him, as if the dreams of the night were with him still. I asked him about them, and he said nothing. I saw him glancing past me, through the open kitchen window. Down the length of the garden. I said nothing of my experiences of the previous evening, not the eldritch light, the noises, the feeling of impenetrable depth up into the branches. As I cleared away the breakfast things, I watched my son play in the garden, thinking that to deny him access to the garden and the ladder would only increase his desire to get there. There was an almost deliberate skirting around the tree and the area surrounding it, but I did not fail to notice the looks he shot towards it. I wasn't so far away that I could not hear him catch his breath each time he came within four feet of the tree. My heart caught at each of his stopped breaths and I imagined myself running from the kitchen, just too late to grasp his heel as he disappeared into the tree. He showed no inclination, however, of climbing again. I began to relax and brewed some tea. I carried the drink into the garden, along with my usual weekend newspaper, and selected the bench at the top of the garden to begin my week-long perusal of it. I had been reading for perhaps ten minutes when I sensed rather than heard a change in the dynamic of his playing. My heart stopped and I stood suddenly, lukewarm tea spilling into the grass. A large drop fell onto the paper, where it ran the ink like blood from a bullet hole. I stared at my son. He stood at the base of the tree, one hand resting casually on the leading edge of the ladder. His hair blew in a wind, but the wind seemed to blow downwards, as if it was coming from directly above him. He nodded slowly, and a wide grin split his face. He spoke, but the words were lost to me. They should not have been. I should have been able to hear him clearly, but I couldn't. I started towards him, shouted his name, Walk towards me! It seemed he heard me at the last moment, turned to me, and as I saw the look on his face, I broke into a run. It was the look I had seen the last time he had climbed. Pure fear. He seemed to be imploring me to catch him, stealing glances up the ladder so that I was sure he was seeing something up there. He spoke a word, and for the life of me, I was sure it was not English. I have not heard its like before or since that moment. Its guttural bubbling sound was utterly alien coming from my son's mouth. I saw his eyes roll upwards until they were white, and as he started to slump forward, I threw myself at him in a vain attempt to catch his fall. I was beaten to it, however. A long arm snaked downwards, fastened on a shoulder, and pulled sharply on my son's body. The hand at the end seemed too long, and thinking back now I know I that I had convinced myself that I saw pink flesh and dark dusting hair on the back of it, and not that dark indigo scaling horror. I know now that it was no human hand that snatched my son. I collapsed onto the grass and stared weakly up into the depths. I saw nothing. No sign of my son or the thing that had taken him. The worst thing of all, perhaps, is that apart from that crawling malevolent word he uttered before he fainted, my son made no noise. There was no cry as he was taken, no sign that he even knew what had happened. Good god, I wasn't even sure if he was alive. I sobbed into my cupped hands and raced back to the house, my first instinct to phone for help. I stopped myself with my hand in the receiver of the telephone. What on earth would I tell the police? That my son had been snatched up into the canopy by some monster that used a never ending ladder as its route through the tree? They would take me away as soon as look at me. I walked in a daze back to the tree, fearful now that I would see my son's slumped body at its base, drained of life, and the creature (if that is what it was) crouching above him. The area around the tree was free from such visions and that was somehow worse. I reached the ladder and craned up into the darkness. Nothing. I started back to the house, desperate to do something, knowing there was only one thing that I could do. I fought with myself for minutes, precious minutes that I knew could mean the difference between finding my son and not. I curse those wasted minutes now. Fast, so as I could not stop myself, I rushed back to the start of the ladder, and leapt the first three rungs, running up it using feet and hands. At first I did not take in my surroundings, but it soon became clear that I should have easily cleared the height of the tree, and hadn't. I slowed my ascent, and looked to either side. I saw a vista so strange and alien to me that I nearly lost balance on the rungs of the ladder. Unthinking, I stepped from it and the ground beneath my feet seemed to thrum as I made contact with it. The earth here was a deep shade of ochre, nothing strange in that, but the grass shooting through it was the colour of spun glass, transparent and yet catching the dull light and throwing out spirals of twisted rainbows in every direction. I reached my hand to it, and snatched it back quickly as the edges parted my skin like razor blades. No playground this, then. As much as I wanted to stay and explore, despite the obvious challenge, I knew (and prayed) that my son was not here and so moved on up the ladder. There seemed no end, each rung a door to as new and equally alien a landscape as that first. A breeze ruffled my hair. I smelled something in that breeze, familiar. It smelled faintly of ice cream and heat and joy, and I recognised the scent of my boy. Like a dog after a trail, I moved my head this way and that, until I thought I had detected a lightly stronger scent off to my right. I shut my eyes to focus on it, and stepped off the ladder. It felt like stepping back onto the land around my house. Smelled the same too. There were noises here, as those I had heard from the base of the tree, hooting and exuberant whistles. I opened my eyes, and saw the table off to one side, the one I am sitting at right now, sitting in a patch of bare ground. The earth was the red colour of the Australian outback. To all sides, I saw fields upon fields of deep yellow corn, alongside tall trees that stretched into infinity. Beneath all of it, the redness of the earth looked like sunburned skin from which the corn grew like hair. I though I saw movement in the corn, shadows and flitting shapes that leaped and cavorted among the dusty stems. I stared harder but this only served to blur the edges of my vision and so I looked away. On the table I saw a pen and paper. Hooked over the back of the chair that accompanied the table, as casually as if it had been at home, was my son's jacket. I rushed to it, expecting to find something, some warmth in its cloth that would give me a clue. It was cold, and as I drew nearer, I saw splashes of mud coating it. I grabbed it up and crushed my face into it. I shouted my son's name again and again until my voice cracked and failed me, the sound thinning as it raced across the expanse. Clouds of dust and dried corn husk rose from the fields as if in response to my calls, but I neither received, nor expected, further reply. I sat heavily at the desk, feeling the chair creak under my weight, and spread my son's coat out in front of me. I absently picked at the flecks of dried mud, thankful it was not blood. I looked down at the red ground, not wanting to see the way my hands shook, not wanting to see the way they looked in the pallid yellow light of this place. My mind was filled with voices, all clamouring to be heard, all saying one thing or another, all mine. I bit down hard on my lip to snap myself out of this destructive thinking. Blood slowly filled the gap between my lower lip and my teeth and as I tasted the bitterness of it, my eyes found something on the ground at my feet. A tiny depression in the hard soil, no more than a fingers length. A swirling pattern in the middle of it, concentric circles the size of a small coin. I jolted in the chair so hard that my thighs caught painfully on the underside of the desk. I stood suddenly, tipping the chair backwards, and still clutching my son's jacket, I sank so that my face almost touched the earth. The voices in my head quietened suddenly. I knew this pattern. I had seen its like rendered numerous times in mud on the floor of my kitchen. It was my son's shoe print, I was sure of it, and now that I had seen one, I seemed to see them all. Some were only traces of the print, some more full, and they led in a weaving pattern away from the desk and into the cornfields. What my eyes also found, and what I tried to not see, were the prints next to them, crossing them, scuffing them out. They looked vaguely bird like, long and slender with three distinct trailing scratches at the front each, as if made by three claws dragging with each footstep. I stood and looked around. Apart from the desk and the ladder shimmering blue in the air next to it, all was red earth and yellow corn. Without stopping to think, I tucked the arms of my son's jacket into my jeans and started following the footprints. The going was hard, strangely so, as if the very ground was holding me back. My feet seemed to drag, and I had the strangest thought that if I possessed sharp claws, they would leave that weird little dragging scratch in the earth like the ones I was following. When I looked down at my feet I saw that the redness of the earth had crept up the legs of my jeans almost to the knee. I thought, no, I knew, that when I looked away the ground would be reaching up again, grasping my legs, slowing me down. I called out my son's name suddenly, not liking the hoarseness of my voice, but calling again anyway. A flock of birds exploded from the cornfield, black as crows but twice their size at least, oily blueness shimmering from their wingtips in the low sun. They were a way off too, and I had no desire to see them up close. I watched them depart with no little relief. I allowed myself to think that the noise they made as they flew, the barking calls they made unlike any crow I had ever heard, the hissing as their wings exited the dry corn, completely masked the call made by my son as he answered me. Despite their racket, I almost heard him, I am sure of it. If I had made the sound up in my head, would I have added details like the obvious sound of his distress, and the low guttural rumbling that could only have come from his captor? I began to run then, mimicking the birds' flight with my own, obliterating the footprints and the claw prints, tearing my legs through the grasping soil, seeing a red rain of dust flick from the ends of my shoes as each left the ground. The low rumble that I imagined was the voice of my son's kidnapper grew louder and I almost thought I saw a flash of indigo scales as it sped away through the corn field. I screamed as loud as I could manage as I ran, the name of my son becoming indistinct, morphing into a single strained syllable of wrenching pain. I thought I heard him again then, all trace of the hypnosis he seemed to have been under gone and simply fear and anger and sadness and loss remaining. I urged my legs to move faster and sensed the ground under my feet responding to this as the creeping redness reached to my knees and then further, clawing at my thighs. Still I ran. Hours passed, or seemed to. My watch was still running, but I wasn't sure I could trust its timing. In the blink of an eye, hours would pass, and then time would slow so that I seemed to cross vast distances in mere seconds. I heard the shuffling steps of the kidnapper at every twist and turn of the corn plants, and as they slowly merged and then vanished into forests of deep green trees, the sounds grew quieter and eventually stopped altogether. I slept when I literally had no strength to stand, but the sleep was fitful and seemed to last no more than minutes. My watch said differently however, and a day, and then two seemed to pass. I felt time's progress in the growth of stubble on my face, but in nothing else. I did not eat and I drank what water I could find in the forests, praying I would not sicken before I had found my son. It was perhaps two days, or maybe two and a half when I eventually saw him, I was so shocked that for a moment I didn't recognise him. He stood some distance from me, on the edge of the forest as it turned back to the red dusty ground. I was close enough to see streaks of tears cutting through the dirt on his face. Close enough to smell him. He stood with his head bowed, and as I scanned around for his tormentor, I saw nothing. I looked back to my son, heart racing, words drying in my throat, and I reached for him. He caught my eye suddenly, and the look in his eyes stopped me cold. It was blank fear, and yet he seemed to be telling me something with tiny movements of his head, shaking this way and that. He looked to his right and then left and again shook his head. I saw a grimace of pain cross his face then, and he crumpled slightly. As I looked to either side of him, and he was lost to the periphery, finally I saw what he was telling me. From the corner of my eye, I saw. The creature was not gone. It stood, its many-jointed, bowed legs dripping moisture and a glistening swollen sac of a body depending from them, its arms wrapped around my son, scaled hands at his throat. It shrouded itself somehow from me, so that when I looked back to my son, it vanished. And yet now I had seen it, I couldn't un-see it. I gagged with the fear and revulsion, with the pain of seeing my boy harnessed by such horror. The thing tugged at him and he stumbled against the soft body. A mouth opened on its flank, more a raw wet hole than a mouth, but from it issued the same gargling sounds I had heard my son speak in the moments before his abduction. I wasn't sure if it was talking to me or my son, but I saw him nodding gently, and I sensed his fear subsiding, or at least abating for the moment, both in his eyes and the set of his body. His hands, that had been fisted tightly this whole time, slowly unclenched, and I was close enough to see tiny white crescents on his palms where his fingernails had dug in. Go back, Dad he said, and my heart stopped at the sound of his voice. Go back to the ladder and wait for me. I began to protest, but days with mere mouthfuls of liquid had turned my voice into a silent scratch and I'm not sure he would have heard even if I had continued. As it was, he held his hands out and implored me. Dad, please! Go back. Wait at the ladder and I will find you. I'll be back, Dad. I promise. I love you, and I'll be back. Now GO! The creature wrenched my son onto its back suddenly and now I saw it fully. I gagged again and started running towards the spot where they had been standing, but I was too late. They vanished in a cloud of red dust, and I heard him shout as they went. I'll be back, Dad I sank to my knees and watch them leave, the dust settling just enough for me to glimpse the bright red of his tee shirt before it was shrouded in distance and mist and dry, cracking corn plants. My raw cry of loss followed them where I could not. I am back at the table, back where I began my story. I wait for my son as any father would. It took me less than a day to find my way back, and I followed what markers I could remember and what footprints remained. The birds were back in the cornfield, their cawing and flapping sounding like the crackle of fire in the dry vegetation. I hold in my mind the sound of him and the sight of him and the smell of him, and I know he will return to me. He promised and I believe him. There are sounds in the distance, have I mentioned that? They seem to be getting closer. I have moved the desk right to the point where the ladder is visible through the trees. I had a moment of inspiration and tied his jacket, which miraculously remained with me this whole time, to the last rung of the ladder that I stepped off. I think I might search for him on further rungs and in further worlds, or even go home. Just for a while, and I know now, or think at least, that I can find my way back here. I have written my son a note explaining what I have planned, but he promised me, and I believe him. I'll be back, he said. I need to be here when he does. The jacket, still tied to the ladder, is flapping in a soft breeze. It reminds me of home, and the sound, like a kite or a flag in summer, comforts me. Every few minutes, I leave off writing and walk a distance and start calling my son. So far I have heard nothing, but he promised. ",candidate00002
3,00002,candidate00002,"Sunlight dapples my eyelids. My eyes ache more than ever now, and with each new dawn I wake with dread. It is cold too, this morning. A thin layer of frost glues the edge of my coat to the pavement, spikes my hair into messy peaks. I run a hand though it, and hear, in the dead quiet of morning, soft crackles as the spikes dissolve. My nose is icy; my cheeks feel red and chapped. I sit up slowly, aware of pains that are too numerous to single out. The cold smoothness of the glass behind me is running with rivulets of freezing condensation, but it prevents me from falling. As I stretch my legs out, hearing the pops and cracks of my stiff joints, I see that the gloves I am wearing are tattered, both thumbs poking rudely through. I smell terrible, I am sure, but I have long since lost the ability to judge my own odour. I draw up my legs and hug them close to me. The city is still asleep at this hour, and I revel in the quiet. The sun begins to rise, and I imagine that it rises just for me. It is beautiful. I can never forget the desperation of my situation, but I have learned to push it away, hide it in some cloistered corner of my brain, where I daren't yet mine. My thoughts turn slowly, inevitably, to breakfast. I smile. I have a nice smile, and I am lucky that I still have all my teeth, my skin is clear and smooth, and that my hair is not too unkempt. I am lucky that people still find in them some measure of pity, and I need that. I don't eat all that often. You have to learn to live on very little, sometimes nothing. I read of a man who survived for over four months on water alone. I try not to better that. I stand and stretch. The sun this morning is truly wonderful. There are long, grey morning shadows, and where they land, small patches of glistening white frost. Everywhere else, it melts quickly. The street lamps flickered out two hours ago, and such is the time of year that they will be flickering back to life in eight or nine hours. My feet are still cold, and I shift them into the sun, stamping lightly. I am not happy, and yet something keeps waking me in the mornings, keeps me going through the motions of day after day. The same thing that has kept me going for nearly thirteen years. I'm not sure what that something is, but I am sure I will know it when I see it. It is waiting for me. I am standing on a pavement running the length of a quiet city street. My hair is long, my beard thick but relatively un-matted, for I comb it and my hair regularly. I am wearing tatty shoes that have lasted me for ten years or more, and here and there they are held together with strips of plastic bag and parcel tape. Of my three pairs of trousers, I am wearing my worst. The other two are folded into the bag I use as a pillow. Also in the bag are several tee shirts. Over all this I am wearing a dark green ex-army jacket that I found in a skip. It is lined with fake fur, although I am sure that was never army issue. Most of it is hanging torn and shredded like giant cobwebs. I look up and down the street. There are few awake, one or two early rising shopkeepers. I see one now, scurrying like an oversized ant to and from his shop, arms laden with fruit boxes. My mouth begins to salivate. I walk towards the shopkeeper, and as they almost all do, he keeps his head down, content to know of my existence but ignore it. I kick a soft drink can down the road in front of me, and it isn't until I hear the muted rattle of its passage, that I fully realise the depth of the silence. My breath makes soft white plumes in the air, and I walk through them. The open shop is very close now. The shopkeeper looks up and sees me coming, then looks quickly away. I think that it is possibly because my eyes resemble those of a wild animal, a wolf perhaps. I stuff my hands deep into the pockets of my jacket. The shopkeeper mumbles something incoherent, and I try to be friendly. I nod my head and mumble back. No words, just cautious sounds. I see his arm move suddenly, in a blur, and realise he has thrown something at me. Or rather, to me. My hand snatches the projectile from the air with scarcely a thought, and I break into a wide toothy grin as I feel the cold crisp hardness of an apple in my palm. It is as big as a baseball, red and shiny as fresh blood. I thank him with real words this time and laugh. I bite into the apple, and it is lush and sweet. The juice runs into my beard, but I ignore the stickiness for now. For a moment I can forget where and who I am and enjoy my breakfast. It is over too soon and I throw the core and pips into a dustbin. My hands thread their way back into my jacket pockets, for although it is slightly warmer in the sun, there is still a bitter wind curling its fingers around me. There is a bit more life to the city now. My watch has been broken for four years, but I can guess the time pretty accurately. It is around seventhirty. I see my first car of the morning. Its exhaust belches oily blue smoke, and I watch the plumes twist and cavort in the cold air, thin tendrils reaching after the car like dead hands. I cough deeply, not liking the deep rattle that follows each hacking cough, or the moisture welling in my eyes.. The apple has left tiny slivers of skin between my teeth and I find a park bench and spend a few happy moments picking them out. The street meets with the main road here, and at all four corners of the junction, I can see the city open herself up to me. It spreads as far as I can see. I stretch my legs and drop one on top of the other. For a while, I am content. The sun warms my face and I turn to it, closing my eyes. The city is truly a magnificent place, and here is its true beauty. Here at its heart. Cars appear from nowhere, roaring past, their numbers increasing into a flowing metal stream, the faces of the drivers merging, becoming one face, parts of it content, parts irate, parts distant, as if the people have far more worry on their minds than they outwardly show. I watch them pass. The last piece of apple comes loose and I grind it between my teeth with childish satisfaction. I have been here long enough to nod off, I think. It is perhaps nine o'clock, probably a little before. The air is humming with life. People travelling to work, to shop. Ah, for those luxuries. I used to work; only now I can't remember where. A woman sits down next to me. At least, she is on the same bench as me, but is sitting as far away as she can manage, stuffing herself into the corner and studying her fingernails as though they were priceless jewels. I turn to look at her and my heart stutters. I know this woman! I can't place her name, but I know I was married once. Jean, or Jane. Is this her? I look again and she looks back. I see her face full on. It is not my wife. My heart is beating fast and I grin stupidly. I am sure I appear a madman to her, grinning through a thick swatch of dirty beard. She moves hastily on, as the world does. Her perfume does not share her haste, and hangs lazily in the air. It tickles my nostrils and I fight with a sneeze. It wins. I stand and turn to meet the nestling of shops before me. Which way? I choose straight on because it seems less effort that way. As I walk, I find I am thinking of the woman. Who is she? I ask myself out loud. A couple shoot quizzical looks my way but I ignore them. I must seem no different to the hundreds of babbling tramps that wander this city. My eyes are open but shock flares them wider. My heart races. I think I am wetting myself. A noise, blaring louder and louder until it threatens to split my ear drums, is drilling its way into my head. I can't place the noise, but suddenly something snaps and it is clear to me. A car horn. I turn to my right and see the car, its grille, like bared teeth, inches from my leg. In the air is the bitter sting of burning rubber. The angry driver is yelling, but the volume of the horn has temporarily deafened me, and I can't make out the words. I have walked blindly out into the road. Before waiting for me to move, the driver wrenches his car around me, an angry squeal of tyres. I trot quickly to the other side of the road, and rest my weight on a lamppost, breathing heavily. My heart bumps and jitters under my ribs and my legs quiver as if they are about to drop me to the floor. I feel coldness as the air hits the wet patch at my crotch. As I calm, the reality of what happens hits me suddenly. Was I really that close to death? I begin to cry as the relief washes over me. On the tails of relief follow shame and desperation. Would anyone care if I had died? I mean, really care? Still hitching breath, I manage to hobble away past shops and shops and shops. As I walk, a thought hits me so violently that I stagger in the street. What if I had been killed back there? What if the driver hadn't seen me, hadn't stopped? Would it be better if I were dead? I list everything I would miss, but the truth of it is I would miss very little. I force the thought away. My knees have stopped their ragged shaking, my heart beats normally. My chest feels abused, raw, but I manage to draw breath. Sleep comes easily when you are homeless, and comes easiest of all when your belly is empty and your body is drained of nutrients and vigour. I find a large tree, this one still frosted from the cold and I wrestle myself into the confines of its buttresses. My bag serves me again as a pillow and I wrap the tattered remains of my coat around my legs, which I have curled under me. My dreams are as ever horrid scaly things invading and tormenting me. I am dreaming of cars, of great shining grilles with teeth that threaten to unravel me. I dream of death and I dream of a man. He has become a friend to me, in past months, and yet I never see his face. I know I twist and contort myself in sleep, but no one cares. I am left to my nightmare. i am standing in sand up to my ankles it is cold and bites into me as if every grain was gifted with bristling needle teeth wind whips around me but i have no coat nothing to warm my freezing skin as i look down at myself i see i am completely naked my skin is peaked infinitely with goose-bumps blue with the cold there is nothing to see the dreamscape is as desolate as i always feared it would be dunes upon dunes of billowing sand white as if sun bleached but there is no sun the wind drops but the cold remains as if it is within me i start to walk forward i think but there is no front or back here north is as south is as east is as west up is as down i appear as white as the biting sand motionless emotionless a man is walking towards me now out of the distance he has always been there waiting my dream-self it is the friend i have had in every dream i can remember i am jealous of his robes that drape across his wide shoulders of the cowl that protects his face from the sand the sand always the biting sand i know that if i were to remove that cowl he would appear as i do my twin i laugh he echoes the sound his laugh is dead flat cold coming across the wastes of sand i raise my hands and he copies i am drugged my limbs heavy i fight it and it is winning the man beckons and i walk towards him passing oceans of bleached sand still the man remains distant always the same number of footfalls away from me he is walking away as i walk towards and yet we are facing each other he stops tilts his head i tilt mine and i wonder who is leading who am i him? is he me? my nakedness is covered now by a robe like his and we could be as one i draw back the hood of the robe hoping he will do the same as i watch the man finally draws the cowl from his own head and i recoil unable to stop myself it is plainly me i am looking at the same awkward tilt to my mouth the same deep set eyes the same wide cheekbones and high forehead and where my own face is bristling with beard his is clean no hair on it whatsoever i see the reason suddenly he is burned this version of me horribly burned so that his face appears nothing more than a pasty mass of scar tissue i could be looking at death itself and then it smiles at me the scars bunching and stretching horribly around the mouth and eyes i scream my own face wrinkles in sympathy and i feel i could reach right to him and pull the mask off if i were to do so i would see myself underneath i reach towards this hideous parody expecting it to retreat but it doesn't expecting myself to finally wake but I don't suddenly I am next to it a reverse mirror image of it of me breathing the reek from it from the glistening maw that is its face its eyes have gone it no longer looks human like me its arms are wizened claws and they clutch at me so violently I am thrown off my feet my lungs seize and breath is expelled in one long desperate gasp it reaches again for me its wizened arms reaching higher and higher until it grasps my throat tightly I gasp as it pushes my head down I present the crown of my head to it wait for the killing stroke it doesn't come it takes my skull strangely soft into its putrid maw it melds to the contours of the thing's palate my chin is resting on its tongue and i can hear the boiling acid in its stomach i vomit at the stench of it i can see down the throat down the oesophagus that is a wasted tube of dead flesh the pressure from its grasping hands relaxes considerably but i do not try to pull my head from its jaws i feel a profound loss every time i move so i remain still push my head further in blind now to the sights and smells of it and it begins to feel warm and soft sensual almost i am an infant now the baby is crying and i know that it is crying not through fear or hunger but rather because everything it has ever known the womb the warmth has been wrenched from it cruelly because it knows that all it will experience now is pain dirt excretion hurt i hear a deep laugh beginning in the creature's gut my laugh of course as i realise who it is who i am death and now this feeling i have as i kiss the insides of the creature's mouth rub my face into the soft tongue caress the fleshy softness i recognise it as the feeling of being born back to the womb back to the sensual protective darkness that begins life and inevitably must end it i reach my hands up and the jaws open wider to accommodate me i start to clamber frantically inside using my legs to push deeper it seems impossibly big as i begin to disappear into the putrid blackness suddenly the mouth shuts behind me and i am left in pitch blackness i yell hawking great lungfuls of stinking air to fuel my cries as a great snaking umbilical cord wraps itself around me and i writhe against its greasy pulsing length suddenly it grows tight and pulls me in the mouth starts to tip me forwards i know it means to swallow me and i feel tingling anticipation it means to end my life or begin my death it is the same i reach into the throat meaning to pull myself further in i encounter rows of viciously serrated teeth i pull my hands away from the pain and find them hopelessly ruined and torn a violent tipping of the tongue and i am gone deep deep into the cave of its throat deep into myself for we are one and the same the teeth rake at me i am a foetus curled and defenceless i smell the pit of its stomach feel splashes of the acid on my face and arms before i die i hear the laughter again then nothing Then I am awake and it is afternoon. The sun is sinking already so I know it must be at least four thirty. I stink of piss and I must have vomited in my sleep. I see there is blood in the mess beside me. I feel strange. Never in my thirteen years as this vagabond have I felt such peace. I feel terribly warm, and yet I can see from the hats and scarves, and from the frosty plumes of breath around me, that it is cold. As I stand and stretch, I realise suddenly what it is I have been searching for these years. It pops into my head as sharply and audibly as a snapping twig. I am looking for Death. Quite simply. I have lived this life of misery for too long and I am sick of it. Sick of the hunger, the cold, the thirst. Sick of the danger, the withering stares and the illness that are constant bed fellows. I am lonely and desolate, all I have or once had is gone, extinguished like a fragile flame. I have the answer now. Death awaits me, reaching to me with arms that promise peace and calm and happiness. It is so simple. I shrug off my coat and stand in the chill of the winter evening. I feel no cold. I laugh and laugh. As I walk from my bed, I slip my arms into my jacket, preferring the ease of wearing it to the clumsiness of carrying it. The air has become cold, and I can almost taste the thinness of it. The idea of dying does not fill me with the cold dread it once did. Instead, I feel a longing for the peace that has evaded me for as long as I can remember. The grass crunches under my feet. The frost has returned, and I prepare for a cold night. I begin to think of food; begin to return to the routine of finding food, eating food and finding shelter. I then realise that I have other plans ahead, and that finding food and shelter need not figure in them. The man in my dreams surfaces in my mind again, shrouded and darkened behind his cowl. I long for his final touch. I find another tree and lie beneath it. I have vague memories of trying to kill myself once. Seven years ago. Perhaps I knew then what I know now? What I desire now? Perhaps not. Stolen headache tablets, spread in a pile like a tiny snow-capped mountain. I remember the sound they made as they tumbled and clattered against one another. Swallowed slowly, one by one, washed down with a half bottle of vodka. My hands were steady, and my heart a peaceful rhythm. It comforted me as I prepared for my death. How many heartbeats left? Three hundred? A thousand? Ten? Nothing seemed to happen for a long time. I dozed and woke with metronomic regularity, and then There was light suddenly all around me, and pain stabbed my gut like a knife. My face contorted with agony, eyes flared and mouth frothed like a horse in the throes of madness. The brightness changed. Occasional flashes of colour, too bright for me to register. My head seemed to lift from my shoulders and there was a roiling in my gut. Vomit spewed across my legs. Black in the moonlight, presumably with blood. Still my head rose and I felt I could turn to look down at my thrashing, spasming body below me. My stomach rose and fell rapidly, and with each new contortion, a fresh gobbet of vomit spattered me. My head sank suddenly without warning and by degrees the contortions slowed and stopped. Sudden blackness. I fell to my jacket and let death take me. And yet I woke and lived. And lived. The memory is now too much for my fragile mind. I am sick, violently, fall into blackness again. I become aware of the warmth of the sun on my face as I wake. I realise with some dismay that I am still alive. I'm hollowed out, like a shell, my innards wrenched from their moorings like so much crab meat. I stare at the splatter of vomit across my legs and see undigested apple littering the dark redness like stars in a dusky sky. Tears wet my cheeks as I try to stand and fall back, weakened. Death won't come for me. I know that now. I will have to find Death. Urgency lifts me. I must do this. I realise I am chanting this mantra. I must do this. The city is alien, death everywhere suddenly. I feel like a tourist, death's tourist, among the throng. All seems strange to me, as if I hadn't looked it every day of my life for thirteen years or more. My head feels crushed and my neck and stomach muscles feel stretched, violated. I feel cold without my coat. I stagger across ever busying streets, mindless to the traffic, the screeching tyres, wailing horns. I walk through crowds of people that aren't there. Dark roads lead off the main street and the perspective of the houses that line them draws me into their darkness, like a wooded path in a fairy tale. I take the furthest one from the bustle of the city. Front yards and pavements are littered with the corpses of deceased bicycles, shopping carts and old shoes. Windows in the houses nearest the entrance to the road are clean and sparkle in the sun. Further in they are either smashed or boarded over like wounds. I encounter few people. Those that I do see avert their eyes. Soon enough I stop looking at them and walk. Hunger gnaws at me pointlessly. At the last house on the road, facing me before a broken fence and miles of increasing dark, the door hangs limply open. A mattress juts like a tongue, and the windows are half lidded with yellowing net curtains. As if I have been led here, my heart quickens as I walk up the path and enter the house, the first I have been in since leaving my own The stench of the place hits me like a slap, and I reel, noticing as I do the discarded needles like a glassy snow drift in one corner. I walk in a fugue through to what I presume is a sitting room and pain flares suddenly, violently in my head, ringing at my temple. My legs collapse and I am dead weight on the carpet. A man is standing over me, a torrent of words escaping him, or so I imagine. I seem to have gone deaf and the blow blurs my senses. The pain fades as the man hits me again. I have time to study his face, pocked and drawn, a cheese-white blot with hollow eyes like burns. I see a flash of metal. The man berates me further, although I am still deaf to his ranting. I try to tell him I have no need for his drugs but he hits me again, and follows that with a flurry of kicks, surprisingly solid despite his apparent frailty. The metal flashes again and I have time to register a blade. Just. Heat blooms in my chest and I see I am skewered. Blood oozes slowly around the handle and coats the blade. I laugh. The man withdraws the knife, and I recognise and appreciate the look of horror on his face. Can I thank him? If only he knew. I try, between giggles. Everything blurs again and the pain seems unable to creep through the fug. My laughter further enrages him and he stabs me again. Pain now as the blade slips delicately between ribs into my heart. A sickening release and blood courses from the wound. Greyness edges across my vision, and my last true sight is of the man turning, dropping the knife. I watch the blood slip from its gleam as it lets go its hold on my fluids. Blackness. There is the sound of my heart beating its last and then there is nothing. No sound, no sight, no feeling. It is as if I have ceased to exist, except that I am somehow aware of this fact. I suffer a moment or two of this nothingness and then I feel cold biting wind and hear the rustle that I know is the sound of grains of sand knocking and jostling over one another. i am standing in sand up to my ankles it bites i as if every grain was gifted with bristling needle teeth in front of me is my twin its jaws drop wide and i begin my climb into the maw once again the smells and sounds of death affront me and to accent them is the throb where the drug addict's knife ended me i lay my head on the glossy tongue stroke my arms wide across it it becomes as a second coupling with a new lover no less exciting anticipative but less anxious and fearful familiar i rub my face and torso into the floor of this cavern i curl like the foetus i am becoming and begin sucking on my thumb i almost cry out as i feel the greasy umbilical cord join me to the twin who swallows me a pulsating movement underneath and the floor of the cave softens further blackness begins to drop from the fleshy walls as the mouth decays around me i sink a way into the tongue as it rots it starts to tip me down the throat and the teeth begin their work anew tearing me and pulling me in i cry out and attempt to withdraw my arms are caught and are shredding pain washes like fire and i scream i manage to release myself somehow i am free for seconds until my legs are snagged on the grasping teeth that seem to have life my legs are stripped of skin and then of flesh as they are pulled further in i scream again and beg for it to stop but of course it doesn't not when my chest is punctured not when the teeth reach my neck and tear at the skin there it doesn't stop when the umbilical tears loose sending viscera spilling hotly down the rotting tube of its throat and when the pain seems to have reached its peak it doubles and triples and magnifies by multiples of thousands as my skull is crushed by the peristalsis within the rotting tube of its throat my brain presses against the bone briefly before being forced out through nose and mouth and ears i moan no longer able to scream how am i still aware i beg again for it to stop and still it doesn't and it swallows finally i boil in its acids a fleshy pulp and still unmercifully aware to the end of my pain and plight i have no form only feeling and so am forced to experience my own dissolution digestion excretion this last fills me with such anguish that i scream and scream and scream silently once out of the creature my soul turns and watches as the creature slinks away no longer pretending human form i can make no sense of it i hang in the air over a pile of this creature's shit in the mess are clearly definable shapes a femur here ribs there caging a domed segment of my skull as i watch the wind picks up and the shit starts to crumble already drying the bones crumble with it crumble into dust into into into suddenly it hits me My death is nothing. No pleasures. No sensuality. It is not the comforting womb that I believed it to be. It is simply a cold, biting desert. My bones have vanished. I make the connection. I realise. If I had a heart, and it hadn't already been pierced, surely it would burst. The creature has tricked me. This desert is death. It is nothing more or less than the powdered bones of billions of tricked souls just like me. He has shit them all out to rot and crumble among the bone-white sand. Bone-white because it is bone. And here I am too. I fear I will never be unaware. Mercy will not visit me. Or rather, us. I can hear so many others crying with me. I am no different now. My death is a grain of sand in a desert. My crying joins the cacophony and it is a horrible sound. ",candidate00002
4,00001,candidate00003,"When Clem Jenkins walked into the bait shop with that big red cooler, we all knew what he was up to. He was the best fisherman in the county, and he was about to prove it to us again. ""Catch anything?"" one of the customers at the minnow pool asked as Clem lugged the cooler over to the scales. Someone snickered. ""Of course he caught something,"" someone else said. ""He always catches something."" ""Just gather round boys,"" Clem said so everyone would hear, ""and I'll show you what's biting this morning."" Truth be told, a small crowd had already formed around the scales. Clem seldom disappointed us, and today would be no exception. He flipped open the top of the cooler, and stuck both hands inside. He paused for a moment for dramatic effect. ""Get on with it Clem,"" Bill said with a touch of envy in his voice. Clem grinned at him. ""Anybody here interested in bass fishing?"" he said, knowing that that was about the only thing most of us were interested in. ""Well boys, feast your eyes on this."" Clem stood up and the room fell silent for a moment, except for Fred who let out a long, low whistle. ""Jeez, Clem, that looks big enough to take the state record,"" I said. I didn't even try to hide how jealous I was. ""It looks big enough, but it ain't. State record's 15 pounds, two ounces. This baby weighs in at 14 and a half."" We all agreed that it was still a respectable catch, and Jim went behind the counter to grab the Polaroid to commemorate the event. Jim always posted pictures of the big catches on the wall behind the cash register. There were a few of me up there, but pictures of Clem and his trophy-sized fish dominated. ""Hell Clem, why don't you come back when you've caught a big one,"" I teased. It was only 9:30 and there was still a good two hours of fishing left before the water got too warm. ""Nah, I decided to quit early today. It just didn't seem right to catch all of big ones and not leave any for you guys."" The guys laughed. I did too, but I couldn't let him off that easy. ""Some of us might have a chance to catch one of those big ones if you'd ever let on where your secret spot is."" ""There is no secret spot, Charlie, the secret's in the bait."" Several people nodded in agreement. ""Clem you know that's not exactly true. We all use the same bait."" Clem was formulating his answer when we were interrupted by the bell on the front door. Everyone turned to look at the newcomer. He was tall and built like a man who spent most of his time behind a desk. He was dressed like the cover of an Eddie Bauer catalog. ""Yes sir,"" Jim said. ""Can I help you?"" The stranger took the scene in for a moment, then said ""Yeah, the lady at the motel said I could hire a guide here to do some fishing."" ""Well, she told you the truth. What kind of fishing are you looking to do?"" I could see the question confused him. I could also see that he was going to try hard not to let on. ""Uh, I read that the Bass fishing up here is really good."" ""It sure is,"" Jim said. ""You after small mouth, or large mouth?"" Some of the guys had to suppress a grin. The newcomer was what we called a weekender, a tourist who liked to swing down from the city and spend some time away from it all. For the most part we didn't really mind the weekenders. We needed their money. The only problem was, some of them knew it. ""Which one is biggest?"" the weekender continued. ""Large mouth,"" Jim said. ""Clem here just caught one that weighed over 14 pounds."" By now, Clem had put his fish back in the cooler, and was busy gathering his things to leave. The weekender looked over to Clem. ""Well, how about it?"" he asked. ""How about what?"" Clem answered and bent over to pick up his cooler. ""Are you a fishing guide?"" Clem was a licensed guide, and a good one, too. But he didn't like working for weekenders. Clem stood up. ""Yeah, I'm a guide, but my schedule's full right now."" The weekender looked a little surprised. He seemed like a guy who was used to having things his way. ""Well, I'd be willing to pay you something extra to find some time in your schedule."" Clem looked uninterested. The weekender checked his watch. It was a Rolex. ""Look, I've got some things to do today. Why don't you just take a deposit, and I'll meet you back here at 3 to work out the details."" Clem started to say something when the weekender pulled out two crisp hundred dollar bills. He folded them in half, reached out, and stuffed them in Clem's shirt pocket. ""See you at three,"" he said, and walked out the door. After he left, Jim spoke up. ""Can you believe the nerve of that guy? Driving up here in his Mercedes and acting like he owns all of us."" Bill wasn't too pleased either. ""Screw him, Clem. You don't need any money from guys like that."" It was strange, but Clem was the calmest of all of us. ""It isn't anything to get worked up about fellows,"" Clem said. ""The guy wants me to take him fishing, so I'll take him fishing."" Clem and I spent the rest of the morning getting things ready for the trip. Clem had his own boat, of course, but mine was in better shape and had those nice padded seats that Clem liked so much. We had lunch together at the diner, and made it back to the bait shop in time to load up the boat with supplies. Jim always stocked plenty of beer and sandwich fixings at the bait shop. Plus, Clem and I both qualified for the 10% fishing guide discount. We were outside making the final preparations when the weekender pulled up. He drove a Mercedes alright, but it was the sport utility model. It looked out of place next to my rusty Ford pickup. The weekender got out and walked up to Clem. ""Glad to see you've found some time,"" he said. ""What do I need to take with me?"" Clem said he'd need a license, and might want to buy some bug spray and sunscreen. ""You can buy everything inside,"" Clem added. ""Fine. How much are we talking about for this trip?"" I smiled. It was always the guys who threw money around who were the most concerned about the price of the trip. ""Trip costs $300. That includes all your gear, plus dinner. I'll also clean and filet any fish you catch, and pack them so you can take them back with you."" The weekender made a face. ""No thanks,"" he said. ""I hate fish. If it's big enough, I'll have it mounted. Otherwise you can just throw them back."" Clem didn't look surprised. ""OK then, let's get you a license,"" Clem said, and walked into the bait shop. Inside, Jim already had everything laid out. The weekender filled out the license application and paid the fee. I walked back to the storage room and came back with the blue cooler. ""What's in there?"" the weekender asked as I struggled through the door. ""Bait,"" I replied. ""Everyone around here knows the secret's in the bait."" The answer seemed to satisfy him. Everything was all loaded up, and I was sitting in the truck by the time Clem and the weekender came out of the bait shop. They climbed into the front seat. Clem had to sit in the middle, but it didn't matter because we weren't going too far. I tried to start a conversation, but was interrupted by the weekender's cell phone. ""Yeah speak up I'm on vacation fishing no Monday or Tuesday "" It went on in that vein for the rest of the drive to the lake. The boat lauch went smoothly and we were all on the lake by five. I drove the boat, and Clem baited the hooks. The first place we tried was a bust. Clem got a few nibbles, but the weekender and I didn't even get that. We moved on to a second spot. The sun was getting low in the sky. ""That's good for us,"" Clem said. ""The fish start to feed again in the evening."" We settled in, and in just a few minutes, Clem got a solid strike. He was paying attention to the weekender, though, and didn't set the hook in time. ""Damn,"" Clem muttered, ""got my bait."" The weekender was starting to get antsy. ""At least you got a bite,"" he complained. ""I've been out here with you for two hours, and haven't even gotten that."" He stopped short of asking for his money back, but Clem and I both knew that he was about to. ""Let's try one more place,"" Clem suggested. We reeled in our lines and headed out across the lake. It was almost dark, and I had to navigate by the lights of the town on the far shore. ""This is good here,"" Clem shouted over the buzz of the motor. I reached out and cut it off. The lake was beautifully calm, and Clem made his way to the front of the boat. He pulled out a flashlight and shined it onto his rod and reel. The weekender picked up his rod also. ""I'm out of bait,"" he said. Clem tossed him the flashlight. ""Here you go. Bait's in the blue cooler."" The weekender leaned over and popped the lid of the cooler. I watched his face as the light from the flashlight shined inside. I could see his wide eyes, and I hit him hard with the oar before he had a chance to scream. Clem looked at him for a second, then rolled him out of the boat and held him under water for a few minutes just to be sure. It was pretty late by the time we made it back to the bait shop. Jim and a few of the guys were waiting for us. ""Catch anything?"" Jim asked. Clem smiled. ""Biggest one yet."" Several heads nodded. Clem paused for effect, then added ""The secret's in the bait, you know.""

5,00002,candidate00003,"Buzz! All eyes in the office looked up at the red light on the intercom speaker. ""Johnson! Get in here!"" a gruff voice boomed out. Six workers breathed a sigh of relief while the seventh felt a tight knot forming in his stomach. Buzz! ""I meant now!"" the voice boomed out again. ""You better go Joe, you know he just gets worse the longer he has to wait,"" Betty the secretary whispered across her desk. ""How can he get any worse?"" Joe said over his shoulder as he headed towards the door. Buzz! Joe knocked loudly. ""It's about time!"" a voice yelled out from behind the door. ""Get in here!"" Joe rushed into the room. Before he could do anything, his boss shouted again. ""Close that door!"" Joe shut the door gingerly and prepared for what had become an almost weekly ritual. ""I've got your sales figures in front of me Johnson,"" the boss pointed to a short stack of papers on his large, executive-style desk. ""And I've got to tell you that they are pathetic with a capital 'P'!"" Joe reacted to each of the spat out syllables as if they were gunshots. ""Yes sir, Mr. Miller, but,"" Joe began. Miller cut him off. ""Don't 'but' me. I've had about enough of your loafing around here. I hire salesmen to sell,"" he raised a finger and pointed it at the quarterly sales chart on the wall for emphasis. ""And if you can't handle the job, I'm going to have to find someone who can!"" He stuffed his unlit cigar into his mouth and chomped down on it angrily. Joe stood silently for a moment, trying to gather his thoughts. ""But, Mr. Miller, I've got a family to support,"" Joe said in a plaintive voice. ""So do I Johnson,"" the boss interjected. ""So do I. And if I don't see an improvement out of you by next week's report, you're fired, or my name isn't Larry Miller!"" ""But,"" Joe stammered. ""No buts! Now get out!"" The boss pointed at the door behind Joe. Joe knew a good opportunity when he saw one, and he didn't waste any time getting out of Mr. Miller's office. Outside, his fellow workers tried, unsuccessfully, to pretend that they hadn't heard what had transpired. They all sat nervously, desperate for Joe to say something about it first. Betty was the first to break the silence. ""Don't take it so hard Joe,"" she said softly. ""We all know how he can be."" ""Thanks Betty,"" Joe said weakly. Six pairs of eyes followed him back to his desk and watched as he plonked down in his chair and started to shuffle through the papers on his desk. They were polite enough not to say anything else. On the way home that evening, Joe's mind was racing. ""What am I going to tell Karen?"" he asked himself over and over. ""What am I going to say?"" As he was imagining how he would break the news to her, he suddenly remembered the shopping list in his pocket. Karen had asked him to pick up a few things on the way home. ""Oh great,"" Joe thought. ""I've screwed that one up too."" He was too far along to turn back to the store now. He pulled the list out of his pocket and read it between brief glances at the road. ""Hmmmm. Eggs, butter, apples, flowers,"" Joe read silently. Joe resented that Karen had written ""flowers"" on the list. It was a reminder that he had been neglectful of her and the kids lately. But, he rationalized the guilty thought away quickly. Between his job and his boss, he didn't see how he could do things any other way. ""Besides,"" he added to his mental explanation, ""it's my paycheck that is buying the stuff on this list."" With that thought, Joe looked up in time to see a handpainted sign on the side of the road. ""Cain's Apples- Farm Fresh Produce- 2 mi. ahead,"" Joe read as he sped by. ""Well, at least I can get one thing on this list,"" he decided, and put it back into his shirt pocket. As he crested the top of a hill, Joe could see the apple stand in the distance. It was a little larger than he expected, which surprised him because he didn't remember ever seeing it there before. He pulled on the shoulder, turned off the engine, and looked at the stand for a moment. It had two signs in front, a large on that said ""Cain's Apples,"" and a smaller one that said ""Open"" in large red letters. It looked as if the farmer had just brought in three white sheds on a big truck and dropped them off in the middle of the night. A small generator was off to one side, and it had a cord attached running into the back of the first shed. Each shed had baskets of apples neatly arranged on shelves, with small signs indicating the variety. Joe hadn't seen anything like it around the area since he was a teenager, and the sight of it brought back fond memories. Joe checked his pocket for his list, got out of the car, and walked up to the stand. He was in luck. The generator was loud and powering a small refrigerator. A sign on top said that they sold eggs and butter. There were also several bunches of flowers in a big water can on a shelf. They were daisies, Karen's favorite. ""Can I help you?"" Joe was startled by a voice behind him. He turned and looked at a man he assumed to be Mr. Cain. Joe thought his bright blue eyes didn't match his tanned and weather-beaten face. ""Oh, hi, do you have any eggs or butter left?"" Joe asked somewhat nervously. ""Don't know,"" the farmer said in a friendly voice, ""let's take a look."" He stepped past Joe and peered into the refrigerator. ""You're in luck,"" Cain said from the back of the refrigerator. He pulled his head out and looked at Joe. ""How many do you want?"" ""Just a dozen of the eggs, and I'll take a pound of butter if you've got it,"" Joe said. ""Sure, sure,"" the farmer answered in his calm and slow voice. ""Anything else?"" Joe looked over at the water can. ""Yeah, um, how much for the flowers?"" Cain smiled knowingly. ""Two dollars a bunch."" ""Great,"" Joe said, imagining the pleased look on Karen's face. ""I'll take two bunches."" Cain wrapped the purchases in brown paper before placing them on the small table where he had a metal cash box. He looked at Joe. ""Something else?"" The way he phrased the question made it sound as if he knew that there was. Joe pulled out his list and read it again. ""Oh yeah, I also need some apples,"" Joe said when he was done. ""What for?"" Cain shot back. The question threw Joe. ""What do you mean?"" he managed to ask through his confusion. Cain saw the problem. ""No, I mean what will you use them for, cooking or eating?"" Joe seemed relieved. ""Oh, cooking. My wife wants to bake an apple pie."" Cain looked pleased. ""I've got just the thing, let me show you."" He led Joe a few feet over to shed number three and pointed at a tub filled with small green apples. Joe eyed them suspiciously. ""What kind are they?"" Joe asked. Cain hooked a thumb under a suspender and rocked back slightly on his heels. ""Well, these here are hard and sour,"" he began. Joe started to shake his head. Cain raised his hand. ""Now hold on, you're probably thinking about eating apples. These here are for cooking."" Joe listened politely. Cain continued with some enthusiasm. ""For pie, you want a firm apple, one that's not too sweet. Otherwise, you'll end up with applesauce instead of apple pie once you add the sugar and put it in the oven."" The logic appealed to Joe, and he told Cain he'd take two pounds. Cain packed everything in a cardboard box and handed it to Joe. Then he carefully added the prices on a little notepad and handed the result to Joe. Joe paid, thanked the farmer, and carried the box back to his car. He was about to drive off when he remembered his original question. He pulled closer to the stand, rolled down the window, and called out to Cain over the noise of the generator. ""Hey, Mr. Cain!"" Cain turned around. ""The apples, what are they called?"" Cain leaned forward and cupped his hands around his mouth. ""Larry Millers,"" he said. Joe paused for a second with a puzzled look on his face. He started to say something, but then thought better of it. The generator was too loud. With a wave and a nod, he drove off for home. The turn for Joe's house came sooner than he expected. He was distracted, thinking about the events of the day, when he saw the sign announcing ""Welcome to Shady Brooke."" He turned right, past the manicured flower beds and the ornate fountain, then made a left into his culde- sac. Joe remembered the look on Karen's face when they first moved into the neighborhood. The house and the mortgage were both too big for them then, but two children soon took care of the first problem, and his current job had taken care of the second. Joe shook his head slowly when he thought about what to say to Karen about the events of the day. It wasn't going to be easy. ""I'm home,"" Joe announced, closing the door behind him with his foot. He set his box of groceries on the table and looked out the window in the back yard. Karen was engaged in a heated discussion over the fence with Fred Kimball, grouchy neighbor extraordinaire. The argument ended abruptly, and Karen walked inside, looking a little worse for wear. ""Oh, hi,"" she said, slightly startled to see Joe standing there. ""When did you get home?"" ""I just walked in,"" Joe answered. ""What did he want this time?"" ""Fred's complaining about the fence and the property line again,"" Karen answered in a tired voice. She looked behind him at the table. ""You remembered the groceries, thanks."" ""Yeah,"" Joe replied, ""I found a fruit stand on the way home. The guy there told me that those apples were good for baking."" Karen was examining one closely. It passed her muster, and she transferred the whole batch to the counter. ""These are fine,"" she said. She didn't mention the flowers. ""How about an apple pie for dessert?"" Joe smiled wanly. ""Yeah, that would be great."" He spent the rest of the evening watching television and chatting with Karen about her day. At dinner, he avoided telling her about his problems at work. ""Why tell her now?"" he thought, ""It will only make her worry."" Karen could sense something was wrong, but chose to ignore it. She didn't like to discuss important things in front of the children. After dinner, she brought her fresh baked pie to the table and carefully cut a slice for each of them. The family agreed that it was delicious. Joe slept fitfully that night, and left for work 15 minutes earlier than usual. He wanted to make sure he would be on time today. He arrived a few minutes early, and had already made his first call of the day when Betty came in looking agitated. ""What's the matter?"" Joe asked with some concern. Betty was one of his few allies in the office. ""Joe, haven't you heard? Mr. Miller's had a stroke."" Joe looked at her with wide eyes. ""Really? When?"" ""Last night around 7:30. He's in the hospital now."" She started to choke up. ""They don't think he's going to make it."" Joe's grave look hid the sense of relief he felt inside. ""A stroke? Miller? Ha ha, this is almost too good to be true,"" he thought, before catching himself. Aloud he said in his most sympathetic voice, ""I am so sorry to hear that."" Betty acted as if she didn't hear him and sat absentmindedly at her desk. Joe returned to his and waited for some word. It came a little after two. Larry Miller died at 11:15 am from complications following a severe stroke. Betty took the phone call. The office closed early because of the news, and Joe was on the road by three. On the way home he contemplated the new turn of events. ""I still can't believe this,"" he thought with excitement. ""I'm off the hook."" With Larry Miller dead, Joe figured his job was safe, at least for a while. He was thinking about how glad he was that he didn't tell Karen when he saw the sign out of the corner of his eye. ""Cain's Apples- Farm Fresh Produce 2 mi. ahead."" With a chill, Joe suddenly remembered what the old man at the stand had sold him. Larry Miller apples. ""He knew,"" Joe said half-aloud. ""He knew."" Stepping hard on the gas peddle, Joe raced to the fruit stand and brought his car to a halt in a cloud of dust and gravel. The sign in front said ""Open,"" but Cain wasn't there. Joe called out. ""Hello! Anybody there?"" No answer. He looked behind the sheds and was about to leave when he heard a familiar voice behind him. ""Can I help you?"" Joe wheeled about and saw the same bright blue eyes and the same weathered face. ""You startled me,"" Joe said. ""Sorry about that,"" Cain replied with a warm smile. ""What can I get you today?"" Joe pondered his reply for a few moments. His thought about the apples began to seem silly to him. The generator was still banging away in the background. ""I'd like some apples,"" he finally said, sheepishly. ""Well, we've got apples,"" Cain said with good humor. ""What do you need them for?"" ""You like tart apples, or sweet ones?"" Cain asked as he rummaged through a large tub. Joe watched carefully as the old man grabbed several apples and held them up for Joe to see. ""Well mister, tart or sweet?"" Joe weighed the choices. ""Tart,"" he said all of a sudden, without quite knowing exactly why. ""You'll like these then,"" Cain said and started filling a bag with scruffy green apples. ""They're sometimes a little bitter, but for the most part they're very good."" Mr. Cain finished filling the bag and handed it to Joe. ""That'll be $1.50,"" he said, and opened up his little metal cash box. Joe paid him. ""One more thing,"" Joe said hesitatingly. ""What are they called?"" Cain's blue eyes lit up, and he smiled slightly. ""Pahchay,"" he said. ""Pahchay?"" Joe asked again. ""Never heard of it."" ""It's an old variety,"" Cain explained, ""first developed 73 years ago in Delaware."" Joe wanted to ask more, but had already started to feel slightly embarrassed about his suspicions. This was an apple stand, that's all. It was time to go home. ""Thanks,"" Joe said and turned to leave. The generator was blaring in his ear. Mr. Cain yelled out behind him after he got into the car. ""Pahchay's the Latin name you know. The locals call them Fred Kimballs."" Stunned, Joe turned to look at Cain. The stand was empty. Joe sped off from the stand, the bag of apples beside him on the seat. He rolled down his window and tossed the bag out. The car behind him swerved to avoid it, but ran over it anyway. When the driver honked loudly, Joe gave him the finger. On the way home, Joe's mind was revving faster than his car's engine. ""I can't believe this,"" he said to himself. ""There has got to be a rational explanation."" He was still thinking that when he turned out the lights for bed that evening. He had gotten home at 4:30. The ambulance arrived for Fred Kimball a little before six. That week, Joe looked for the apple stand every day on his way home from work. He was having trouble sleeping and, according to Karen, was also short-tempered and irritable. ""Joe, I don't know what's wrong with you these past few days,"" she said on Friday after dinner. Joe hated Fridays. The kids were usually out of the house, and Karen used the time to address family concerns. ""Nothing's wrong,"" Joe said curtly. ""Don't give me that,"" Karen said. ""You've been like a stranger this whole week, yelling at me, snapping at the kids."" ""Look, I said nothing's wrong, alright?"" Joe said. Karen threw her napkin on the table and stood up. ""I don't know why I even try,"" she said bitterly and walked out to the kitchen. ""I don't either,"" Joe called after her. ""Why don't you save it for your handyman?"" Karen came back into the room. Her eyes were angry. ""Is that what this is about?"" she said in her argument voice. ""I've told you before, Mark and I are just friends. He fixes the things around the house that you never seem to have time for anymore, and he does nice work. That's all."" ""Yeah, I know,"" Joe said sarcastically, ""that's all."" They stared at each other in silence. Finally, Karen spoke up. Her voice was calm and cold. ""I've had it Joe. I've really had it."" He looked up at her from his seat at the table. He knew she meant it. ""Either you get some help, or I'm leaving."" Joe yelled at her. ""Where are you going Karen, to him? Just go ahead!"" With that he pushed his chair back and stood up. Karen stepped to one side. He grabbed his car keys off of the hook and headed for the door. ""I'm going out,"" he said and slammed the door behind him. * * * The bartender looked at Joe from the other end of the bar and tapped his wristwatch. Joe looked at the clock over the bar. It was closing time, and Joe had been sitting there since nine. He fished through his wallet and threw a twenty dollar bill on the bar. He staggered slightly as he found his way to the door and out into the parking light. The night was cool and clear, and it felt good after the stale air of the bar. The plan had come to Joe during his third beer. It was perfect. It would be hard for Karen to run off with Mark Fisher if there was no Mark Fisher. What if he were plucked a little early from the tree of life? Joe smiled inwardly at his private joke. It was time to buy some apples. It took him two tries, but Joe finally got the car door open. The combination of the booze and his new plan made him feel strangely energized. He eased the car out of the parking lot and set out towards Route 24. After a while, he saw the glow of lights up ahead on the side of the road. He was in luck, Cain's was open. Joe parked clumsily and left his lights on. He got out of his car and shuffled over to the stand. The bright lights stung his eyes, and he could hear the ping ping sound of insects bouncing off of the aluminum shades. ""Cain!"" Joe called out loudly. ""Cain!"" Joe was swaying slightly. Cain appeared out of the shadows in the back of the stand. ""I'm here mister, no need to shout."" His eyes reflected the light strangely. ""What can I do for you?"" ""You know,"" Joe said with menace. ""You know. I want the apples."" Cain looked at him with a question on his face. ""What apples?"" ""Don't play stupid with me,"" Joe growled and grabbed the old man by the straps of his overalls. ""I want some Mark Fishers!"" Cain looked confused. ""Mark Fishers? I don't have any Mark Fishers"" ""The hell you don't,"" Joe yelled, and pushed the old man hard against the side of the shed. ""Listen,"" Joe said through clenched teeth. ""You sold me some apples you called Larry Millers. I ate them, and Larry Miller dies."" Cain was staring wide-eyed at Joe. ""Then I bought some Fred Kimballs. I threw them into traffic, and poof, Fred's pushing up daisies."" Joe paused to see if his words were having an effect. Cain looked frightened, but he was listening. ""And now I've got another problem, and you're going to help me solve it."" Joe tightened his hands on the old man's suspenders and slammed him against the wall again. ""Now, where are the Mark Fishers?"" Cain shook his head and was gasping for air. ""You don't understand,"" he said between breaths, ""you've got it all wrong."" ""How's that?"" Joe asked suspiciously. ""I said you've got it all wrong."" Cain had his wind back by now. ""I don't get to choose which apples to sell, I just pick the ones that are ripe. Larry Miller and Fred Kimball were ripe. Their time was up."" Joe stood there with his mouth open trying to digest what he had just heard. ""Let me get this straight,"" he said, letting go of Cain's suspenders. ""You don't choose the apples? Those two died of natural causes?"" Cain was nodding. ""Yep, in their cases anyway. The apples are just our way of timing things. We never sell them before they're ripe."" Joe stared at the tubs of apples around him. ""And all of these are,"" he swallowed hard, ""people?"" ""Oh my, good gracious no,"" Cain laughed heartily. ""We only get one or two ripe batches a day. The rest of these are for display purposes only."" He winked slyly. ""Well, what are you doing open now if you only get one or two batches a day?"" Joe asked with genuine interest. ""To tell you the truth, I was getting ready to close down when I saw you pull up,"" Cain answered. ""I just sold my last batch to a real nice fellow a couple of minutes before you got here. They were a young variety. Real pretty, fragrant too."" Joe's vision was blurry and he felt wobbly on his feet. He reached out for the wall to support himself. ""Funny thing about them, though,"" Cain continued. ""Every single one of them was rotten at the core."" Cain's blue eyes were fixed on the sagging figure in front of him. ""We call them Joe Johnsons,"" Cain said with a smile, and disappeared into the darkness. ",candidate00003
6,00002,unknown,"Nighttime is never a good time to jog in Quincy Park. It's dark and the paths are unlit. The main trail curves in towards the center of the park, far from the road. If a jogger twisted an ankle out there, it could be morning before help arrived. And there are other dangers. Maybe it was the full moon or the recent warm spell that made her want to get out of her apartment and enjoy a little fresh air and exercise. Maybe she just wanted some time to herself. Whatever her reason, it was a bad decision. I smelled her perfume before I saw her come around the bend in the trail. She was a graceful runner, slim and attractive. I watched her from a distance as she made a right turn down the trail by the creek, her ponytail bobbing behind her. She didn't see me. People rarely do. But they saw her. Three of them, half-drunk and unafraid. They called out something to her from the gloom by the side of the trail. She ignored it, but I could hear her pace quicken. Fear. A faint whiff was all, but I knew what it was. They would sense it too, and it was the only excuse they needed. The men were faster than I expected, lean and strong. The jogger glanced quickly over her shoulder, and took off at a full sprint. Instinct. Fight or flight. She ran down the trail, ducking branches and dodging the pot holes in the neglected pavement. She glanced back for an instant. The three men were still chasing her. She tried to run faster, but she was starting to tire. I could smell her body become hot and flushed, and her sweat became acrid. The gang was closer now, and closing in. The girl made a gasping noise, trying to scream but having no wind for it. She didn't look back, but she must have heard the tall one right behind her. He was almost on her now. The other two were not far behind. She began to slow down. I could hear the loose clop clop sound of her shoes hitting the pavement. The tall one reached out and grabbed her by the arm. She gasped out ""No!"" but he jerked hard and spun her around to face him. ""Hey hey, where are you off to?"" he said. He wasn't even out of breath. The jogger's reply was in her other hand. She brought it up quickly and let loose with a load of some spray in the guy's face. ""Ow, you bitch! You fucking bitch!"" He wasn't expecting that, and the kick in the crotch looked like a surprise also. She might have gotten away, except for the other two. By now they were on her, sizing her up, trying to decide how to take her. Finally, the bigger one just lunged at her. She tried the pepper spray again, but his momentum carried him through it and into her. They struggled for a moment as he tried to catch her arms and pin her to the ground. She bucked and twisted, trying to bounce him off of her. She stopped when she saw the knife. Number Two held the knife in his hand and waved it in the girl's face. The blade seemed to glow in the moonlight. ""Do you understand what this means?"" he asked the girl. She had started to cry. She looked up at the two of them and nodded. ""OK, you just do what we say, and you won't get hurt."" The big one slowly eased off her while Number Two kept the knife pressed to her face. ""Get up,"" he said. She stood up slowly. She looked wobbly from having been tackled and was sobbing softly. ""Where's Hector?"" the big one asked. ""I'm right here goddammit,"" Hector answered. He had red, swollen eyes and was breathing heavily. Mucus was dripping from his nose. ""Where's she at?"" he called out. ""Relax man,"" Number Two said. ""She's right here, she's not going anywhere."" Number Two and the big one were on either side of her, holding her arms. Hector walked over to her with some difficulty. ""You little bitch,"" he said. ""Just for that, I'm gonna make it hurt."" He slapped her, hard. ""Easy, easy,"" the big one said. ""We've got time."" The girl was hanging her head low, her sobs barely audible. Number Two seemed to be in charge. ""Let's go. Move her back into the woods, away from the trail."" He motioned to Hector to switch places with him. ""Don't let go this time,"" he said in a mocking tone. ""Man, fuck you!"" Hector answered. Number Two and the big one laughed. The girl resisted some as they led her off through an opening in the brush. Number Two rubbed the knife blade slowly across her breasts. She got the message. I moved forward slowly, staying low to the ground. They were headed towards the creek. The air was heavy and damp there, and sounds were muffled. They marched her to a small clearing near the bank. It was entirely shielded by sapling trees and tall grass. ""That's far enough,"" Number Two said. Hector looked up at the moon and then tried hard to peer through the trees. ""Man, this place is fucking perfect."" ""Put her on the ground,"" Number Two directed. She tried to kneel, but Hector and the big one pulled her down backwards, her arms held out wide. She was lying flat on her back now, looking up at Number Two as he stood next to her feet. Hector and the big one adjusted themselves, pinning her arms to the ground. Number Two crouched down, the knife in his hand. He waved it in her face. ""Do it man,"" Hector said. The big one let out a low laugh. Number Two raised the knife. I could see the blade in the bright moonlight. He slowly brought it down and moved his arm forward. I watched her body grow taught as the blade rasped on the fabric of her sports bra. ""Yeah,"" Hector said loudly. ""Do it!"" ""Man, shut up,"" Number Two said. ""Someone might hear you."" A twig snapped in the darkness. Number Two looked up and stared hard at the trees by the creek. He didn't see anything. He shook his head and looked back at the girl lying limply below him. He scooted backwards a little bit, and reached out one hand to her waist. He was still holding the knife up so she could see it. I couldn't control it any longer. The sound seemed to come from someplace deep inside of me. A low, almost quiet, growl. I felt my eyes narrow and the hair on my neck stand stiff and straight. ""Man, what the fuck is that?"" Number Two said with an irritated look around. ""Go check it out."" He motioned to Hector with the knife and pointed vaguely in my direction. Hector stood up, and Number Two took his place at the girls arm. The big one reached over and clamped his large hand over her mouth. Hector stumbled through the grass towards the edge of the woods. He was silhouetted by the moon and I watched him as he made his way across the clearing. He stopped and I could see him straining hard to look into the woods. I leaned against a small tree, and it rustled gently. ""Who's there?"" Hector called out in a loud whisper. Nothing. I reached out and clawed a fallen log. Hector heard it. ""Man, this ain't fucking funny! Who's there?"" He reached in his pocket and pulled something out. I heard the distinctive click of a switchblade locking in place. Hector moved closer. ""I'm not messing around with you. Who's there?"" I was crouched low, my muscles taut. I fought hard to control myself, to keep quiet. Hector looked hard at the brush, trying to make out my shape in the dark. I could smell it now. Fear. ""Man, this is bullshit,"" Hector said finally, and turned to walk back to the others. I leapt out. He was so close that I was on him before he could even turn around. I hit him low and hard, knocking his legs out from under him. He fell heavily on his back, dropping his knife somewhere in the grass. His face was wide eyed and his mouth was open. ""N-n-no! Get the fuck away from me,"" he yelled out as he tried to back away. I sprang and sank my fangs into his throat. He tried to push me off, but it was too late. I dragged him for a few feet closer to the woods, then shook my head violently from side to side. I felt his spine snap with a satisfying crunch and dropped him in the damp grass. I turned to face the others. They had heard the commotion and had stood up. They were coming my way, moving quickly across the clearing. The moon was high and full and I could see both of them, fanning out, coming fast to find me. I looked up and howled with excitement. I could still taste the kill in my mouth and the scent filled my nostrils. My brain was full of the red fog. The hunt was on. The big one saw me first. He had picked up a tree limb along the way and was holding it like a baseball bat. ""Jesus, look at the size of that sonofabitch,"" he said half to himself. I circled slowly, cautiously. ""Just keep him busy man, don't let him get behind you,"" Number Two said. ""I'm going to get a rock or something."" I was watching both of them. A low and menacing growl came from deep inside me. My ears were flat against my head, and my hair was erect. Number Two was slowly backing away, being careful to keep his eyes on me. ""Man fuck a rock, shoot him,"" the big one said. I could smell his fear. I crouched low, then charged. He swung the branch in a wide arc and it connected solidly against my left shoulder. Pain exploded along my arm as the momentum from his swing carried me off to one side. I turned around to face him, nursing my shoulder. The big one was pleased with himself. ""Well motherfucker, what do you think about that?"" he said with menace. I looked at him then glanced back at the clearing. Number Two was back with the girl now. He had forced her to her feet, was pushing her in front of him. ""I'm talking to you, motherfucker,"" the big one continued. I lifted my arm painfully. The movement made me wince. ""Not so bad now, are you motherfucker?"" He moved closer and I could smell his sweat and adrenaline. He started to bring back his bat. He looked like he was going to enjoy this. I looked directly in his eyes. Then I stood up. The big one froze, looking up at me. His mouth moved, but no noise came out. I snarled and slapped the branch from his hand. He tried to turn, but my claws had already found his soft belly. With a roar, I slashed down and across his torso. His guts spilled onto the ground in front of him. I left his crumpled body and ran after Number Two. He and the girl were making their way through the brush and back to the trail. I could hear his curses as the saplings snapped across his face. I fell back and entered into the woods. It was easier that way. I moved quickly and easily between the trees, savoring the moist earth beneath my feet and the breeze against my skin. They were still coming through the brush when I made it to the trail. I eased into the shadows and waited. He broke into the open about 25 yards from me. The girl wasn't with him. I watched him as he looked up and down the trail, trying to make up a plan. Not far from us, the trail met up with the bike path. If he got to the bike path, he had a chance to get to the road that circled the park. Sometimes the police patrolled there. He looked up and down the trail again, and took off for the bike path. I sniffed the ground for a moment, savoring the moist smell and the surge of the kill. I smelled him, faintly now. I trotted over to where he had come through the brush. Cautiously I smelled for the girl. It was a strong scent, and I picked it up easily. I made my way slowly through the brush, careful not to show myself. I paused, and could hear her gentle sobbing. She was crouched down by some bushes and was holding her arm across her body. She had been hit with something in the face, and I could smell the blood. Clouds had darkened the moon, and I approached to just outside her vision. ""Who's there?"" she cried out. She leaned back into the bush and grabbed for a rock or stick with her good arm. I watched her silently for a few moments. She was a survivor like me. I was turning to go when the moon pierced through the clouds, illuminating me in the silvery light. I looked at her face for just a moment. Horror. Fear. I vanished into the woods. Number Two was now quite a distance away. I picked up his scent at the trail. He was following the bike path, headed for the road. I set off after him, excitement causing me to yelp unexpectedly. I ran hard, the thrill of the chase pushing me forward. I smelled his fear before I saw him. I slowed and moved cautiously. I drew low to the ground, and approached him from the rear. He was too tired to run anymore and had his back against a tree. In the dark, I could hear his labored breathing and the raspy sound as he swallowed. The smell was of urine and sweat and metal. My eyes narrowed. Urine was good. He had pissed himself. Metal meant he had a gun. I growled. I heard the hammer cock back and jerked when the first shot went off. It missed wildly. He was shooting into the dark, trying to frighten me off. He probably still thought I was a mad dog. I listened for a moment for the sound of the hammer being pulled back. I could hear a siren in the distance. The girl must have found someone and called the police. I had time. The sound was still too distant for Number Two to even hear. Bam! Another shot. Still too high. I crawled lowly and slowly over to one side. The guy was panting and muttering to himself. It sounded like a prayer. My lips curled back, and I let out a low growl. He rustled against the tree, but couldn't tell where the sound came from. Bam! Missed. ""Who's out there?"" he called out. ""What do you want?"" I waited. The sirens were louder now. He heard them too. ""You hear that?"" he said. ""You hear that? The police are coming."" I heard it. The police were better shots than Number Two. I was running out of time. I looked to my left. There was an opening in the trees that I could get to, but I would have to run in front of Number Two to do it. Bam! Close this time. He must have seen my movement. Without pausing to think I sprinted across the trail for the opening. Bam! Bam! I felt the tingle starting in the small of my back. Damn! Number Two let out a triumphant yell. ""Got you, you sonofabitch,"" he shouted. ""I got you!"" I pushed as hard as I could for the safety of the forest. In the distance I could hear the voices of the police. I circled around behind Number Two. The police voices were closer now. ""Hey, over here,"" Number Two started to shout. ""Over here!"" I made my way to Number Two's tree. The pain had moved from my back into my stomach now. I stood up with some difficulty. My vision was starting to blur. I stumbled forward, just as Number Two looked around the tree behind him. He would have screamed, but I tore out his throat. The pain was intense now, and I began to feel nauseous. I turned away from the tree, and half-ran, half-stumbled into the woods. I could hear the police behind me. They had found Number Two. I pushed harder, deeper into the safety of the woods, but the pain was too much. I fell to the ground, and the world went black.

7,00003,unknown,"The Dashboard feature on Mom's Mac promised sunny skies and a high of eighty, but so far the clouds hung low, obscuring the sun the way the thick shades in the Sitting Room distorted the bulbs whenever Ally dared to play in there. ""That's the Sitting Room,"" her mom said last night when she found Ally playing on the couch with Trooley, Ally's doll. Mom was on her second martini. ""That's what I'm doing sitting,"" Ally said with a slight grin. She picked up Trooley, her favorite doll who was wearing a paisley dress these days, her black hair in braids, and marched her across the the couch cushion in military fashion. The couch used to be at Grandma's house and it still smelled like her, old and sweet with a faint trace of de- cay. Grandma hadn't survived the first outbreak. The couch had been cleansed, but the smell lingered. ""It's for guests,"" Mom said slowly, pronouncing each word carefully as if to intimidate. Really, though, Mom spoke that way (""deliberately,"" Dad called it) when she was drinking to avoid verbal stumbles and incoher- ent mumbling. Ally gathered her things Trooley, the fake tea set and went down- stairs to her playroom, which was actually the basement. Its cold, con- crete walls and brown, scratchy carpet didn't scream ""fun,"" but she made the most of it. Ally played mostly in the first corner Ally's Spot, she called it; she even used her stencil set to create a multi-colored poster ad- vertising just that, and Scotch-taped it to the wall. She also snuck down her Hello Kitty lamp, which helped fight the harsh glare of the two bare bulbs in the ceiling, their alien light always hurting her eyes and making her brain cramp. On rainy days, she'd stay down in Ally's Spot all day, except for going upstairs for her peanut butter and jelly sandwich at noon, which Mom would make slowly as if there existed greater meaning in the application of peanut butter and jelly on bread than simply lunch. The bottle of Beefeater Gin was never far out of Mom's reach, either. Mom never got up very early and today she was still asleep at ten. Ally had risen and eaten her Cheerios, sitting on Grandma's old couch, which could pass for something from a castle or a museum (she was def- initely not allowed to eat in the Sitting Room), and then placed the bowl and spoon in the dishwasher. There had been one Cheerio left in her bowl, just one, floating in the tan-colored milk. She wondered about that single Cheerio. Did it want to be eaten and join the others? Would it rather return to the box with the Cheerios waiting for their day in Ally's bowl? Or did the Fate of the Drain await this ""O""? Was it lonely? If she were a single Cheerio, alone in a dirty pool, Ally knew right where she'd want to be. So, Ally granted the Cheerio a reprieve from the Fate of the Drain. When her Mom discovered the Cheerio over three weeks later, she cried, finally forging a connection with a daughter she'd let disappear. Today would be the ideal day for lemonade. Mom had helped her squeeze fresh lemons last night after Ally finished playing in the base- ment and, taking advantage of Mom's suggestible state, managed to con- vince her that tomorrow would be the perfect day for a lemonade stand. It had been fun, too, squeezing the lemons onto a thing that looked like a fat, metal tooth. Fun until, of course, Mom passed out in the Family Room, drink on the table, a reality show flickering away on the TV. The lemon juice and the healthy portion of sugar she'd added before going to bed, waited for Ally in the fridge. She poured herself a glass and slowly sipped at it the way her Mom did all those drinks in the space- ship-looking glasses. The freezing sweetness numbed her lips and strangled her tongue. She gagged but managed to swallow. She brought the pitcher to the sink and added water. Then stopped. She emptied two 12oz bottles of water into the jug instead. The second taste proved more acceptable, but still very sweet. Hopefully the Mac weather forecast proved correct: if the day's temperature got real hot, people wouldn't care about the taste they'd just drink and be happy. But pay first, of course. Ally brought out one of the folding-tray tables from the Family Room. Sometimes she and Mom ate on them when Mom didn't want to sit at the kitchen table, only the two of them chewing on pork chops and gulp- ing their drinks milk for Ally, martini for Mom. Dad would be back, eventually, she said. He'd gotten sick like the people in California, like the people in Grandma's town. Mom said he was at a ""Special Medical Place"" in Virginia, but he'd come back. Everything would be alright. Dad was a doctor, the family type who always had plastic-wrapped lollipops in a bowl at the reception desk. He'd volunteered to help with the outbreak in California. Mom had told him not to go. ""It's not Swine or Avian,"" Mom said. ""This is deadly."" ""That's why I need to go."" Dad draped an arm over Mom's shoulders. She wiped at her eyes with her sleeve and shrugged his arm off. ""It's highly contagious."" ""It's a government program. They have precautions, procedures. I'll be fine."" ""Something could happen."" ""I need to help."" ""What about me? Ally?"" Dad paused then. He gently tugged a tear from her cheek. ""People are so afraid,"" he said. ""I need to do something to help."" Mom slipped into Dad's hug. ""Please, John."" ""Think of all the children in California. What if Ally were one of them? Wouldn't you want the best doctors to help?"" ""Yes,"" Mom said slowly. ""So why are you going?"" A moment later they were laughing. Ally thought that meant everything would be fine, but the next morning Dad kissed her and Mom goodbye and left in a black SUV, the words, Special Government Operation stenciled across the side like the letters in Ally's Spot. Now he was in Virginia. Had his face turned purple yet? Ally had made a similar stenciled sign on a piece of cardboard she found in the hallway closet the cardboard was really the bottom of a water-bottle package. Only bottled water now. If they ran out, Mom boiled water from the sink before it could be used. Ally had forgotten the bottled water at first, using unfiltered sink wa- ter in the lemonade. What if her customers get sick? Ally used duct tape to stick the sign to the corner of the folding tray. There were six roles of duct tape in the bottom drawer by the fridge. The plastic bags were in there, too. ""Just in case,"" Mom said every time she added another box of clear, plastic bags to her shopping cart. The air masks were in their own place under the sink among the bottles of ""Industrial Strength Disinfectant Perfect for Killing Germs and Clean- ing Bodily Fluids!"" On her second trek from the house to the edge of the lawn by the curb, Ally brought the jug of lemonade and a stack of 5oz Dixie bathroom cups, each decorated with a different clown face. She set the cups in three towers next to the jug on the tray. The ice-cubes clanking in the jug were made from bottled water. The third trip added her Little Mermaid money bank (Ariel on a rock, back arched, red hair flowing down toward her flipper) and, of course, Trooley. Ally assumed she was now ready for business, but then she took a fourth journey to get one of the kitchen chairs that had wheels on it. She pushed it over the grass to the tray table by the curb, near to their red-barn mailbox. She sat in the chair, placed Trooley on her lap so she could pet her braided hair, and waited for customers. Two hours later, the first dark clouds crept in from the west. Where California is, Ally thought. The sun was supposed to come out, break through the low clouds and make people so warm they'd get thirsty. In- stead, the temperature had dropped; Ally started massaging away the goosebumps on her arms. If it got any colder, she'd have to get her NYU sweatshirt. That was where she was going to go to college. She'd study medicine like Dad, maybe cure diseases, too. First, however, she had to get through the fourth grade and the evil Mrs. Haggartsnat, whom everyone called Old Hag Snot. She giggled. Would any kids dare call her that to her face? Maybe Bobby Max- well he was crazy enough. Mom came out around one. Ally had started to slip into the hazy illusionary world of daydreams, places where Trooley could speak and walk around without Ally's help, when Mom touched her shoulder. The streets, meaning only Maple St. and Pine Ave, were empty. Ally hadn't seen any cars or the usual Daily Walkers, not even Ms. Kegman and her little toy poodle Flopsy, who took afternoon excursions to ""make sure no malfeasance is about."" Their little corner of Pleasant Oaks Gated Community, a place that some of the kids at school, like Carlo, called a ""place for stuck-ups,"" was now like that Wild West theme park they went to last summer. They had walked down an old Main Street, only a few fake tumbleweeds populat- ing the dirt road. The curved doors on the Slugger's Saloon squeaked open and shut in smaller and smaller arcs, pushed from an invisible wind. Then a pistol crack echoed around them and the buildings spewed out actors dressed in Old West attire. In moments, they were in the middle of a staged shoot-out. Ally had started crying because of the loud noises, but she'd enjoyed the park especially later when eating an ice cream bar amid the soothing Old West piano music from a nearby loud- speaker. Mom, Dad, and ice cream. ""You should come in, dear,"" Mom said. Her eyes flitted around the two streets and all the identical homes, hand on Ally's shoulder. ""It's like Ghost Town,"" Ally said. ""Remember?"" Mom shook her head slowly. Her eyes still flipped from Maple to Pine and over each house, like mentally jumping hopscotch. ""It's going to rain."" ""But the Dashboard thingy said it'd be eighty and sunny."" ""Weather is fickle."" Ally didn't know what that meant, but she didn't say anything. Some- times Mom just didn't make sense it was a fact of life. ""Is it because of The Rots?"" Ally asked. Mom walked past her to the street, turned one way and then the other, then went to the driveway and picked up the rolled-up newspaper. It was wrapped in plastic. She unwrapped it, unrolled the rubber band, and unfurled the paper. She stared at the cover. Her face tensed and then relaxed, eyes widen- ing, and then it was like a cloud passed over her mind. Her face went slack, as if she fell asleep. Ally opened her mouth to say, ""Mom?,"" but stopped. Maybe it was better to leave her alone. Ally couldn't say why that was true, but it seemed right. More dark clouds had moved in like silent assassins to murder Ally's lemonade enterprise. They were bloated beasts fat with rain, preparing to vomit it all out. The sunshine that had been the dim light behind a heavy shade was now the distant glow of a nightlight smothered be- neath a comforter. A breeze tumbled one stack of Dixie cups into the other towers, and they all collapsed onto the tray table, ricocheted off the jug of lemonade, and fell to the grass, which had started to brown in random patches. Like the disease. Maybe the rain would be good. It would give life back to the grass. Wash away the decaying patches. Rain could heal. Rain was life. ""Ally,"" Mom said in a sharp clip. She had broken from her trance, her eyes poised and something else, too. What was that emotion fear? Pan- ic? Desperation? ""Time to pack up. Get inside."" ""But Mom "" ""I'm going to call your father."" After a pause, she added, ""And bring that chair inside; it doesn't belong out here. It belongs in the kitchen."" Mom was back up the driveway and inside the house before Ally could retry her retort. Going to call your father. But Dad was in Virginia and unreachable. Had Mom lied about that? Why? Yet another example of the Confusing World of Adults. Ally started to gather the Dixie cups Trooley watched from the chair with her black eyes when the approaching rumble of a car made her pause. This could be the one and only chance for a sale today. Hope still existed. An old station wagon with chipped tan paint and rust spots like the grass slowed to a stop at the curb, mere feet away. It was like the car appeared out of nowhere. A thin man sat in the driver's seat, hands on the wheel. A shadow ob- scured his face. Someone else, a child maybe around Ally's age, was in the back, asleep. There was something strange about the kid's posture, but Ally couldn't say what. The car door swung open with a squeak and the man stepped out on unsteady legs, as if he were walking on a boat out at sea. His clothes, a black wind jacket and a speckled shirt of brown and blue and faded jeans, hung off him, a size or two too large. He was starting to bald; what hair he did have floated off his head in thin, hay-like wisps. But it was the man's face that stopped Ally's words, the sentence she had had men- tally practiced all last night as to avoid sounding childish Would you like some lemonade? The man had deep-set eyes beneath a prominent brow and cheekbones that stuck out at harsh angles bookending a round nose over a thin mouth around which several-days worth of stubble had taken root. He was too thin, as if he had been dieting too much, but he could almost pass for Dad. Dad who had gotten ill and probably lost weight, too. Dad who said he'd be back. Ally almost called this man ""Dad,"" but stopped herself in time to pre- vent looking pathetic a little girl crying for her daddy. The man smiled at her the way Dad always did, the corners of his lips pushing up his cheeks to showcase his dimples, what Mom called, ""Angel Kisses."" His brown eyes warmed, though they appeared lost in two black holes. There was something wrong with this man, but Ally didn't think she was in danger. In another world, this man could be Dad. ""Thirsty,"" the man said in a strained voice. Creases in his lips re- minded Ally of the lines in Mom's clothes after she ironed. ""Lemonade?"" Ally asked. The man nodded. Behind him, in his car, the child still hadn't moved. The man pointed to the few Dixie cups that hadn't hit the grass. ""One dollar,"" Ally said. He raised an eyebrow just the way Dad did when he knew Ally was joking with him. ""Free taste?"" the man asked. Ally hadn't ventured into this business to give her product away, but maybe this was how it worked: hook 'em with a free sample and then get them to buy, buy, buy. She nodded and poured one cup full. She held it out to him. A skinny clown face in bright white with huge blue lips smiled back on the cup. The man smiled again and she wanted to ask if he knew her Dad. That was silly, of course. Just because he sort of resembled Dad didn't mean he knew him. The man took the cup from her hand gently, the clown face bloating slightly. His fingernails were cracked and bluish-black. The skin on his hands were faintly green. And what was that smell? Like the buried aroma in Grandma's couch, only much stronger. And much more vile. Ally would have held her nose, but that was rude and besides this man was nice. The man gulped all 5oz in a quick swallow. He sighed and placed the cup on the tray. His blackened forefinger nail was inside the cup as he set it down. From a pocket in his jeans, the man fished out a crumpled dollar. It rolled across the tray like those tumble weeds at the theme park. ""Please,"" he said. Should she give him a new cup? Wasn't that wasteful? She refilled his cup. A tiny bit spilled on the tray. She'd have to clean that up or Mom would give her some speech about taking care of your things when she discovered the sticky patch. The man brought the cup to his chapped lips and paused. There was something by his ear a fly or a speck of dirt. He lowered the cup. ""How much for the whole jug?"" Behind her, the front door opened with a clang. ""Ally? Come inside."" The man set the full cup on the tray table. He stared over Ally at the house. Maybe Mom would recognize the resemblance, too. ""Five dollars?"" the man offered. That would certainly make this uneventful day a highlight of her week. But the jug could fill dozens of cups, at least she assumed it could. ""Ten,"" she said. She picked up Trooley, hugged her close. She couldn't believe she'd said that. ""Ally?"" The desperation in Mom's voice cut through the rush of excite- ment. ""Ally, get away from that man. Now."" The man raised both hands as if to surrender, but Mom was on the move, tromping over the grass with quick, frantic steps. ""Ally. Now!"" ""No harm meant."" The man reached back into his pocket. ""Oh, Jesus,"" Mom said. What was wrong? Had Mom finally lost her mind, gone permanently off to the Crazy House, as she liked to say? ""I'm just thirsty and "" Mom grabbed Ally's arm, but before Mom could pull her away, Ally seized the Dixie cup the man had set down. She didn't know why, though it had to do with Dad. And that dirt spot, definitely not a fly, near the man's ear was really a purplish, brown boil filled with pus from the man's decomposing flesh. ""Get away from here!"" Mom screamed. The man was saying something but Ally didn't catch any of it. Mom was rambling about the air masks, the home decontamination bath mix- ture, the plastic bags, the duct tape, The Rots, oh, dear God, The Rots. The man held up a bill, waved it at Ally. He set it on the tray, and then he took the jug of lemonade and got back in his car. The man was gone by the time Ally wrestled free from Mom's grip and ran to the kitchen window. Gone the way Dad was gone. She hoped the man liked lemonade, hoped it helped his thirst at least until his throat disintegrated. Ally stared at the half-filled Dixie cup in her hand some had spilled on the way in. She thought of the man's eyes, of his smile, of his ""Angel Kisses,"" and she drank the lemonade. Mom was running up the stairs and now scavenging the bathroom for the decontamination bath mixture. It would sting, hurt Ally's eyes, but she'd have to endure it. The day's newspaper was on the kitchen table. Above a picture of screaming people with their faces sliding off like melting butter and frantic doctors in astronaut suits, the headline read: ROTS PANDEMIC SWEEPS NATION. Beneath that, it read: Thousands Expected to Die. And beneath that, Local Man with Rots Evades Authorities. Ally thought of the man's cracked, blue and black fingernail in the Dixie cup, of the man's withered and chapped lips on the cup's rim, of the motionless child in the car. She thought of these things and wondered if Dad was still alive. Two weeks later, Ally's mother attended her daughter's cremation. All funerals and wakes were prohibited by law now that the death toll had exceeded 100,000. A week after that, she found a single Cheerio beneath a pillow on the couch in the Sitting Room. She cried over that piece of cereal for two hours. Then she placed it in a Ziplock bag and made herself a Beefeater martini, extra-dry. ",candidate00001
8,00005,unknown,"Five minutes of passing time between classes wasn't much but some- times it felt like a lifetime. Tyler Williams was exchanging books at his locker and grabbing the bag lunch Dad had made for him when Paul flopped his back against the lockers next to him. ""When were you going to tell me?"" ""Tell you what?"" Tyler asked. Paul laughed in the mocking way that said he knew Tyler was being a dick. ""Didn't even tell your best friend."" He shook his head. ""I mean, I should have known first. I'm just so proud of you."" Paul pretended to wipe away tears. ""It's no big deal,"" Tyler said. ""It's just a date."" ""It's the day you finally grew some balls. Congrats, man. I knew it would happen."" He slapped Tyler on the back. ""Next thing you know you'll be updating your status to 'in a relationship.'"" ""It's just a date."" ""It's proof you're not a homo."" ""Real funny."" ""You mean, you are a homo?"" Before Tyler could stop him, Paul was shouting in singsong fashion at the passing kids, ""Tyler's a homo! Tyler's a homo!"" Someone yelled, ""Right on, faggot!"" and someone else said, ""You're the fag, you retard."" Most of the kids crammed into the hallway of Stone Creek High School offered a brief, contemptuous glance and continued on their way. ""Where you taking her?"" ""Movie and dinner."" ""Then what?"" ""Then what, what?"" ""You just going to ask if she'll wrap that snaggletooth around your cock or you got something more creative planned?"" ""I'll be fine."" ""Yeah. You wouldn't even have the date if not for me."" Two days ago, Paul had told him that Rebecca had said that Sasha thought he was kind of cute and that she would answer a call from him if he happened to find her number, which Rebecca passed to Paul in a note folded fifteen times, like some secret message from an underground cult. Paul ragged him for three hours until he said that if Tyler didn't man up for once in his life, he was bound to be a homosexual, if, that was, he wasn't one already. If Tyler didn't make the call, Paul said he'd spread the word that Tyler's mother had found gay porn on his laptop. That was all the motivation he needed. His fears of rejection, which kept him pacing frantically back and forth in his bedroom and which spurred him into a vicious tirade of self-critique, proved a waste of time. Sasha giggled and said yes. Now, he was mere hours from the date and unable to think of anything else. Mr. Gerard had called on him twice in math and both times Tyler had been thinking about how he was going to make that first move on Sasha. He had even started a list in the margin of his notebook of possible tactics. Bluntly asking if she'd suck his dick was not one of the possibilities. ""I owe you everything,"" Tyler said in grand, kowtowing style. ""Happy?"" He slammed his locker shut and started toward the cafeteria. Paul, who didn't have lunch until the following period, followed right along. ""What you owe me,"" Paul said, ""is a date with Delaney."" ""I'm about to eat. You want me to vomit?"" ""Your sister is hot. You have to admit it."" ""I can't even respond to that."" ""Yeah, because you know I'm right."" Up ahead, kids were shouting or grunting back and forth to each other like gorillas in the mountains. A group of girls in short skirts and high heels gossiped rapidly back and forth. Passing them, Tyler caught the words, ""such a bitch"" and ""whore better back off."" The sounds of talking and yelling echoed everywhere. To the left, a little freshman was on his knees in front of his locker trying to get the combination right for the hundredth time. Any moment now, the tears would start. Tyler thought of his little brother Brendan and felt sorry for this kid but it wasn't his job to help him. That's why there were teachers, although he didn't see any in the halls. ""Besides,"" Paul said. ""I think she likes me."" ""Don't you have history class?"" ""Mr. B. doesn't care if I'm late."" Two football players, dressed in their home jerseys even though the season had ended months ago, were play fighting up ahead outside a computer lab. The flowing traffic gave them a wide birth, which slowed Tyler's steps to a crawl. ""This place is fucked,"" Tyler said. ""Just like you're going to be tonight, right?"" Paul asked. ""Right."" ""C'mon, man. She said yes. She's a little weird or whatever, but she said yes."" Paul leaned close. ""A girl like that is aching for it. I'm sur- prised one of the jocks hasn't hit it yet. She's ready to fall off the vine. You only have to reach for it."" Tyler had been with girls before but never advanced past the bound- ary of the jeans. He didn't want to seem like some desperate pervert but Paul was right: Sasha was exactly the type of girl who went around secretly hoping some guy would just whip it out for her. Before the date, Tyler would be back on the Internet surfing for dating tips. Just undoing her bra strap posed its own challenge. He'd spent enough time staring at her breasts in English that they were burned into his brain. He often thought about going up to her in class and ripping open her shirt and launching his mouth at those breasts. A hot rush flushed through him. ""You just have to man up,"" Paul said. ""Then you can stick it in her."" ""Real classy."" ""Then put in the good word for me with Delaney so I can stick-"" ""Jesus, enough."" Paul paused. ""All you have to do is lay the foundation for me."" ""No."" Paul adopted one of his over-the-top, dramatic personas. ""I see how it is. I see how you do me. Fine. Whatever. But I hope Sasha pulls some weirdo shit on you and you wake up with your cock in a jar."" ""That's great. See ya."" ""Whateva, nigga. Peace."" He made some kind of gang gesture over his head, something he probably saw in a movie, and headed back the way they had walked. Paul was always good for a laugh but Tyler was too busy waging an internal battle between anxiety and lust to care what he wanted. Tyler had a genuine chance to get some serious action tonight so long as he didn't turn into a cowardly douche. In the cafeteria, Tyler sat with this kid Aaron Vandershant who was sometimes funny and often a dick. If he knew about Tyler's date with Sasha, Aaron would unload a barrage of vile-soaked insults at Tyler's choice of girl. Aaron had never been seen even talking to a girl one-on- one, so Tyler didn't much care what Aaron said. Besides, the kid could be quite amusing. ""I'm in Mrs. Pulk's class,"" Aaron says before Tyler even opens his brown bag. ""She's doing her usual lecture shit and the class is real quiet. Bunch of zombies in there, man, I tell you. Anyway, she's talking about some constellation or some shit and then she stops, like freezes, bends over like she's about to fall and grabs the desk in front of her-Kyle Prescott is sitting there like somebody strung or out or something-and she unloads this ass cheek-shaking fart that sounds like a damn grenade going off. I was so stunned I couldn't say anything. And then you know what she does? Mrs. Pulk straightens up, looks at us, and says, 'Bet you can't beat that.' I fucking lost it, man. Almost fell out of my seat."" ""She didn't say that."" ""Fuck yeah, she did. That bitch is crazy."" ""That is crazy."" Tyler actually thought it was kind of great that a teacher, especially an old one like Mrs. Pulk, could be so cool about farting. ""Kyle woke up, started choking, said, 'Damn, what's that stink?' And I yell out, ""Look out, she had tacos for lunch!' That did it-class erupted and Mrs. Pulk had to stand there and take it."" Delaney and her friends Shannon and Randi joined the table. Usually, the conversations never overlapped or intersected but Tyler didn't detest his sister the way a lot of boys detested theirs. He never ignored her or pretended they weren't related. She was a year younger, a bit of a nerd and like to dress up real girly though not trashy like most high school girls. She only owned one pair of high heels and those she wore for her band concerts. They had been really close when they were young, play- ing all the time, and though he mostly made fun of her now, it was al- ways out of brotherly devotion. She was a cool girl and he liked hanging with her, but that didn't mean he wanted Paul shoving his tongue down her throat. Or anything else, for that matter. ""What's up, bro? Dad make you his special PB&J?"" ""Haven't looked yet. Aaron was regaling me with a story of Mrs. Pulk, the amazing farting teacher."" Delaney frowned. ""I love Mrs. Pulk. She farted in class?"" Aaron found a break in his laughter to make an explosion gesture with his hands and shout, ""Kaboom!"" Delaney smiled. ""That's horrible. Stop laughing."" ""It was like D-Day!"" Aaron yelled. His face had darkened to deep red. After saying something to Shannon and Randi, Delaney turned back to Tyler and asked about his big date. ""Who told you?"" ""Everybody knows, big brother."" She shook her head. ""You sure can pick them."" Aaron quieted his screeches of laughter. ""Date? Who you banging, Tyler?"" ""I'm not banging any-"" ""Sasha Karras,"" Delaney said. Aaron's eyes went huge. ""That weirdo bitch? You're kidding me? Her mother's a witch or something."" ""She's not a witch."" Sasha's mother worked the Key Club Fright Fest every Halloween, al- ways dressed up in a black gown with heavy, black makeup. She read fortunes from a stack of tarot cards. Kids said she sacrificed stray cats to her evil witch god. ""Crazy bitch collected Sasha's period blood to use in her ceremonies."" ""Ew,"" Shannon said but she was smiling. ""You made that up."" Aaron shrugged. Even if he had made it up that didn't mean it wasn't true. Such was the world of high school logic. ""Don't do it,"" Aaron said. ""You'll be tainted."" Tyler turned to Delaney. ""Thanks, sis."" ""No problem, bro. Just don't embarrass the family. I have a reputation to maintain."" ""Yeah, right. Tough to keep that nerd persona untarnished."" Her face crumpled a bit but she fought it off. ""Just don't forget to wear a condom."" ""Yeah,"" Aaron said, all serious. ""You don't want to have a kid with that bitch."" ""Shut up,"" Tyler said. He finally opened his lunch and found a Hot Pocket in its plastic wrapper. How the hell was he going to microwave it? Thanks, Dad. Chloe wanted her damn pills. She could scream for them, shout at the top of her lungs until her throat cracked and her energy vanished. She could beg for them, cry for them, but Anthony wasn't going to give them to her. Dr. Carroll had prescribed them, so, sure, legally she could take them, but that didn't mean she should take them. ""Please!"" Her plea rolled down the hallway from the bedroom where she kept a constant vigil in bed. If she really wanted her little coma-inducing pills, she could get out of bed and get them herself. But she wouldn't, of course, not until her with- drawal became too painful to endure. But he wouldn't let it go that far. She would wear him down and he would obediently fetch whichever colored pill she wanted. ""I need them."" Her voice was an anger-tinged cry, the sound of an an- imal stuck in a trap. He wasn't doing anything, just standing in the kitchen, cleaning the counter, drinking some coffee, but he wanted to tell her to get the fuck out of the bed this instant, stop being so damn pathetic, take a shower, get some clean clothes on, go outside and stop bothering him. ""I deserve them,"" she yelled. Her voice rasped like it was on the verge of collapse. Dr. Carroll said the pills would take the edge off, but they had done a whole hell of a lot more than that-they had anesthetized her from life. Dr. Carroll was a good man, a good psychiatrist based on the recom- mendations of a few people from work, but he was awfully quick to pre- scribe drugs. Anthony hadn't wanted his son Brendan on any Ritalin or similar Help-You-Focus drug, but the proof was, as they say, in the pud- ding. Brendan's grades had improved. So, after that day last month when he discovered the pain so many other parents have suffered and yet still thought his own pain far worse, he turned to Dr. Carroll for help. He and Chloe attended sessions together but, ultimately, Chloe had got- ten the script she wanted and found the peace she sought. If you slept all the time, maybe the pain would stay away. Anthony suffered more pain in his dreams where he relived the tragic day over and over or, and this was sometimes worse, dreamt the baby was still alive and then awoke to discover the truth. But Chloe didn't suffer nightmares; her pills were a forcefield against them. Against everything else, too. ""Why don't you care about me?"" Her words gargled on her self-pity. Anthony sipped his coffee and squeezed the dish towel in his hand. If he punched her in the face, he could knock her out without pills and the towel might cushion the hit so he wouldn't break her cheekbone. That thought lingered for several seconds before Anthony's revulsion pushed it far away, forced him to set down his coffee, and urged his legs down the hallway to the bedroom. The room was dark, the shades drawn. The day's sunlight was forced into the corners where swirls of dust danced in the air. The room stank of old sweat and persistent halitosis. Both were side effects of the pills. Chloe was beneath the comforter. Her withered body was hardly a lump among the folds. In the dark, her face was a talking shadow, like something from one of his nightmares. ""I've been calling for you."" ""I know."" ""Get me my pills."" He stopped halfway to the master bath. ""You should get out of bed."" ""I'm tired."" ""A shower will make you feel good."" ""My pills."" ""I'll make you some breakfast. The kids are at school. We can talk."" She paused, thinking. Her lips made a wet smacking sound. ""Talk about what?"" ""About helping you."" ""Helping me? Helping me? How the hell are you going to help me?"" ""I want you to get better."" ""Then get me my pills."" ""You sound like a monster. Like some dying witch."" ""Fuck you,"" she said in a casual way. He went into the bathroom, opened the medicine cabinet. The bottles stared back. ""That's what you want, isn't it?"" she asked. ""You just want to fuck me. Well, go ahead. Give me my pills and fuck me all you want."" Chills rolled over his skin. He kept his tone steady, loving. ""I just want you to get better. I want you to get back to life."" ""What about the life that was taken out of me and then from me?"" She was on the cusp of tears, as she had been the past month. ""You have to find a way to carry on. We still have three beautiful chil- dren. We have to do what is best for them."" ""You just want me to forget!"" she screamed. ""Forget about my baby? Forget like you forgot. You don't give a flying fuck about our dead child but I'm not that goddamn heartless! I need to grieve! I need my pills!"" Anthony's fingers tightened around a large white bottle. ""You hear me!"" she yelled again. ""Or don't you give a shit?"" He turned out of the bathroom, threw the bottle of pills at her head-she caught them with an exasperated ooofff sound, and left the bedroom. He slammed the door for good measure. What the hell was he going to do? He had to keep his family together. He had to find a way to bring back the old days, the happy days, the days before the baby died. He went back to the kitchen but his coffee had turned cold. Brendan's teacher wanted to speak with him. While the playground monitor escorted the rest of the class outside in a single-file line, Brendan approached Miss Tuyol. She was a young teacher, the youngest in the building, and some of the boys thought she was hot but Brendan didn't think of her as being hot or not. Actually, he never really thought about any of his teachers. She was sitting behind her desk, which was organized with colored folders and boxes and decorated with fake apples and little plaques that said things like ""World's Greatest Teacher"" and ""Teachers Light the Way to Tomorrow."" She was wearing a bright purple sweater with a picture of the Easter Bunny on it. ""Hello Brendan,"" she said. ""Hi."" ""How do you feel today?"" ""Good."" ""Any trouble focusing today?"" ""No."" ""You seemed a little lost when we were reviewing the states."" ""Sorry."" He had been more than simply lost. He'd been off in another world completely. The pills were supposed to help with that. The pills did help him focus but not always on what he was supposed to be doing. Dr. Carroll had put Brendan on the pill, what Brendan called his Pillie Billy, in October after a horrible progress report and a teacher-parent conference in which Miss Tuyol made it sound like Brendan had some really serious problems, aside from poor factoring in math and weak memorization skills in history. Next year he'd be in seventh grade, so if he didn't get his act together (whatever that meant), he'd end up in a far worse situation than he was in now. On the up side, Miss Tuyol compli- mented Brendan's creativity and language skills. She said he was a very creative boy. The only reason he had done well in English was because he enjoyed reading and writing stories. He wrote his stories, mostly short things with lots of violence, in a black and white composition book. He wrote the stories during recess or at home in his room. He had left the book at home today but that was okay because he had a different one with him, a really special one. ""No headaches?"" Miss Toyul asked. He shook his head. He hadn't told anyone that even before the end of the summer, his head had started to hurt every time he spent longer than a few minutes reading and he'd find himself inexplicably pulled away from the page by an annoying fly or the tree blowing outside his window or even random thoughts in his own mind. Pillie Billy had cured that, sort of. Every once in a while his head hurt but it wasn't always unpleasant. ""Your story,"" she said and picked up the two-page short story he had typed on Dad's computer. ""Do you have a goldfish?"" ""No,"" he said. The story was entitled ""The Dead Goldfish."" It was a bout this kid who thought his goldfish was possessed by a demon and he kills the fish by crushing it beneath his bare feet. Brendan described, as best he could, the jelly insides of the fish filling the gaps between the boy's toes. He compared it to snot. ""You didn't kill your pet fish, did you?"" Miss Tuyol asked. ""We had a dog once but it got old and couldn't walk so we had to put it down."" Miss Tuyol looked like she had something really serious to say. ""You've never hurt any animals before, have you?"" He thought of how much fun it was to pull Lizzy's tail. Lizzy was Delaney's cat. The cat didn't like it but pulling its tail didn't really hurt it, not much anyway. Besides, he liked Lizzy and didn't want to see her suffer. ""Your story is very descriptive."" ""Thanks."" ""Gory."" ""Thanks."" ""That's not always a good thing."" ""It's not?"" ""Next time, why don't you try writing about something more pleasant?"" ""Okay."" Brendan stared at his sneakers. ""What book do you have today?"" she asked. Brendan held up the large, hard-bound book. It was titled Finding God: A History of Appeasing Higher Powers and Fulfilling Man's Destiny. It was over three hundred pages with very few pictures and more than twenty chapters. Dad would have called it ""heavy reading,"" but Brendan never showed his dad, keeping the book hidden under his bed. Dr. Carroll had given it to him, said the book was just for Brendan, something to help him focus better and tap into his natural talents, whatever they might be. Brendan didn't understand what Dr. Carroll meant, but he didn't ask questions either. The doc wanted to help, he gave Brendan a book, so Brendan took it, read some of it, and kept it a secret. He was very good at keeping secrets. He had it with him today, however, because he had big plans for tomorrow. ""That looks interesting,"" Miss Tuyol said as if he were showing her that dead goldfish. ""It's just some boring history stuff,"" he said with a shrug. Miss Tuyol smiled. ""Okay. Get your coat and I'll bring you outside."" On the playground, Brendan sat in a swing and opened the book. He turned to Chapter Two. It was entitled ""Animal and Human: Sacrifices to Win Divine Favor."" While kids ran screaming all around him, Brendan read very carefully, as if trying to memorize every word. ""It is difficult to accept death in this society because it is unfamiliar. In spite of the fact that it happens all the time, we never see it."" - Elisabeth Kubler-Ross When Sasha returned from the bathroom, Tyler wondered for the hun- dredth time what her breasts would look like once he got her shirt off. Her T-shirt hugged her breasts-young, healthy, and firm-just enough, yet the shirt was not so tight as to remove all mystery. Tyler had spent enough time admiring those breasts in quick glances at school and more than enough time tonight peeking glances at them while he ate his cheeseburger and she picked at a salad. He had spent even more than enough time in bed at night thinking of those breasts-these breasts right in front of him across the table-and how they would feel in his hands or taste in his mouth. Imagining was one thing, but to actually touch them skin-to-skin would be like opening a Christmas present and discovering it was exactly what he wanted. And only one thing could be better, but he knew not to let his fantasies get out of reach. There was little chance he'd get past the threshold of her jeans and into her panties where the real thing that girls had and boys wanted dwelled like a treasure waiting to be excavated. The thing he had been waiting all of his seventeen years to unearth. ""Well?"" She had asked him something and he couldn't think of what it was. Shit. She was assessing him, evaluating if he was good make-out materi- al and missing her questions would not bode well for him when she made the final determination. He had been admiring those breasts again, of course. He knew only the vaguest details of the private lives of girls, but he had Googled bra sizes and determined that Sasha was in the C-range. Each breast was probably a handful once unleashed from the confines of the shirt and bra. But, of course, that brought up the tricky situation of bra straps and undoing them. He had Googled that, too, and found a site that instructed in step-by-step format how to unhook a bra strap-and with only one hand. ""You seem weird,"" she said. Her half-eaten chicken Caesar salad sat before her, oh, so ever close to those breasts. He fumbled a response that could have passed for the mumblings of a retarded person. She smiled at him, one jagged tooth protruding over the others in the upper corner of her mouth, her black hair hanging straight behind her like a curtain. At school she wore her hair up like all the other girls. Different hair presentation meant something, at least ac- cording to websites Tyler had read. It could mean the girl thought he was special enough to do something different; it could mean the girl was hoping for a special evening; or it could mean jack special shit. ""Sorry,"" he said. ""For ... ?"" Retarded mumblings again. Every time he tried to respond, his eyes ventured down to those breasts and an alarm went off in his brain: LOOK AT HER FACE, AT HER FACE! But that shouting com- mand only fumbled up his words even more. ""How's your cheeseburger?"" she asked. ""Good,"" he said without the slightest mumble. She glanced around; her smile faded. Cheerful Charlie's Diner was fairly well-packed with the late-evening crowd. The diner was a 1950s throwback with plush red seats and booths, vintage signs (a Coca Cola advertisement featuring a green-haired elf-type person with huge, hungry eyes and a Coke bottle top for a hat always gave Tyler the creeps every time he ate here), and a giant juke-box that didn't play music but lit up and flashed sometimes like a strobe light. The oldies music came from ceiling speakers. Tyler didn't know any of the songs and, it seemed, neither did Sasha. There was no diner in Stone Creek, but Charlie's was only a few miles out on Route 51. The place was open 24 hours and Charlie, the Charlie of the restaurant's name, was a round-bellied guy who often played Santa at the Newburgh Mall in December, and who didn't harass teenagers the way the staff and owners at many restaurants did, especially after dark. This place was a typical stop for kids from school. Tyler thought he recognized some kids in the back, but they were too busy shooting spit- balls at each other to offer Tyler a frontal view. Tyler had known that other kids might be here, of course, and had weighed the potential awk- wardness of some kids mocking him with the comfort Sasha might feel at going to a familiar place. He hadn't read that advice on any website; he had reasoned that one out himself. The websites had suggested fancy dining; fine dining, they called it. Fine dinning, they asserted, was the easiest way to get a woman's clothes off. Aside from getting her drunk or drugging her, of course. So,"" she said when her gaze returned to the table. ""That movie kind of sucked."" Tyler had taken her to a movie first in hopes that he could build his courage during the flick and then really put on the moves over dinner. The movie was a stupid horror flick about a girl trapped in a basement with a monster that resembled a toad. Tyler enjoyed when the girl stripped to her underwear before getting inside a sleeping bag with her equally hot, and equally near-naked, friend: did girls really do stuff like that? Sasha watched the movie with her body leaned away from him for most of the film, and didn't want any popcorn, which left Tyler eating an entire bucket. The butter he had plopped on top of the popcorn had tasted so good but now, as it mingled with the ground beef from his bur- ger, he felt the weight of it like a brick sinking into his bowels. When the toad-thing leaped out of the basement's darkest corner with its huge mouth full of teeth and its scream echoing in the theater like an explosion, Sasha jumped in her seat and grabbed his arm. When the monster bit off the girl's foot (gallons of blood squirting all over the girl and the monster), Sasha screamed and squeezed his arm, a genuine squeeze. Tyler smiled and stole another glance at those breasts. ""Yeah,"" he said. What could he say? You ever strip to your underwear and climb into a sleeping bag with another girl? Sasha's cellphone was out and she was texting. She yawned. Though her salad was mostly uneaten, Sasha was obviously done with dinner and if he didn't say something clever or somehow get her interested in him again this date was over. She snapped her phone shut and stared straight at him as if she hadn't noticed him before. Her breasts-LOOK AT HER FACE!-jiggled when she placed her elbows on the table on either side of her salad and rested her chin on her folded hands. This pushed her breasts together and made them even larger. ""I don't have to be home for an hour,"" she said. ""Oh."" She smiled and her snaggletooth incisor seemed larger than before. Someone who has such a physical imperfection, even a slight one, is good at concealing it. Paul hid his braces for three years in middle school by never fully smiling at anyone. Tyler had been one of the only people who knew for sure that Paul had braces. That meant Sasha was smiling larger now, which was good. Or it meant her tooth was growing. The waitress, dressed in a blue apron with a cartoon fat man over her chest, one pudgy thumb up, asked if she could take their plates and they both nodded. Plates in hand, the waitress inquired about dessert. Sasha asked for the check. She turned back to Tyler. ""I'm glad you asked me out."" ""Me too,"" he said. ""You're a sweet guy."" A sweet guy who has masturbated to thoughts of you for almost nine months, he thought and immediately scolded himself for being so perverted. If she sensed his longing, his desperation, she'd end the date right now. The websites stressed that women wanted ""action"" as much as men did, but women were always turned off by desperation. If a guy wants a woman too badly, the woman will often turn him down. Women want to know there's interest, but they also want a challenge. A website also recommended jerking off before the date to help calm anxiety. Tyler found his favorite porn site and started but his father kept walking back and forth outside his room so he stopped. If Sasha went down on him, if that was even a possibility, it wouldn't take long to finish. ""There's a place near my house where we can hang for a bit, if you want. Then you can drop me off."" Tyler nodded because he couldn't swallow the lump in his throat to speak. He paid the bill, left five bucks on the table, and let Sasha give him directions to their next stop. Sasha lived in a mobile home that had been converted into a somewhat normal-looking two-story house with a concrete front porch and an extension off the back, which served as a game room and her mother's bedroom. Two large perfectly pruned bushes stood guard on either side of the porch. A light was on upstairs and another, a red one, flickered in a downstairs window, probably from a TV. ""Nice,"" Tyler said and hoped he didn't sound surprised or sarcastic. ""Nice bushes, right?"" ""What do you mean?"" ""Never mind."" The house was one among hundreds in the Hidden Hills community, a name contradicting the numerous hills and valleys that comprised the individual properties of the mobile homes. The kids at school called this place Trailer Trash Town, the homes Trashy Trailers. Even the students who lived here, and there were more Tyler suspected than those who admitted it, used the term. Better to acknowledge the shitty choices your parents made than to delude yourself into thinking you were normal. ""Keep going,"" Sasha said. ""I don't want my mother to see us."" They drove down a steep slope that curved to the right so suddenly that Tyler almost crashed into a pickup truck parked in the road. He narrowly missed an oncoming jeep and then rode his brakes the rest of the way down the hill, which reminded him of water swirling down a funnel. The mobile homes (trashy trailers) were set at odd angles to one another and ensconced into hillsides like pieces of litter in clumps of mud. Some of them hadn't seen a moment of handyman attention in decades while others could have passed for pleasing, though small, addi- tions to the community his parents had chosen: Sky View Estates. It was a gated community where Mexicans cleaned the streets weekly and re- painted the homes every other year. Sasha directed Tyler to a small, empty gravel parking lot overlooking a lake. A sagging, rusted fence boarded two sides of the lot. Tyler pulled to the edge, facing the lake. On the other side of the dark water, the lights of more mobile homes glowed like tiny eyes on the hulking humps of hills. Those hills comprised a giant beast, a malicious creature forever guarding the still waters of a man-made lake-like in that Lovecraft story Mr. Stein had read to them. Tyler wished he could coverhis windshield. ""Beautiful,"" Sasha said. She undid her seatbelt. Was that an invitation to make a move? ""Sure,"" Tyler said after a moment. He turned to her, barely aware that he was making a move; something inside him had seized the controls and wasn't going to let him delay any longer. ""But not as beautiful as you."" She smiled for a moment and then burst out laughing. Tyler turned back to the hundred-eyed monster. What did its laughter sound like? ""I'm sorry,"" Sasha said through dwindling chuckles. ""You don't have to try so hard. I'm the one who brought us here, after all."" ""Sorry,"" he said, though unsure why. ""What about some music?"" she asked. Tyler turned the car battery on and the receiver started with the last song that had been playing on his iPod: ""Stay Don't Go"" by Spoon. She hadn't made any comments about his music during the drive and she didn't now. Did she hate it? Did it matter? ""So?"" she asked. ""So?"" She smiled again and moved toward him as if gliding like a ghost. Without barely any time for his brain to register what was happening, Tyler moved toward her, closed his eyes, and met her lips halfway across the car. The kiss lasted only a few seconds but it was long enough for Tyler to taste the Caesar dressing from her salad. She broke the kiss and sat back in her seat. Tyler stayed for a moment in a slant, his seatbelt stretching across his chest. ""Why do you like me?"" she asked. Tyler sat back, unfastened his belt. Though a smile still lingered on her lips, Sasha had turned more introspective all of a sudden as if the kiss had pried something lose in her mind. How was he supposed to an- swer this question? What did she want to hear? The song changed to ""Paper Tiger."" Tyler said, ""What do you mean?"" ""It's not a hard question."" ""You're ... really cool and pretty and ... I don't know."" ""It's just that you've barely ever said anything to me. Did you think I'd be easy or something?"" In the faint glow from the radio receiver, Sasha's eyes glimmered green and small shadows accentuated her pointy nose and the curve of her upper lip hiding that snaggletooth. Her pale skin absorbed the light and gave her a faint seasick aura. ""I just ... like you."" ""You've been with many girls?"" Tyler shook his head. Her breasts were ready to break through her shirt. His hand twitched. Just a touch, a caress, a suck. ""I know what people say about me,"" she said. ""About my mother."" ""I haven't heard."" He thought of Aaron's period-blood rumor. Tyler had only had one girlfriend prior, and that had been three years ago at science camp. He had experienced his first French kiss but noth- ing else. He didn't think he was unattractive or weird or anything. He just never handled himself around girls the way he wanted. Paul had known this is what he needed. Tyler knew it, too. And now she was getting all serious. ""I don't care what people say,"" she said. ""I don't. People are assholes."" ""They are,"" he said. The song changed to ""Back to the Life,"" opening with a maniacal laugh. Her eyes went to the receiver, on which the song title was spelled out, and Tyler's eyes went to her breasts. The heavy beat of the song unleashed something inside him, something like instinct, and he moved in for the kill. Their lips met again, softly at first and then he pressed harder and his tongue found its way into her mouth where it slipped over and around her tongue like two slugs mating. Her snaggletooth pressed against his teeth like a popcorn kernel, but the discomfort only spurred him on. His hands groped at her back, found the edge of her shirt and pulled it up all the way to her chin. Then his hands were on her breasts, caressing them, squeezing them. Something red and hot burned inside him and grew hotter and hotter. He went for her bra strap with both hands, just to be sure, and unclasped it almost immediately. The excitement at this ac- complishment pushed his tongue more forcefully against hers and he lif- ted her and shifted so that her head lay against the door and her legs tangled with his around the shifter. He tore her bra off and finally broke the kiss. She gasped for air as if she had been under water. Her breasts were even larger than he had hoped. He grabbed one and began sucking forcefully on the other. Still, the red hotness burned, throbbed, screamed inside him. This is what he had wanted for so long, so fucking long, oh how fucking wonderful. Her hands grabbed at his hair and tugged playfully. He shook them off and sucked even harder on her breast until her moan morphed into a cry of pain. He pulled off of her breast, tugging at her nipple, and stared at her for a moment. The shadows had shifted on her face and now made her appear younger, smaller. She started to speak, and Tyler suffocated her words with his mouth. Women love being dominated, a website declared. His hands found the edge of her jeans and tore open the fly. The hot redness burned hotter and hotter and hotter, screaming for him to keep going. This was going to be wonderful, so fucking wonderful. He slipped one hand behind her and shifted his weight to that arm while his other hand jumped onto her crotch. Her panties stuck to her groin in a patch of moisture: she wanted this just as much as he. This was too wonderful to believe. He found the seat lever and yanked it almost hard enough to snap it while he picked her up again and flopped her down on the seat, forcing it backwards, nearly flat. The part of him that would have stalled the engine of his passion had fallen off somewhere and now stood back, shocked and delighted. Another deep-probing kiss later, Tyler pulled off her jeans and let his fingers explore her most sensitive of areas. She moaned and repeated his name again and again but he barely heard that over the monstrous pounding of the screaming red inside him. It could have been an alarm shouting FIRE! FIRE! but it only pushed him farther. He undid his own fly and pushed his pants and boxers past his knees and wriggled them to his ankles. Her moans grew louder and her hands grabbed more roughly at his hair and arms. He drove his tongue against hers once more, her snaggletooth crushing his gums, and then he went for everything in one quick gesture-he pulled her panties to the side and slipped the head of his penis into her where her muscles stopped it and her fingers clawed more desperately at him and then he shoved all of himself into her as he released a powerful grunt of pleasure. The hot redness hollered louder and louder still until his entire body burned with the screaming lust. And when he released that hot redness inside her, Tyler finally noticed the tears on her cheeks, green in the light, and heard her begging, ""No, stop, no, stop, Tyler, stop, stopstopstoppleasestop!"" He slumped back into the driver's seat without bringing up his pants. Sasha curled into a fetal position on the passenger seat and sobbed. Across the lake, a giant monster watched it all through a hundred glow- ing eyes. ",candidate00001
9,00008,unknown,"I have no memory of what woke me, save for the fact I know it was no sound or motion. A fragment of dream billowed across my fragile mind, and as so often happens on the edge of waking, I clung to it like a drowning man to a raft. I fought to gain some sense of the images behind my tired eyes, but I could hold on no longer. I fell awake. The room was dark, and although the clock by my bedside showed midnight approaching, I had the strangest sensation of time having slowed or even stopped. From my bed, I could see out of the window and across the rooftops that made up my city, for I never drew my curtains during summer months. Clouds hung still in the air, smoke rising from chimneys seemed frozen, and yet I told myself that this was normal. There was no wind, the air was as still as a frozen river, and I could expect to see no movement from where I lay. Bravely, I told myself this. The feeling hung about me however, like a shroud, that all was not as it should have been. The curtains, bunched at the frames of the windows, twitched as if a small bird had flown into them. My throat grew strangely dry as I watched them settle. An odour pervaded the room then (or had it been present all along? Indeed, was it this that had woken me?), like the sweet summer smell of an apple orchard, corrupted by time and rot and despair. I slept with the windows open, but knew of no orchard nearby that could have perfumed the air. I breathed deep of it, as if to better judge my situation, and immediately my head swam as if drugged. I became aware of a red cloudiness fogging my sight, and indeed my hearing, that became so pervasive and cloying that I believed I knew how it was to drown. I struggled and clutched uselessly at the bedclothes, pooled around me in damp twists, and tried to shout. Whether I was shouting for help, for courage or from a sense of dread I had no idea. The point became irrelevant, as what escaped my throat was nothing more than a ragged whine. That whine dried up and I gasped aloud at the sight of the figure at the foot of my bed. Where he had come from I had no idea, nor did I recognise the sloping stance, or stick thin limbs. He reminded me nothing so much as a tree in full winter starkness. That the pervading odour came from him I had no doubt, for no sooner than I thought of it, I was hit anew by the stench, no longer reminding me of sweet summer apple, but rather now an abattoir smell filled my lungs, all meat and sweet raw blood and fear. He gazed at me with eyes I could not see; such was the gloom that hung around him. I felt watched however, the way a rabbit must feel before the ravening jaws of a wolf, and I admit that I let out an in voluntary murmur that was more a result of instinctive terror than of anything else. As my eyes became used to the way darkness clung to him, I made out the shape of his head, the severe but beautiful slope of his forehead, the sharpness of his nose. His mouth swam into view, more a cursory nod to that feature than an organ of speech, of emotion. A small dark tongue flicked out to wet the thin lips, and left there a trail of thick glistening saliva. It looked black in the darkness. I pushed with my feet, and felt the headboard of my bed scraping down past my neck, then my shoulders, resting under my shoulder blades. The sound was like nails across sandpaper, for my senses seemed to have exponentially heightened with the figure's presence. My arms hung limp by my sides and I felt nothing below my chest. If I could have cared about such things, I would have checked beneath the bedclothes for my legs, even felt for their lumping shapes on the bed. I didn't care about such things. I felt I had kept my silence for long enough, for the figure seemed as a statue. Apart from the searching tongue, he hadn't moved. Who are you? It seemed I only mouthed the words, for no sound broke the stillness of the room. I knew I had not spoken, and yet the man (for that is how I had to think of him) cocked his head and smiled. It was quite the most fearful sight I had ever seen. Sparkling white teeth broke the gloom of his face and his lips peeled back into almost paper thinness. There seemed an abnormal expanse of dark red gum above the teeth, and it seemed alive, as though worms or maggots squirmed and writhed beneath the surface, the flesh rising and falling in impossibly small peaks as if something were trying to break free. It gave the teeth a false impression of length, because the lips rode so high on the gums. They were sharp too, narrowing to needlepoints it seemed, and although he was still the full length of the bed away, I saw how the very tips of the teeth were translucent, like fine bone china. The air seemed to reverberate around him, and the blackness that had at first seemed to pervade the whole room but had then resolved around the figure alone, swirled and eddied like ink in a bathtub. The smile left his face. There was no transition from one state to the other. There was at once the pained, wretched, writhing grin, and then the face was as serene as a sleeping baby. I must have gasped because the head lifted and his eyes met mine fully for the first time, their bloodshot and somehow lifeless gaze corrupting me, staining me with redness. I pushed myself further up the bed, my bare shoulders chilled on the wall above, my spine knocking painfully against the headboard. Abruptly, a wash of calm enveloped me, although I wasn't yet sufficiently under its spell to realise that it was just that. This creature, this man, was hypnotising me with his glare. I fought as bravely as I could against the feeling, peripherally aware of brazen, bloody images flitting in my mind, as if I was looking at a series of photographs and forgetting them almost instantly. I felt chilled by their content, red torn flesh, and ruptured viscera. I felt pain in the images, violation and ultimately loss, and yet I cannot place one single image firmly enough in my memory to describe it in any detail. Was he planting these images in my mind? Was he preparing me for some as yet unimaginable onslaught of experience? In the fraction of a second it took for this to pass through my mind, I knew. These were his memories. This was him. My life felt, if it hadn't all through this encounter, on the edge of existence. I knew I had minutes left. This creature was not of this world, and nor would I be. Strangely, all worry dropped from my shoulders, and I found myself spending what I knew would be my last minutes, trying to understand the images, to make some sense of them so that I might recall these experiences in whatever passed for the afterlife. Perhaps I fell asleep then, for the speed at which he approached my bed was like time-lapse photography, like the first and last picture in a child's flip-book. I felt the feather-light touch of a breeze on my chilled skin, blinked my eyes against the motion of air, and yet he showed no signs of having moved. His hair was still, his clothes the same. His eyes stared down at me from their roost, like two black ravens set deep into the white alabaster of a castle wall. He moved his head then, cocked it to one side, and I had the strangest feeling that he was exhibiting great control over his movement, as if he could, and should, have moved so much faster. All this lent weight to my notion of him being inhuman, un-human. He spoke suddenly. I say suddenly because I saw nothing of movement in his lips. Only his eyes sparkled, and I heard his words deep in my brain, like the hint of memory. Are you scared? How did I answer this creature? Did he expect my answer? Surely he could sense my fear in the smell of my body, like sour sweat oozing from my very soul. Surely he could sense my fear in the set of my body, rigid, ready for flight. Surely the loud thump I recognised as my heartbeat answered his question as convincingly as I could ever have done with mere words. 'Yes.' He smiled. It was a toothless smile, as if his lips were glued together, and it gave his look that of sympathy, of inevitability. I swallowed and heard the click in my throat as if it was a snapping twig. He reached a hand to me, fingers open, palm upwards, as if he were inviting me to take his hand in mine. Suddenly his fingers clenched in to a fist and as if he had reached inside of me, my heart seemed to slow, and then stop. My breath caught in my throat and I stared at him, wide eyes. Then he released his fist, and released my heart and breath and I gasped air like a floundered fish. He laughed a low, easy laugh. 'Come,' he said. He turned from my bed and I squeezed my eyes shut against the vision of him outlined against the window. I heard the swing of the window as it opened, felt the light, warm breeze of the night. When I opened my eyes, he was gone. 'Come,' I heard again, as if the creature was still in my room. Without thinking I swung my legs over the edge of the bed, and hurriedly dressed in crumpled clothes that I had thrown off the previous night. I walked to the window and looked out on the glorious night. It was one of those nights seldom experienced in England. Warm, clear, and smelling faintly of fresh cut grass and lovers' perfume. I stepped out onto the balcony and held the iron rail tightly with both hands. I saw the creature standing a short distance away on the rooftops. My room was such that only a short jump could take you from the balcony onto the first of the roofs, and then away across the top of the city. I followed him. He turned and grinned at me, beckoned me to follow with one slender arm. His teeth gleamed white in the dark. I followed him then, racing across the rooftops, my heart pounding to keep up with his swift strides. I stumbled and tripped countless times, and always he was yards ahead, his soft, confident laugh guiding me and mocking me. The stars shone brightly, and soft billowing clouds floated by on almost imperceptible breezes. It seemed for hours that we ran, until we reached a part of the city that I was not familiar with. Sweat slicked my torso and ran painfully into my eyes. The creature stood perfectly still, on a roof slightly lower than the surrounding houses. He looked my way, and I could see a slight sheen to his white skin, as if the moonlight was liquefying on him. His hair hung as it always had throughout our race, lank, long and black, swaying slightly. He seemed to breathe not at all; as if the thousands of steps we had taken were mere memory to him, as if only I had exerted any energy. I stopped a few feet from him. 'Good, good,' he murmured. He nodded and held his hand to me, urging me to join him. I did. 'Where are we?' I asked. 'We are precisely...here.' he answered, a gleam in his eye. 'Why did you follow me?' 'I...I thought you wanted me to,' I stammered. 'Oh, I did,' he answered slowly, looking me up and down. 'We must go inside now. Dawn is approaching.' I looked to the horizon and saw no sign of approaching sun. I turned to tell him this, and he vanished. I saw him, standing at the edge of the rooftop, clinging to a ladder, looking at me. Always looking. 'Come.' So it began. The room in which I stood was austere and gothic, all sober tapestries and heavy curtains hanging over thick stone walls where windows should have been. It was a wonder I didn't know this building from the outside, for it must have been formidable to see. I remember nothing of the journey into its grand cocooning darkness, for the creature had helped me onto the ladder and then....nothing. I felt drugged by the same clouding redness that had assaulted me in my room, and when the fog cleared, here we were. I looked around me slowly, not wishing to appear scared, but knowing I was, feeling it to my very marrow. The creature was busying himself at the great fireplace, stacking thick logs over shredded paper and sticks. It seemed he had no matches, but soon a flicker of flame bit into the kindling. I watched the flames, as if to ground myself in whatever normality I could, until the fire was blazing, concentrating on the familiar and comforting sound of crackling sap and exploding knots. The creature stood. 'I am a vampire,' he said, without turning. 'My name is Ashen. You need not fear me.' I would have laughed had the situation not been so utterly dreamlike and alien to me. Somehow I knew he did not lie. Ridiculously, I began to reply with my own name. He swiftly held up a long fingered hand and drew it slowly into a fist like a closing flower. The sentence never left my lips. 'It matters not what you are called, my friend,' he began, 'only what you believe. Do you believe in vampires?' 'I ...' I could go no further. It was a question I would never have imagined having to answer, and yet here I was, with the words rattling about my mind. He waved his hand, as if to dismiss the thought as a troublesome fly. 'No matter.' He turned to me. The firelight lit his features so that his face appeared to burn, such was the luminescence of his flesh. Shadows stood out like tattoos across his sharp, angular bones and his hair became a deep toffee red where it had been black. My breath caught again in my throat for he had quite the most striking appearance. It was as if he was not of this world, or even of this time, and this idea grew in my mind until all my doubt and aversion to it was shed like the cracked and broken cocoon around an emerging butterfly. And strange as it may have been to me, that butterfly was this thought; that if I was to die this night, if it transpired that my life had reached its end and my lifeline cut with destiny's blade, then so be it. I have seen what it is to be godly, (for at this time, that is truly what I believed this thing to be) and I have known mortal fear and broken through it to utter understanding. There was nothing to hold me to life now, or rather, no experience that could ever match this. Oh, had I but known. I had taken in my surroundings the way one will when thrust into a situation against one's will. I had noticed everything and yet seen nothing. I looked again now, and saw meagre light from several sputtering candles, dripping fat gobbets of dark ochre wax onto the heavily carpeted floor. I saw a table and chair against one wall, no cup or plate on the table, only a thick book and several pens, expensive silver nibs and turned bone handles looking incongruous in the severity of their setting. There were no windows and I could see no door through which we must have come. I saw no other furniture and in my mind I marked this place as not so much lodgings as prison cell. Only the warmth from the fire (for despite the summer night, this room was as chill as a mausoleum) dispelled the prison image from my mind. I grew brave as the fire crackled its comforting dialogue. 'Where are we?' The creature started as if he had forgotten I was there and turned to face me. 'Ah..' he smiled and it was a return to the awful shifting rictus from my room. I held back a shudder. 'We are in my house. I live here.' 'But...' I started. 'Underground, about 8 miles from your room.' 8 miles! Had we really travelled so far? 'Why are we here, underground?' I asked with no small tremor in my voice. He looked at me as if genuinely surprised. 'Because you followed me from your room, and because this is my house.' I opened my mouth but found nothing there with which to counter this statement. 'Please sit,' he said and motioned to the one chair in the room. I did as he bid, and found even the bare wooden structure offered not only immeasurable physical comfort (I never felt such relief at taking the weight off my feet), but also comfort of a emotional kind. As I ran my still shaking hands over the chair back, I recognised their design from my grandmother's house many years ago. I smiled. He looked for a moment confused at my smile, and I stored that knowledge deep in my mind. I had no idea whether it would furnish me with a way of escape, but it seemed important. 'Thank you,' I replied after some minutes. He inclined his head softly and came to sit on the table next to me. 'Would you care for anything to drink?' The moment was so familiar, so understandable, and so normal, that I stuttered my answer, and he rose and walked to the far end of the room. Tucked into a corner, hidden from my view as a result of the darkness there, was a small chest. He lifted the lid and took out a small bottle swishing with dark amber liquid. He brought it, along with two exquisitely cut crystal glasses to the table. The sound of the liquor pouring filled my senses and the smell, a particularly fine brandy, wafted to me and set my head reeling from its strength and warmth. I gulped without thinking and coughed violently. He chuckled. The sound was not pleasant, a forced laugh sounding almost as if he had had to learn the trick of it. I sipped slowly the rest of the drink and set the glass carefully down on the table. It was perhaps the finest thing I had ever drunk and I told him so. He shrugged his thin shoulders and poured me a second glass. I held out my hand in a gesture that I hoped would stop him from pouring further, but I only appeared to be thanking him. 'It is time,' he said, and with those three words, words that I had heard thousands of times in my life, my heart went cold, and my stomach knotted. 'Time,' I said, managing to keep my dry mouth from swallowing the words before they were uttered. 'Let me explain,' he continued. 'I am a vampire,' he said. He emphasised this last word with undisguised venom, as if the mere word revolted him. 'There are not so many of us left as popular gossip would have you believe, perhaps half a hundred. I am by no means the oldest, but there are more vampires younger than me than there are those older. I do not recall the means of my creation clearly, nor the year of it, and of my time as a human I have no recollection whatsoever. That time is mere folklore to me now, and for all I know, it may never have happened.' He stood slowly and stretched his back. The gesture was so human that for a moment I forgot where I was and what he claimed to be; what I knew him to be. 'I need blood in order to live. I must have the blood of humans or pigs, but nothing else. I cannot digest food as you do. It would sit in my stomach and rot. I would grow sick and die.' He seemed to ponder this for a moment before continuing. 'The heat of the sun will kill me. The blood of the dead. Nothing else.' He looked at me as if to garner my reaction, but in truth I was overcome. I had no doubt that he told me the truth. My hands shook with the scope of it. I managed to voice a thought. 'Why are you telling me this?' He chuckled. 'You may wonder if I am happy with what I have? Whether I give any thought after so many decades to my situation, and what I could have done to prevent it? Well, after so many years, any thought of what and when and how becomes irrelevant. And yet the why of it intrigues me still. Why must I drink blood in order to live, where you may eat meat and bread? Why may I not enjoy warmth on rays? I long to taste bread once more. I long to have warmth on my skin that is not generated by fire or electricity.' I swallowed audibly and checked myself in the act of pouring another drink. He saw me and smiled. 'Please,' he gestured with a thin hand. I poured and drank, allowing the effects of the alcohol to numb slightly the effects of his rhetoric. He continued. 'Strength I have, uncommon strength. Money I have. Security and all the...food..' (for my benefit, I am sure, he paused and gave that last considerable thought and accent), '..I need. I have all that. Has it been so long since my own humanity that I forget the smell of daylight? I grow weary of the night, of the blood, even of the strength. I need to feel the simple joy of a summer's day on my face, the helpless weakness of humanity.' He sat once more on the table next to me and held his head in his hands. I quelled a feeling of revulsion as I imagined having to comfort him in his distress. I was spared that decision as he lifted his head. His face was dry of tears and emotionless. His eyes were black holes and showed me nothing of the man he must once have been. I pushed back into my chair. 'Simple really, John.' This familiarity shocked me because until know he had not addressed me in any way. I never thought he may know my name. He looked into my eyes, as much as he could with his cold shark's eyes, and spoke to my mind as he had done at the start of all this. Simple. 'I wish to change places with you. I want mortality and the only way I am to achieve this is to take yours.' There was such confidence and surety in his thoughts that I crumbled beneath them. I am ashamed to admit that I cried then. Not inward, noble tears. Great wracking sobs as the weight of his words struck me. All thoughts of escape left me then. I hadn't noticed until that moment, but his cold hand encircled my wrist, the tips of the fingers easily touching at the pulsing veins. I felt a charge in his touch, not unpleasant, but I was sure that it was another of his glamours used to ensnare me. I knew he would kill me then and I steeled myself against the pierce of tooth or knife or bullet. He bent his great head and bit suddenly, savagely, at my throat, where neck and jaw met, rending the flesh there; releasing my blood into his mouth. I cried out, but was powerless to defend myself. I let him drink, and waited for death. It never came however, for even as I could hear my heart beating like a drum in my ears, feel the pulse of it at my wrist, as if it would beat strongest at the last to defy him, he released me and I fell limp against the chair-back. The sound and heat of my heartbeat settled and faded like a great ship's engines over the horizon. He stood back from me, and I saw my fluids give life to his otherwise deathly pallor. He flushed a pale rose, and as soon as the colour came, it faded. He sighed and shut his eyes for a moment, and this time a single red tear streaked his face from eye to jaw line. I was as immobile as a statue then, as if he had taken not only my blood but also my will. 'It has begun, John,' he whispered. I saw a mist collecting around his form, more leaving him through pores and orifices, and all else went dark, so that I could see his aura and nothing else. It formed exactly the contours of his body and once free from him, the mist took shape in front of him as a perfect copy. It spoke. 'This happens every time I feed, John. I do not pretend to understand it. I like to think of it as my true self, leaving the nastiness of consumption and digestion to my physical being, while I am free for a few moments to enjoy life as I once did, I think. Perhaps even before mortality bound me, and immortality freed me.' The mist shape looked pensively at me. 'Ashen, the mortal.' He stretched his ghostly limbs and he was impossibly big then. I closed my eyes, the only movement afforded me it seemed, and when I reopened them, he was as he had been. 'Why I have never fully tried what I am about to try, I am not sure,' he said. I took immeasurable discomfort in his words and tried to move away from his mist. My limbs were leaden, and I could not move. My eyes flicked back and forth like a wild horse, and I snorted and frothed like some rabid beast before him. He hushed me, knelt by my side and laid a transparent hand on my brow. I calmed. Against all my will and my instincts, I calmed. 'Yes,' he said. 'It happened like this, a year ago. I had fed deeply; the mortal was lying as you are lying, close to death but not yet dead. I could still feel his heartbeat; still hear the ragged hiss of his last breaths. I knelt by him as I am now, and my mist form was pulled toward him. I could not prevent it, and I didn't try. I actually lay on his prone body and felt myself sinking into him! Can you imagine that, John?' I admit I couldn't imagine any such thing. 'My God, John, I was becoming one with this man who had late become my sustenance. I was terrified, and used all my will to repel myself. I felt the strength of the mortal's soul doing the same and I left him to die. I could not feed for days afterwards. The episode had frightened me more than anything has frightened me for centuries. Could it be done? Could I become a mortal by taking a body?' He left off then, as if to leave his words for me to digest as his physical body was digesting my blood. I flicked my eyes to look upon the body, and it stood still, eyes open but empty, no movement whatsoever from its limbs or head. It looked nothing so much as a photograph. The Ashen that was mist before me swirled and eddied like smoke, and yet was as clear to me as anything I had ever seen. I digested his words, as was his wish. I tried to move again, but again I felt an unseen and immense pressure preventing me from doing so. I was terrified, mortally terrified, for I had long ago stopped fearing death. I now feared for my soul, and although I am not a religious man, I prayed then. I prayed I would have the strength to repel this mist being from entering my body and ousting my quivering soul. 'I knew it was possible then. I knew I could become mortal again. A year has passed, John, and I found you asleep and for no other reason than I liked the look of your face as you slept, I wanted to try again. So here we are.' I wept. I cannot say for certain that I know the exact time that he began his assault. I felt rather than saw the misty shape begin to dissipate and felt what I can only describe as my soul begin to curl away, like paper from a flame. It began in my fingertips and moved slowly through my arms. I fought as best I could, and as the assault continued, I began to feel less and less like I was a part of it. It seemed that I was above looking down at the rape, for surely that's what this was. I found a measure of strength and pushed against his intrusion. Images, like the ones that had entered my head when I had first met Ashen, struck me again; blood and flesh and death. I held onto those images as long as I could, for they tied me to a time when I was mortal, when I was terrified, and when I was me. My torso constricted suddenly, and I sat up. I felt elated, as if I had won the greatest battle. I turned to find the shape in the mist, and was horrified to find my prone body lying where it had been all along. I looked at my hands, looked through them almost, and in my moment of distraction, he finished it. It was too easy. I offered him no fight, and he took me, and then it was done. My body sat, and then stood. I could not move from where I was. When finally I did turn, the mechanics of it nearly drove me insane. There was no thought or physical exertion. Rather I felt like smoke in a wind, and went where the wind took me. I screamed then, and it was the howl of a wind and I felt my mouth stretch impossibly wide to allow the sound to escape. Meanwhile, my body, Ashen, was rushing through the room, knocking chairs this way and that, howling, beating his hands on his chest and face. Almost by accident it seemed, he found the door to this place, and turning the handle, he was gone. Panic hit me like a physical blow to the face. I felt myself dispersing, swirling, and I used whatever thought I had left to drag my components together, to draw all my smoke and shade into one coherent form. How I managed it is a mystery and my mind seemed to go blank with the effort. Suddenly I felt utter despair and a feeling that in mortal terms was like terror and loneliness and paranoia. I cried out, a wind's breath, and was drawn to the only thing I recognised; the only thing that my soul needed at that time. Physicality. Of course. I took his body as he had taken mine. It was an easy transition. I thought of the movements needed and they were there in my powers. The mist that I had become edged toward the still body of the vampire, and by every hole and orifice and pore, I entered it, and filled it perfectly. There was silence and then there was cacophony. I covered my ears and the sound of skin on skin was like two granite slabs being pulled over one another. I screamed and screamed, and dropped to my knees. I felt warmth coursing through me and I knew that this was my blood I could feel. His last meal. I took nourishment from it, as I had always done. A mirror hung from the far wall, and in its length I saw the creature I had become. 'Ashen,' I whispered. I let my sight go dark with some mechanism I scarcely understood, and curled like a foetus on the stone floor. All went silent and dark. That was six months ago. Had I but known it, I had forced myself into a hibernation that vampires need after every feed. It lasted until the next sunset, about ten hours, and I woke then, and stood and looked about my prison. I found pen and paper and set about writing the words that have become my tale. Of my body, my mortal body, there was no sign. I felt a kind of distant loss, but no more. That has grown in the intervening months, until now, in the dead of winter, my loss and fear has grown into a deep and powerful hatred. Let me explain the nature of this beast that I find myself. As I woke that night, it seemed I knew what it was to be a vampire. I knew of the threats to my survival; the sun and dead blood. Of course, Ashen had told me these things almost in passing, but was he preparing me? Did he want me to preserve this body for him when he had grown tired of the mortal charade? Surely he knew that, as a vampire, I would be too strong for him? I knew of the feeding that I must do, and I survived for the first of those months on the blood of pigs. The first mouthful I took caused such violent rejection that I could have died right there and then, for I was laid out prone, shivering fits of nausea preventing any movement, until the warmth of the sun became the pain and fear of approaching death. I made it back to this place with minutes to spare, and now my skin has the darkened hue of sunburn. I like it that way. I am ashamed to admit that I have taken humans now. I feel for them, but rather like a human may sometimes regret the death of an animal so that he might eat. It is no more than that, and the blood sustains me and thrills me like the blood of pigs never did. It is an unexplainable sensation to drink human blood as a vampire, and I will not try to contort its pleasures into words here. I knew of my strength, for that first pig, and the first human I took, both died of such severe spine trauma, such was the force that I fed, that I was again in grave danger, this time from drinking their dead blood. I could scale buildings, and cloak myself, shield myself from eyes that had no business seeing me. As I have mentioned, I know not of any of these mechanisms. It is just my nature and I know how to do these things. And of my mortal self? I am sure he assumed me dead, burned in my first sunrise. I am not dead, and in not realising this when he finally took up residence in my mortal home, he has made a grave error. I saw him for the first time tonight, and I have planned and seethed and raged for so long, that I was almost powerless to approach. I shielded myself from him, and followed him, letting the thirst grow in me till the anticipation was almost unendurable. Where he has been these months, I do not care. Tomorrow will be his last day in my home, for I have learned his trick. I feed, and I feed, and at the last, I allow my soul-mist to leave my body. That first time, I stood and watched my stillness as I watched my prey breathe and stutter her last, and I knew I could do it. Timing will be everything, for I must have my body at the break of dawn, and allow him nowhere to hide. That will be the trick of it. My night of Ashen is over. Mortality awaits me. Pray for me.

10,00009,unknown,"Abraham edged towards the body. The gun lay broken across the crook of his arm, the spent shells lying in the mud some ten feet behind him. There was still the faint smell of gunpowder in the air, but the breeze was taking care of that. A fresher smell, blood perhaps, rode the breeze towards him and he used his spare hand to stop his nostrils before the smell made him lose his breakfast. He nudged the body with the toe of his boot, leaving traces of muddy water on the pale skin, the fine hair there streaking into darker lines where the water ran. The body was torn by a hole in the chest, its edges still running with blood. Traces of silver shot were visible in the depths of the wound, and they smoked like tiny meteors in the darkness. The rising of the chest was so faint as to be almost imperceptible, but it was there. Abraham's training allowed him to see it, to hear the ragged breaths as they passed the jaws, still heavily furred and dripping pink frothy saliva. The eyes were open still, and as he bent towards them, blocking the sunlight, the pupils expanded until the iris was almost invisible. A blink. The tongue snaked around the jaws, mopping the saliva, wetting the teeth as if preparing for a final bite. Was there recognition in those eyes? Abraham thought not. He twitched almost imperceptibly, and an urge to urinate almost overcame him. His eyes blurred at the sight of so much blood, and he swallowed saliva continuously. An itching began deep in his bones as if they were attempting to re-knit themselves. He ignored it, pushed it away. He blinked his eyes to clear the blurring and looked down at the fallen creature. It began to stir. Abraham took this as his cue to stand. He reloaded the weapon, the shells prepared early that morning. As the body rose, its body human, its feet and hands still clawed and covered with wiry hair, as its jaws began their relentless champing anew, Abraham fired. The body fell once more; feet slender and elegant, its hands once more five-fingered and pale. Abraham knelt beside it, brushing the hair from above its eyes, exposing a broad forehead, upon which blood had sprayed like a red fan. He crossed himself and spoke. 'My brother,' he said, and removed the gloves that he used to load the weapon. It took little more than five minutes to remove the head and bury it along with hands and feet in a shallow grave some distance from the body. The skin had turned a mottled grey in death, and Abraham's knife cut through skin and bone and muscle and sinew like it was so much curd wrapped in cheese cloth. He marked the grave simply, with a twisted crucifix of green willow and sprinkled the site with a few drops of his own blood from a vial around his neck. He left the wood as light fell around him, stopping only to urinate against a tree, the pungent yellow liquid steaming in the cooling air. Abraham allowed himself a smile and marked a notch onto the butt of his weapon with a sharp fingernail. Its white streak became a twin for the one already there, although that one was darkening. He began to whistle as he walked, and soon the last tree was far behind him, leafy paths turned to black tarmac and the lights of the city began to call to him. 'Leave the bottle,' he growled at the barman. He had taken a table in the bar farthest from the window and threw his feet up onto the stool opposite. Dried mud and leaves rained to the stained floor, although they did little to dirty the place further. Abraham poured a generous splash of vodka and drank it down in one, using his tongue to gather a few stubborn drops of the icy, syrupy liquid from his glass. He waited. The vodka warmed him from within and he replenished his glass, sipping this time to extend the life of his drink. He may be here all night. His gun lay fully loaded under the table, in a holdall alongside another dozen shells. Traces of silver dust coated them all so that to see them in the light gave them an unearthly sheen, as though they were coated in moonlight. He nudged the bag lightly with his foot, as if to assure himself that it was still there. As he drank, he stroked a finger along a long scar down his forearm. It shone pink against the tanned skin there, and no hair grew over it. It was a stark reminder that to let your guard down was to invite death. The gash, caused by the claws of another of Abraham's brothers, (the first he had eventually killed, notch number one), had bled for three straight days, and by the end, Abraham was in danger of dying from the infection and blood loss. He proved strong enough however, and in time the wound healed. He took it as a sign, and took time to study it before and after he hunted. Just to remember. Of Abraham's four brothers, two lay dead, one still cooling in the earth. Of the two remaining alive, Marten was the oldest and largest. He sat in his Ford Mustang watching Abraham through the window of the bar. His lip curled defensively up from his teeth and a low growl escaped him. He drummed his fingers impatiently on the steering wheel. 'Come on, brother, come out where I can have you,' he whispered to no one in particular. He meant to end Abraham's life tonight, but as much as he wanted it, dreamt about it in fact, he couldn't do it in full view of the bar. People just would not understand. He considered calling home, arranging a rendezvous with one of his girls, but it had taken nearly a week to track his brother and he did not want to let him out of his sight now. He checked the time. It had just gone ten, and the moon hung like a glass eye above him. Marten rolled the sleeves up on his shirt, noted the coarse hair on his forearms and cursed. Too damn much. 'Come on, Abraham. I will not come in for you,' he whispered again. He felt the familiar stirrings in his gut, a buzzing in his head like the onset of tinnitus. He shook his head, and was alarmed at the spit that flew from his mouth. Already? He cursed again and checked himself in the rear view mirror. His eyes had gone grey. They were ringed with gold, and his eyelashes were thick and black. Even as he watched his cheeks began to hollow. He growled. Too damn late! He wrenched the car into gear and roared away from the bar. At least he now knew Abraham's movements. There would be other nights. Inside the bar, Abraham smiled. He stood and slung his holdall over his shoulder. He could smell burning rubber from Marten's tyres, and even the vodka hadn't dimmed his senses so much that he hadn't been able to sense his brother from the second he pulled up outside. Marten did nothing to disguise his musk, and the raw sound of his breathing was audible even through the walls of the bar. Abraham left the bar. Rain had begun to fall, washing out the clarity of his sight so that it appeared he was looking at the world through a veil. It slicked the dark hair to his scalp, on the backs of his hands. He followed a trail of rubber on the tarmac, and when that faded, he followed the heat from the car's exhaust, and when that faded, he followed his nose. Marten was the easiest to track, but would be by no means the easiest to kill. He would have preferred to take on Simon first, the only other surviving brother, but he would take them as and when the opportunity arose. He looked at the moon through the rain, and closed his eyes against both the iridescent orb, and against the buzzing that had begun in his head. Too much vodka, he thought. He pushed the buzzing away deep down in himself, willed the itching that irritated his very marrow to cease. Once again in control of himself, he walked on. The house loomed out of the darkness. He approached it from the front, content that Marten and the girls would be safely ensconced in the cellars. He could smell their musk on the wind, and in it, he could discern eight in all. So he had gathered another one. Abraham smiled again, mindful of the tautness across his face that he was sure hadn't been so pronounced only days ago. He had to be quick. He pulled his gloves on, smoothing the tight leather so that they almost formed a second skin, and pulled his shotgun from the holdall. He check the chambers, content that he had loaded it before entering the bar, but checking anyway, loving the smell of gunpowder and silver that rose from the dark metal barrel. The itching in his bones began anew, and this time he let it come. His head buzzed, familiarly, and he shook the noise out like it was a fly in his ear. He flexed his hands and felt the seam at the tip of one finger split. He stared at the frayed cotton and smiled. 'My brothers,' he whispered. 'It ends tonight.' He turned towards the side door of the house. He felt the approach through his feet rather than heard it, and because he wasn't relying of the slow passage of sound through the air, he was able to anticipate, turn and deflect the worst of the blow that came pummelling down on him through the night air. It was Simon. His eyes glowed bright silver and there were tufts of coarse hair sprouting from his hands and forearms. He was hunched as if his back was bowed, and from his mouth, along with the frothy spit and curses, came a steadily rising howl that set the hair on Abraham's neck standing. The itching intensified, and he found his hand could barely form a fist around the trigger of the gun. Simon had backed off after the initial attack, to better assess his opponent's position, and found he was staring into death itself. Abraham used the delay to leap backwards, holding the shotgun trained on Simon the whole time. He dropped to his knee and steadied the gun across the bridge of one arm and held its weight easily with the other. His eyes widened as the shotgun fired, and he cursed as he followed the trail of the silver shot over Simon's bowed head. His brother wasted no time and renewed his attack, transforming as he came. Hair thickened, and the face that had once thrilled Abraham in its ability to open the legs of so many willing girls, sagged, stretched and broke apart with the arrival of the beast. The hunched back cracked audibly and lengthened, pushing hair through the ruined shirt. Feet and hands became clawed, furred things. The curses that spat from Simon's mouth almost liquidly dissolved into growls. It took no more than the leaping attack to complete his change. He stood facing Abraham, a huge wolf, snarling and snapping at the very air as if to use it to drag his brother closer to the ravening jaws. Abraham kept his eyes on the creature, amazed as always when one of his brothers changed, but no less intent on ending him. He feigned a jump back, and as Simon hunched to leap at him, he stood suddenly and threw the shotgun over itself so that he was holding the barrel, brandishing it like a club. The wolf came in range and Abraham brought the stock of the shotgun clean down upon the wide brow bone. A single whimper escaped the wolf's jaws, and the life went out of it. He shook as he reloaded, and bent briefly to stroke the blood-matted fur on his brother's head. 'Brave one,' he whispered and crossed himself. He shot Simon dead, the silver shot smoking as it passed through the brain and neck. He looked down at the ruin at his feet, and reloaded once more. He scanned the house for movement, saw none. He tightened his fists again, so alarmed at the splits in the gloves that he cast them off. He closed his eyes and willed the itching to cease, willed the buzzing in his head to abate for just a few moments more. He made to move for the house, forgetting the corpse of his brother, now fully human, fully dead. He stopped only to urinate on the side of the house, a great steaming arc of yellow in the night, obliterating the stench already smeared there. Marten. It was his house after all. 'I'm coming, brother,' he said to himself, flexing his hands as if to drive the feelings away. Marten heard the shot, felt the loss of his brother as he had felt the loss of all his younger siblings. Abraham. There was just the two of them left now. He pushed the girl away from his lap, and she turned to mewl at him like a cat. He bared his teeth and growled. She quietened and slunk back to his harem, content to nuzzle and caress there. Abraham should never have got so close. Had he taken on too many for his harem? Were they clouding him? And not one had yet provided him his progeny. Marten was furious but knew that he had strength on his side. And of course, Abraham thought he still had surprise on his side. Marten laughed. The girls looked up suddenly at this change in him, smiles forming briefly. The smiles died as they saw the fierce grey glint in his eyes, recognised the twitching skin and thickening hair that signal Marten's own elaborate change. They went back to their business, unwilling to draw his attention this time. He howled. Marten bounded across the room, a great black wolf, eyes glowing silver-grey. His hands and feet were the last to change, the pale skin drawing back like a drawn curtain, revealing thickly furred, clawed paws that resembled those of a wolf, only bigger. The claws were longer and sharper. His bones creaked as he ran, the burrowing itch fading only as the transformation completed. He stopped suddenly and turned to look at his girls. They shrank away from him, a growing murmur coming from them as they admired him, feared him, desired him. He was their lord. He was their love. They fell upon each other, biting and kissing and licking and shrieking their delight as he looked at each of them in turn. Marten could hear their shrieks as he left the room and tore up the long flight of stairs that led to the main house. He heard the cries turn to barks and howls as he ran, his sharp ears picking out each girl, his lightning mind turning their face over and over, remembering their smell, their place. As much as was possible to him now, he smiled. It would end tonight. The wolf approached Abraham slowly, its head fixed, as if its grey eyes were attached to his with an invisible cord. Abraham, to his credit, stayed his ground, although the wolf, even on all fours, could have pressed its nose into his chest. 'Brother, we can be only one. As it has always been, so it is now.' he whispered, nodding deferentially. The wolf's tail twitched and raised high above its back, the hackles joining its base to the mane at its neck standing as though electrified. Abraham knew that this was exactly what his brother was feeling. Electricity. For a moment he felt insanely jealous, but then remembered his duty here. His hands groped at the trigger on the shotgun almost blindly, and he pushed hard down within himself, quelling the insane itching that threatened to undo him from within. The wolf edged forward, it head lowered, spittle drooling from the black lips, eyelids half closed. Abraham took the moment of quiet and swung the gun around to the front, pulling the trigger almost simultaneously. The roar from the gun was tremendous, matching easily the roar from his wounded brother. Blood flecked the wall behind the wolf, the wound in his shoulder dripping onto the hard wood floor. The wolf's front paws skidded in the mess and he clattered his sharp claws trying to find purchase. Abraham knew he had no time to reload, and threw the gun down, reaching instead to his coat pocket. The knife there was ebony handled, with a blade of silver. He brushed against the cutting edge and it sank in to him. He smelled the raw smoke of burning skin and withdrew his hand quickly. He thrust in again, having realised the blade's geography in his pocket, and this time grasped the handle firmly and withdrew the knife. All this happened in a matter of seconds, and in that time, the wolf's wound had closed, the blood dried to a crust in his fur. He faced Abraham, strengthened by the pain and fear, and the lips drew back to reveal gums as black as night, threaded through here and there with flecks of pink. The wolf's teeth dripped with saliva, and his tongue lolled to taste the air. A low growl had begun deep in his chest, and Abraham matched it with his own, the combatants both showing their readiness to fight. It was Abraham who struck first, not content to give his brother the edge. The knife sliced through skin and fur and gristle, opening a ghastly wound in the creature's flank. Again the smell of gunpowder and scorched hair filled the room. The wolf howled his pain, and flinched away from the bite of the silver, snapping at Abraham's hands as he went. The second bite took skin and blood with it, and Abraham clutched the injured limb to his chest, growling deeper. The itching was unbearable now and he shook his head violently to dislodge it. A fierce buzzing had started in his ears, and he used his uninjured hand to wipe a sheen of pink sweat from his face. Even through the haze of hormonal battle, he could hear the rasp of his hand against the stubble. He shouted his anger and was alarmed at the barking sound. The wolf came in low, snatching at the cloth of his jeans, snapping and tearing so that his leg was laid bare in seconds. He dodged the next thrust, bringing the knife down hard with both hands, ignoring the swelling pain in one of them. The blade struck bone this time and the wolf screamed. Hot breath steamed the air, and Abraham smelled meat and blood and fear. He prised the blade free and struck again. He dropped the blade suddenly, unable to hold the blood-slicked handle. The wolf was still, breathing heavily, coughing blood in a violent pink mist before it, and Abraham took his chance. He straddled the great creature, reaching around its throat to grasp great hanks of skin and fur. He pulled these tight in opposite directions and the wolf struggled, feeling its air supply dying. Elated in victory, Abraham growled, and elation turned to anger and then fear as the growl turned to a howling bark and his hands sprouted hair and the fingers crumpled into deadly claws. His grip on the wolf lessened, and he felt the bones in his body re-knitting themselves to match those of his opponent. 'NO! It is too soon!' he cried, but what came out was a bark. He leapt from the back of his brother and landed on his hands and knees, still able to walk upright, but stooping with the weight of his elongating head. The wolf sprang up and turned on him. They fell as one hard onto the floor, snapping and writhing against one another. With a great splintering crash, the combined weight drove them through the floor and into the cellars below. Abraham heard his brother exhale in one giant rush of air as they collided with the stone floor beneath, scattering the harem in a screaming wave. He swung his head and looked and saw the ragged end of a floorboard protruding from his brother's chest and one more through his neck. Hot blood pulsed across them like a half-submerged stone in a river. The great wolf's eyes dimmed and the grey fire died in them. Abraham snapped weakly at the prone wolf, drew his black lips back and snarled into its face. He raised himself up, crawled away from the cooling body, and licked slowly at his own wounds, tasting his own as well as his brother's blood on his fur. The world dimmed as Abraham's body became his master. He twitched his tail and fell into the greyness. Abraham woke and stood naked in the chilled cellars of his brother's house. His house now, he presumed. He smiled as one of his girls entered the room. He held out his hand to her. 'Marten?' he asked. The girl flattened herself against him. 'Buried,' she whispered, running her nails along the length of his thigh. 'The head?' 'Gone, of course,' she laughed. The itch seated itself deep in Abraham's bones. He shut his eyes and let it come. 'It's mine, then?' he asked. The girl at his side howled her reply and stood away from him, raising her tail, exposing herself to him. She barked at him over her shoulder and he dropped to all fours to join her. Abraham silently remembered his fallen brothers, and realised he could no longer feel the itch in his bones or the buzzing in his head. His back arched, and he looked to the ceiling and howled. He followed his queen into the largest room and smelled the musk and heat of his harem. They fell upon him as one, all lust and claws and teeth. There was young to make. ",candidate00002
11,00010,unknown,"Harold Lutz squinted in concentration over his glasses as he added a ribbon to the dark curls of the busty maiden on the front of the ship. He pursed his lips for a moment, grunted in satisfaction, then set down the tiny paintbrush and reached for the jar of varnish. It wasn't until she walked into the basement that Harold realized Alice was shouting at him. ""Are you down here again?"" she asked, even though the answer was obvious. ""Harold, I asked you to mow the lawn today. Violet and Margaret are picking me up for bridge tonight, and I won't have our yard looking like something out of the Wild Kingdom. Honestly, I don't know why I even bother asking you."" She paused to inhale, but before she could start again Harold stood up, apologized meekly, and shuffled past his wife and up the stairs. ""And don't forget to use the rake,"" she called out behind him. The lawnmower jostled for space in the tool shed with Alice's potting soil, two cans of yellow house paint, assorted garden hoses, and a rusty bicycle. Harold wiggled it away from the bicycle and rolled it around the side of the house and through the weathered gate into the front yard. He adjusted his glasses, then leaned over and gave a sharp tug on the pull cord. Three more times, and the engine sputtered and coughed itself into life. Alice was yelling something from the porch. ""Harold, I said don't forget to sweep the sidewalk."" She paused and took a drink from her iced tea. ""You always forget to sweep the sidewalk. It's part of the yard too, you know."" She turned and let the screen door slam behind her. Harold muttered ""yes, dear,"" and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve. Then he straightened his glasses and walked back to the shed to get the broom and the rake. By the time he finished up, Violet and Margaret were just pulling into the driveway. Alice called out over her shoulder that she'd be home late, and Harold waved as the three of them drove off. He wondered if Alice had left any of that iced tea. Turning back to his pile of grass clippings, he loaded them into the trash can and lugged the can back behind the shed. He squinted in the afternoon glare as he dragged the can back into place and pushed it up against the wall with his foot. Alice didn't like the trash cans to block the walkway between the shed and her rhododendrons. He grabbed the other can and moved it a little to one side. Satisfied, he brushed off his hands. He turned to go back inside and noticed the ants. Must have disturbed them, he thought. The ground around the can was a scurrying mass of alarmed activity. He squatted down and peered over the tops of his glasses. They were just regular black ants, the kind boys feed grasshoppers to, or zap with their magnifying glasses. He grinned and rocked the trash can back and forth a few times. The ants scurried back and forth, sending out their silent alarm. ""Earthquake!"" he said, and chuckled. He watched for a moment more, then stood up and walked back to the house. He was relieved they weren't sugar ants. He thought about ant poison and a trip to the hardware store. This was followed by the thought of the unfinished Santa Maria, and he immediately remembered his unvarnished poop deck and tiny paintbrushes. He hurried inside, carefully closing the backdoor behind him. At work the next day, it occurred to him that he liked shipbuilding better than his job. Harold was in accounting, and had been for the past 34 years. He never really liked it, he thought. He didn't even care when Artie Graham got promoted after ""old man"" Ross had retired. He told Alice he thought it was probably for the best. Alice didn't think it was for the best. ""I don't understand you Harold, I really don't,"" she said, and waved her fork for emphasis. ""You told me yourself that Bill Ross was looking for a replacement. And you stood there and let him pick that child?"" Harold focused on his meatloaf. ""Why Harold? Don't you think I deserve a nice car like Violet? Or to be able to wear a new dress just once in a while?"" Her voice was getting louder. ""Of course, who am I talking to? You've never stood up to anyone in your whole life."" Her eyes started to fill with tears. ""Nobody respects you Harold. Not Bill, and certainly not Artie Graham. And you know what? I-"" She caught herself and stared at Harold quietly chewing his meatloaf. ""You're just hopeless,"" she finally spat out. She pushed back her chair and went into the kitchen. Harold sat and finished his meatloaf while Alice banged the pots and pans in the sink. ""You could at least take the trash out,"" she finally said. Harold walked into the kitchen and took the pail out from under the sink while Alice stood to one side, glaring. She closed the cabinet door with her foot and went back to clanking plates in the sink. Harold stood watching her back for a moment, then shrugged and stepped out the back door. The cool air on the back porch felt good after the warm day. It smelled faintly of lawn and the neighbor's barbecue grill. He looked over at the garden shed and remembered that he needed to put the grass clippings out with the trash on Tuesday. With a sigh, he eased down the steps and carried the trash pail over to the can behind the shed. The ants had gotten there first. Harold squinted at the wriggling stream coming from the large hill on the ground and flowing improbably up the side of the can and under the lid. He clucked his tongue and lifted the lid for a closer look. He set the pail down and examined the anthill. It was bigger than he remembered it. On a whim, he took the pen out of his pocket and pushed it into the ground near the entrance. Immediately, a group of scouts emerged, heads raised and ready for battle. Harold pushed up his glasses and smiled. ""En guard,"" he said and jousted three or four with the tip of his pen. ""Harold, are you ever coming back in?"" Alice's voice startled him, and he dropped the pen. ""I need the trash pail."" It wasn't until work the next day that he remembered his pen. Artie asked him to check on the Dupree account, and when he went to sign it out, he realized his pen was gone. He patted all of his pockets, searching, then remembered the anthill. He frowned. Alice didn't like ants. He'd have to do something to get rid of them. ""Is there something wrong Mr. Lutz?"" Mrs. Doyle asked. Harold looked up and realized he'd been daydreaming. ""Oh, I'm sorry,"" he said, ""I was thinking about some chores I need to do around the house."" ""Well, it's nice to hear a man at least thinking about chores. It's all I can do to get my Tom to mow the lawn."" She winked at him from behind her horned-rim glasses. ""Yes,"" Harold replied, and took a pen from her desk and initialed the register. ""But we can't all be ants Mrs. Doyle. The summer needs a few grasshoppers."" She laughed her horsey laugh, and he took the folder and went back to his desk. Alice was out when he got home. Tuesdays were book club night and trash night. Alice took care of the first, and Harold took care of the second. He unlocked the front door, took off his hat and set down his briefcase, then quickly changed out of his suit and tie and into his work clothes. Then it was through the kitchen and down into the basement. He flicked on the light switch and looked over at the gleaming white sails of the Santa Maria. Taped to the main mast was a large yellow piece of paper. It said ""TRASH!"" Harold looked at the note then checked his watch, then looked back at the note. He gingerly removed the tape, stuffed the note in his pocket, then turned off the light and slowly climbed the stairs again. Out at the shed, he put on his work gloves, then went around the side and jerked the handle of the can full of grass clippings. He halfdragged, half-carried it up the cement stairs and down the walkway to the street, then returned for the trash can. He grabbed it and hauled it to the curb, muttering and cursing under his breath then went back to the shed to take off his gloves. They were swarming with ants. ""Eechhh,"" he said in annoyance, and shook the gloves off. Instinctively, he checked his arms and clothes, then scratched a sudden itch behind his left ear. Satisfied, he looked down at his gloves. The ants had regrouped, and were streaming together back behind the shed. He followed them, and rubbed his eyes when he saw it. The anthill was still there, but larger than last time. Ants moved in a steady flow in and out of the entrance, some carrying food, others sand or debris. But the entrance was different. His pen was standing erect to one side, and there was a group of soldiers surrounding it. He leaned down and examined the scene. Four ants had made a square around the pen, with each one standing motionless in a corner. A little beyond that, dozens of ants marched together, forming a living circle around it. He reached out for the pen, but hesitated when he saw the circle slow to a stop. Slender feelers touched one another, uncertain, then one ant broke off and scurried down the hill and towards Harold's shoe. He waited, curious. The ant approached the sole of his shoe cautiously, pausing every few inches to wave its feelers in the air before moving forward again. Harold stood perfectly still, not wanting to frighten it off. Finally it seemed to gather its courage and climbed up the shoe. It stopped, facing him. It raised its feelers and front legs. Then it turned and climbed down and crawled eagerly back to the circle. Harold chuckled. ""I hope this means we can be friends,"" he said. The ants seemed to hear him, and started the march around the pen again. He stood up and looked around sheepishly. Then he chuckled again, and watched the pulsing circle of ants until the fading sunlight made it too hard to see. Harold sped home from work the next day, dropped his briefcase at the front door, and changed into his work clothes before he even said hello to Alice. ""You're home early,"" she said as he passed through the kitchen. ""I've got some things I needed to do around the house."" ""Well, that's a first,"" she said. Then, without turning around, she added ""And don't bother rushing so you can get back to your toys."" Harold froze. ""What's that?"" ""I said don't bother rushing your work outside so you can spend all your time in the basement with that damn boat of yours. I threw it away."" Harold's hands started to sweat and he felt slightly sick. He pushed up his glasses and said ""N-Now see here Alice, I-"" ""No Harold, you see here!"" She took a step forward and pointed her finger at him. ""I'm sick and tired of you wasting your days and nights on these ridiculous hobbies while other husbands are improving themselves. Do you think Artie Graham plays with toy boats? Ridiculous!"" ""W-What did you do Alice?"" He looked like an outclassed boxer. ""I told you, I threw it away. Right in the trashcan."" She brushed her hands for effect. ""And another thing,"" she held up her finger and shook it at him. ""There is an enormous anthill behind the shed. While you're outside you can take that can of gasoline and get rid of them."" Harold blinked slowly. He mouthed something like a fish gasping for air, but no sound came out. Alice tapped him in the chest. ""An anthill Harold. Get rid of it."" She stared hard at him until she was satisfied, then turned back to the sink, muttering. ""Nasty, disgusting creatures."" Harold took a step towards the door, then stopped. He looked at the doorknob for a full minute, then turned around. He stared at Alice standing at the sink in her green housedress and apron, then blinked several times. ""What?"" Alice growled. Harold's face was cold, but his voice was soft and warm. ""What anthill?"" She turned to face him. ""Don't tell me you haven't seen that gigantic anthill behind the shed?"" Harold shook his head dully. ""Do you think I'm an idiot?"" Harold shook his head again. ""No Alice, I just didn't see any anthill when I was out there yesterday."" She glared at him. ""You're the idiot!"" she finally screamed, and untied her apron. ""Come on,"" she said and stomped down the stairs. Harold followed her out the back door and back to the shed. She got there before him and jerked the empty trash can out of the way. ""Right there Harold! Do you see it now?"" She grabbed his arm and pulled him in front of the anthill. ""What do you call that Harold?"" She pulled over the other can and pushed it away with her foot. ""And that? What do you call it Harold?"" He looked down. In the light he thought he could just make out the circle of ants. They were still marching, guarding their monument. Harold looked around. It was later than he thought. The air was still warm, but it was getting dark. ""What do you call it?"" she asked again, pounding his arm with her fist. ""Friends,"" he finally said, and reached out with both hands and squeezed Alice's neck until he couldn't squeeze anymore. Then he crouched down and whispered. ""Dinnertime."" ",candidate00003
